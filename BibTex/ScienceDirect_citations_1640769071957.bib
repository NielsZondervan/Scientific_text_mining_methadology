abstract = {The future holds great promise for the use of autonomous vehicles. Many daily activities which require the use of extensive manpower, will soon be performed with much less human interference, if at all. City logistics is an example of one such arena, which will most surely benefit from the introduction of autonomous vehicles. Autonomous vehicles will replace human couriers in the near future, and conduct delivery tasks. Given the current trends in the freight industry, this will probably be integrated with the use of platoons, which has recently gained an increasing interest in the freight sector. In this paper we present an urban freight delivery system, which is based on the use of autonomous connected platoons. In the presented system, autonomous vehicles carry out delivery tasks, traveling from an origin depot to a customer, by joining platoons along the way, which bring them closer to their destination. Many issues can be analysed with respect to the proposed system. In this paper, we choose to focus on the travel time issue. In particular, we examine the effects different platoon configurations (total number of platoons in the network and their size) have on the travel time of the vehicles performing the delivery tasks. In order to examine the proposed system, a traffic microsimulation is used. A case study is presented, demonstrating the effects of varying the platoon number and size on the travel time. The results show a relation between the configuration of platoons and the travel time, especially with respect to the delay in intersections, and the waiting time while switching platoons.}

The last mile issue, that is the problem of the final stage of delivery of a parcel to a recipient, appears in full in urban areas. The problem of the last mile can be solved for the benefit of the environment through solutions called parcel machines. This paper aims to explore the relationship between environmental attitudes and behaviors of Generation Y and their propensity to make purchases over the internet and collect them using parcel machines. The study found that Generation Y respondents in Poland do not perceive parcel machines as an environmentally friendly method of delivery of products purchased online. On the other hand, young people would be willing to pay a bit more for an item if it were a form of an environment-saving measure. It is true that this correlation is not strong (r = 0.1785), but through a campaign dedicated to Generation Y (social media) environmental attitudes could be affected. There was no relationship between the amount of disposable income and the propensity among Millennials to use green solutions.}

abstract = {The logistical deployment of resources to provide relief to disaster victims and the appropriate planning of these activities are critical to reduce the suffering caused. Disaster management attracts many organisations working alongside each other and sharing resources to cope with an emergency. Consequently, successful operations rely heavily on the collaboration of different organisations. Despite this, there is little research considering the appropriate management of resources from multiple organisations, and none optimising the number of actors required to avoid shortages or convergence. This research introduces a disaster preparedness system based on a combination of multi-objective optimisation and geographical information systems to aid multi-organisational decision-making. A cartographic model is used to avoid the selection of floodable facilities, informing a bi-objective optimisation model used to determine the location of emergency facilities, stock prepositioning, resource allocation and relief distribution, along with the number of actors required to perform these activities. The real conditions of the flood of 2013 in Acapulco, Mexico, provided evidence of the inability of any single organisation to cope with the situation independently. Moreover, data collected showed the unavailability of enough resources to manage a disaster of that magnitude at the time. The results highlighted that the number of government organisations deployed to handle the situation was excessive, leading to high cost without achieving the best possible level of satisfaction. The system proposed showed the potential to achieve better performance in terms of cost and level of service than the approach currently employed by the authorities.}

So the aim of this paper is to develop efficient flexible long-term capacity planning policy for CLSCs that considers social responsibility or a supply chain with Reverse Logistics Social Responsibility (RLSR). This aim is to answer an important research question on how to tackle the lifecycle with its inherited uncertainty to achieve optimal sustainability dimensions performance. Here, a single-product System Dynamics (SD) model of the supply chain with RLSR is used. This SD model considers interrelated sustainability dimensions and adopts the product lifecycle with its inherited uncertainties, such as the length of the product lifecycle, pattern of the product lifecycle, and residence index. Finally, a mathematical model of the developed policy is constructed and a simplified non-linear multi-objective algorithm is proposed to solve this mathematical model. In addition, Taguchi Design is used to minimize the number of simulations needed in the numerical experiment. The findings of this study show that the developed policy could be used to tackle the lifecycle with its inherited uncertainty to optimize the sustainability dimensions performance. These findings have some limitations, however. The findings underscore this paper's contribution to the relatively limited but important academic knowledge on capacity planning development for research on social responsibility issues in CLSCs. In practice, the results will give managers a better understanding of how to tackle product lifecycle uncertainties in RLSR and will therefore lead to better capacity planning to achieve optimal sustainability dimensions performance.}

This study extends existing research on relationship management by exploring the effects of various transaction constraints on the use of contracts and relational norms. It also examines the effects of these two mechanisms on outsourcing performance. The analysis of data from 264 Chinese firms engaged in logistics outsourcing indicates that demand volatility has a negative effect on contracts but has no significant effect on relational norms. Supply volatility exerts an inverse U-shape effect on relational norms, but has no significant effect on contracts. When technology uncertainty prevails, firms are likely to increase their use of either contracts or relational norms. In contrast, when vendor contribution is highly unpredictable, firms will simultaneously reduce their use of contracts and relational norms. Furthermore, although relational norms enhance satisfaction more effectively than contracts, their positive effects on financial performance are not significantly different. These findings enrich relationship management research, especially with regard to control mode selection in situations of transaction uncertainty.}

In this regard, the forwarders have the need of operational collaboration with port logistics service providers and as a result, they achieve a high level of customer performance. Second, the high level of the inter-corporate commitment is connected to the high level of firm performance. The forwarders provide shippers with the quality of customer service through commitment with port logistics service providers and this is the cause of firm performance. Third, the high level of the inter-corporate communication is based on a gap in customer performance.

We find that, from the perspective of 3PL providers, uncertainty, order frequency, and transaction size, but not asset specificity, are significantly associated with 3PP service, which in turn is significantly associated with value-to-client and benefit-to-3PL provider. Existing studies have focused on investigating the basic services offered by 3PL providers using transaction cost analysis.

Traditionally relying on Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) they are dependent on correct and up-to-date input data. So far, little success has been reached in estimating the effects of disturbances for freight. This paper aims to contribute to the understanding of disturbances in freight transport by reviewing and classifying the effects occurring due to transport time variability (TTV) and to suggest a calculation model to estimate the value of transport time variability (VTTV). In order to validate the model and its usability it was successfully tested in a case study for a large Swedish retail company. The effects of delays can be divided into four main types: System Killers, Catastrophic Events, Expected Risks, and Contingencies, of which the last two are relevant for VTTV. The model applies these in a two-step cost function with a fixed and variable part, building on previous studies of VTVV for passenger transport based on the scheduling utility approach. A main theoretical result is that the estimation of VTTV is derived mathematically independently of which measure that is chosen for the quantification of TTV.}

Hence, this paper aims at developing a new integrated model in order to determine the optimum location-allocation and distribution plan, along with the best ordering policy for renewing the stocked perishable commodities at the pre-disaster phase. The uncertain nature of the problem leads to the utilization of a scenario-based robust stochastic approach. The proposed model simultaneously seeks to minimize: (1) the average of the weighted response times and (2) the total operational cost at the pre-disaster phase and the penalty costs of unmet demand and unused commodities at a post-disaster phase. The reservation level Tchebycheff procedure (RLTP) as an interactive approach is also applied to cope with the presented bi-objective model. The significance of the presented model and the efficiency of the RLTP method are then tested via a real case study in Iran.}

The purpose of this research is to test the hypothesis that internalisation of externality costs will encourage efficient supply chain behaviour, which will result in a shift to rail of rail-friendly traffic currently on road. Counterintuitively, the results indicate that increased returns to rail density due to such a modal shift could result in a lower total freight bill (inclusive of externality costs).

abstract = {The Intelligent Water Drop (IWD) algorithm is inspired by the movement of natural water drops (WD) in a river. A stream can find an optimum path considering the conditions of its surroundings to reach its ultimate goal, which is often a sea. In the process of reaching such destination, the WD and the environment interact with each other as the WD moves through the river bed. Similarly, the supply chain problem can be modelled as a flow of stages that must be completed and optimised to obtain a finished product that is delivered to the end user. Every stage may have one or more options to be satisfied such as suppliers, manufacturing or delivery options. Each option is characterised by its time and cost. Within this context, multi–objective optimisation approaches are particularly well suited to provide optimal solutions. This problem has been classified as NP hard; thus, this paper proposes an approach aiming to solve the logistics network problem using a modified multi–objective extension of the IWD which returns a Pareto set. Artificial WD, flowing through the supply chain, will simultaneously minimise the cost of goods sold and the lead time of every product involved by using the concept of Pareto optimality. The proposed approach has been tested over instances widely used in literature yielding promising results which are supported by the performance measurements taken by comparison to the ant colony meta-heuristic as well as the true fronts obtained by exhaustive enumeration. The Pareto set returned by IWD is computed in 4 s and the generational distance, spacing, and hyper–area metrics are very close to those computed by exhaustive enumeration. Therefore, our main contribution is the design of a new algorithm that overcomes the algorithm proposed by Moncayo-Martínez and Zhang (2011). This paper contributes to enhance the current body of knowledge of expert and intelligent systems by providing a new, effective and efficient IWD-based optimisation method for the design and configuration of supply chain and logistics networks taking into account multiple objectives simultaneously.}

Urban emergency rescue facility locations (UERFLs) problem is essentially a geospatial multi-objective optimization problem (Geospatial-MOP), which presents a challenge for both researchers and managers. In this study, a user-friendly decision support tool was designed and developed for facilitating the process of optimizing UERFLs in large-scale urban areas. We described the design, architecture and implementation of the tool and its core optimization component. Based on a hypothetical case study, we introduced its functionalities as well as the decision making workflow. The results provide evidences that the tool can successfully generate Pareto-optimal frontier and capture a pool of alternative solutions to the decision maker for trade-off. This work offers new insights on promoting future urban emergency logistics management with the use of GIS and emerging artificial intelligence technologies, and makes contributions in integrating multi-objective optimization algorithm with GIS for solving geospatial multi-objective optimization problem.}

abstract = {The present study proposes two mixed integer linear programming model for two important aspects of integrated production-distribution scheduling: order acceptance and batch direct delivery. Moreover, as many companies are unable to provide sufficient transportation facilities to deliver the customer orders due to high costs of initial investment, transportation is outsourced to a third-party logistics provider in which the transportation cost is dependent on the batch. The aim of this paper is trading off among the revenue of accepted orders, costs of delivery, and penalties for tardiness incurred in an integrated production-distribution in a supply chain to maximize the total of benefit. In addition, since the problem in this study is strongly NP-hard, an adaptive genetic algorithm is used to solve large-scale instances in this regard that use the adaptive search approach. A representation procedure is introduced based on two optimal properties of the problem. For the initial population, four heuristics are developed. To explore and locate the algorithm in a better neighborhood, a local search is made use of. Taguchi experimental design was applied to set the appropriate parameters of the algorithms. Moreover, to verify the developed model and evaluate the performance of algorithm against the exact solution, a commercial solver is used. The obtained results on generated random instances reveal the appropriate performance of heuristics, the adaptive approach and local search on the genetic algorithm. Furthermore, the effect of different parameters and factors of the proposed model on the profit shows that the order acceptance and the more vehicles of the company improve the profit.}

Here, defective production starts after the passage of some time from production commencement. Produced defective units are partially reworked and sold as fresh units. Under the environmental regulation, a cost (carbon tax) is charged by the government to mitigate global warming by reducing carbon emission (CE). Management also uses carbon trading when upper limit of carbon emission is given by the government. These costs bring a contradiction to a production manager. For more profit, if more production is decided, then CE and tax due to that are more. The models are formulated as single- and multi-objective profit maximization problems and solved using Rough age based single- and multi-objective Genetic Algorithms (RMOGAs). Numerical experiments are performed and graphical presentation of the results are depicted to illustrate the models. An algorithm with example for a firm management to achieve the maximum profit is also presented.}

This work investigates the use of the papiNet standard, originally designed for the forestry supply chain, as a possible data exchange format for a multi-fuel supply chain where forestry products are the dominant type of fuel. Two data models are described in this work: a data exchange model between different actors in the supply chain, and a data model for storing the required information. Furthermore, the application of the papiNet standard with these data models is explored. As a result, the papiNet standard is found to be suitable for use with some provisions.}

C-LIEGE is conceived as a showcase for good practices and a helping hand for European cities striving for cleaner and sustainable urban freight transport and logistics. C-LIEGE provides solutions for decision makers and professionals in Local Authorities and for freight operators. C-LIEGE empowers a cooperative approach between public and private stakeholders targeted on the reduction of energetic and environmental impacts of freight transport in European cities and regions. C-LIEGE successfully developed and tested freight transport demand-oriented measures and decision supporting tools towards reduction of energy, environmental and economic impacts of freight transport in urban environments. A set of integrated solutions and measures were implemented and tested by the support of newly developed C-LIEGE tools: the Stakeholder Engagement Manual, Good Practice Database, Push and Pull Measures Database, Guideline for the development of Urban Freight Mobility Plan as well as the C-LIEGE Toolbox for the establishment of a City Logistics Manager. Seven pilot experiments in six European countries assessed effectiveness of the C-LIEGE approach: Bulgaria, Italy, Poland, United Kingdom, Germany and Malta. The pilot cities selected and implemented a package of demand-oriented measures such as access fees and time windows restrictions, environmental zones, recognition schemes, freight maps, Freight Quality Partnerships, etc. A total of 35 demand-oriented measures were implemented in the C-LIEGE pilot cities, based upon the C-LIEGE toolbox and guidelines. The C-LIEGE pilot sites have introduced a wide range of measures aimed at reducing the impacts of urban freight transport: Fleet Operator Recognition Scheme (FORS) in Newcastle (UK), introduction of access restrictions for heavier freight vehicles in Montana (Bulgaria), new freight mapping in Leicester (UK) accessible via smart phone, re-routing measures in Stuttgart (Germany) as well as Hal-Tarxien (Malta), the establishment of Freight Quality Partnerships (FQPs) as well as Local Freight Development Plans (LFDPs) in all pilot cities. The results achieved in each C-LIEGE pilot site is summarized as follows: decreasing of CO, CO2, NOx and PM10 emissions (tons/year) generated by freight vehicles (Leicester: 15.3%; Newcastle: 9.5%; Stuttgart: 13.2%; Szczecin: 27.8%; Montana: 11.9%; Hal-Tarxien: 10.6%; Piacenza/Emilia-Romagna: 41.2%/44.4%), decreasing fossil fuel consumption (Leicester: 10.5%; Newcastle: 9.4%; Stuttgart: 13.1%; Szczecin: 27.8%; Montana: 11.9%; Hal-Tarxien: 10.5%; Piacenza/Emilia-Romagna: 1.7%/1.5%), decreasing operating costs for freight carriers (Leicester: 6.5% Newcastle: 5.4%; Stuttgart: 7.4%; Szczecin: 18.2%; Montana: 7.7%; Hal-Tarxien: 9.1%; Piacenza/Emilia-Romagna: 17.5%/20.1%). C-LIEGE finally filled the existing gap in know-how and professionalism in the sector by designing, fine-tuning and delivering the complimentary capabilities of City Logistics Manager. For the first time in Europe, the well-known Mobility Manager whose duties are focused on passenger transport only can be paired with a City Logistics Manager. We are convinced that the C-LIEGE tools and experiences will be of great value for urban freight transport management and logistics in other European cities and regions.}

So the aim of this paper is to develop efficient flexible long-term capacity planning policy for CLSCs that considers social responsibility or a supply chain with Reverse Logistics Social Responsibility (RLSR). This aim is to answer an important research question on how to tackle the lifecycle with its inherited uncertainty to achieve optimal sustainability dimensions performance. Here, a single-product System Dynamics (SD) model of the supply chain with RLSR is used. This SD model considers interrelated sustainability dimensions and adopts the product lifecycle with its inherited uncertainties, such as the length of the product lifecycle, pattern of the product lifecycle, and residence index. Finally, a mathematical model of the developed policy is constructed and a simplified non-linear multi-objective algorithm is proposed to solve this mathematical model. In addition, Taguchi Design is used to minimize the number of simulations needed in the numerical experiment. The findings of this study show that the developed policy could be used to tackle the lifecycle with its inherited uncertainty to optimize the sustainability dimensions performance. These findings have some limitations, however. The findings underscore this paper's contribution to the relatively limited but important academic knowledge on capacity planning development for research on social responsibility issues in CLSCs. In practice, the results will give managers a better understanding of how to tackle product lifecycle uncertainties in RLSR and will therefore lead to better capacity planning to achieve optimal sustainability dimensions performance.}

abstract = {Background and purpose
Clinical information logistics is a construct that aims to describe and explain various phenomena of information provision to drive clinical processes. It can be measured by the workflow composite score, an aggregated indicator of the degree of IT support in clinical processes. This study primarily aimed to investigate the yet unknown empirical patterns constituting this construct. The second goal was to derive a data-driven weighting scheme for the constituents of the workflow composite score and to contrast this scheme with a literature based, top-down procedure. This approach should finally test the validity and robustness of the workflow composite score.
Methods
Based on secondary data from 183 German hospitals, a tiered factor analytic approach (confirmatory and subsequent exploratory factor analysis) was pursued. A weighting scheme, which was based on factor loadings obtained in the analyses, was put into practice.
Results
We were able to identify five statistically significant factors of clinical information logistics that accounted for 63% of the overall variance. These factors were “flow of data and information”, “mobility”, “clinical decision support and patient safety”, “electronic patient record” and “integration and distribution”. The system of weights derived from the factor loadings resulted in values for the workflow composite score that differed only slightly from the score values that had been previously published based on a top-down approach.
Conclusion
Our findings give insight into the internal composition of clinical information logistics both in terms of factors and weights. They also allowed us to propose a coherent model of clinical information logistics from a technical perspective that joins empirical findings with theoretical knowledge. Despite the new scheme of weights applied to the calculation of the workflow composite score, the score behaved robustly, which is yet another hint of its validity and therefore its usefulness.}

abstract = {Logistic service providers are facing significant challenges in recent years due to intensified competition and ever-increasing customer expectations for cohesive high-standard services at low cost. To cope with these developments many companies aim for external growth to realize operational efficiencies and exploit productive opportunities of new markets and diversified services. Accordingly, 2015 has even become the most active year for mergers and acquisitions in logistic service industry. However, studies examining the post-merger performance effect and its determinants are scarce. Consequently, this paper takes up this issue by analysing a sample of 826 transaction announcements taken place between 1996 and 2015 and their performance effect in terms of short- and long-term abnormal shareholder returns. The results reveal, that although overall transactions exhibit significant positive abnormal returns, post-merger performance for the acquiring companies differs considerably according to the logistic services offered. In the short-term trucking, railway, 3PL and air cargo companies experience significant positive abnormal returns of about 0.6%–2.6%, while sea freight carriers realize only marginal effects and CEP companies do even not show any significant reaction. In the long-term, railway and 3PL companies realize a significant abnormal return of about 20%–24%, while trucking, sea freight and air cargo carriers do not exhibit significant returns and CEP companies do even experience significant losses of about −17%. Overall, diversifying transactions of established full-service providers outperform focus-increasing transactions of specialized operators.}

abstract = {Owing to the increasing interest in food quality in terms of freshness, a special type of logistics, called ubiquitous cold chain logistics (UCCL), has become an essential part of the distribution of environmentally sensitive items. UCCL aims to guarantee that delivery items are held under proper environmental conditions. By incorporating ubiquitous technologies such as radio frequency identification (RFID) tags and various types of sensors, monitoring and tracking environmental conditions for delivery items in UCCL have been easily achievable without latency. Nevertheless, addressing the complex nature of risk management rules caused by a large number of possible risk cases in UCCL has not yet been fully developed. Therefore, in this research, we suggest an intelligent risk management framework for UCCL, namely i-RM, which is designed to accommodate various types of risk situations by introducing the notion of context-aware real-time risk management. More specifically, i-RM takes a divide-and-combine approach where rules for risk management functions, context identification, risk detection, and response action judgment are defined in semantic ontologies. While rules for the risk management functions are defined independently of the others, they are dynamically linked for handling risks during run time. Moreover, i-RM is fully responsible for all of the risk management tasks required in UCCL, from information acquisition to responses in real time, by adopting event-based processing techniques. The effectiveness of the risk management ability of i-RM is demonstrated based on a real-world UCCL scenario.}

abstract = {In the last few decades, the rapid development of e-commerce technologies has encouraged many manufacturers to adopt an online channel in addition to their existing traditional retail channel, which resulted in redesigning their supply chain channel structure. Additionally, an increasing number of manufacturers nowadays offer a return policy to attract more customers and to stay competitive. This paper studies a supply chain system, which is comprised of production, refurbishing, collection, and waste disposal processes. A return policy in which customers can return the purchased item for a refund is also considered. Two selling strategies, a single-channel strategy (i.e., a retail channel) and a dual-channel (i.e., a retail channel and an online channel) strategy are discussed from which mathematical models are developed. The purpose is to examine the effect of different return policies on the behavior of SC systems before and after adopting the dual-channel. In both strategies, the paper analyzes the change in the profit, the pricing and inventory decisions. Numerical examples and sensitivity analyses are provided with their results discussed. The findings of this paper demonstrate that in both strategies, the more generous the return policy is, the higher the demand, the selling prices and the overall profit. The findings also indicate that adopting a dual-channel strategy is more profitable to the supply chain.}

We derive analytically the pricing and return product collection decisions for the supply chain under five different scenarios viz. centralized, decentralized (Nash game), and manufacturer-led, retailer-led and third party-led decentralized scenarios. We also demonstrate the proposed model through a series of data sets.

Developing a model, which can simultaneously consider these environmental, social, and economic aspects and their indicators, is an important problem for both researchers and practitioners. In this paper, we try to address this comprehensive approach by using indicators for measurement of aforementioned aspects and by applying fuzzy mathematical programming to design a multi-echelon multi-period multi-objective model for a sustainable reverse logistics network. To reflect all aspects of sustainability, we try to minimize the present value of costs, as well as environmental impacts, and optimize the social responsibility as objective functions of the model. In order to deal with uncertain parameters, fuzzy mathematical programming is used, and to obtain solutions on Pareto front, a customized multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm is applied. The validity of the proposed solution procedure has been analyzed in small and large size test problems based on four comparison metrics and computational time using analysis of variance. Finally, in order to indicate the applicability of the suggested model and the practicality of the proposed solution procedure, the model has been implemented in a medical syringe recycling system. The results reveal that the suggested MOPSO algorithm overtakes epsilon-constraint method from the aspects of quality of the solutions as well as computational time. Proper use of the proposed process could help managers efficiently manage the flow of recycled products with regard to environmental and social considerations, and the process offers a sustainable competitive advantage to corporations.}

Although many past space missions have been designed mainly from a mission-level perspective, a campaign-level perspective will be important for future space exploration. In order to find the optimal campaign-level space transportation architecture, a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation with a generalized multi-commodity flow and a time-expanded network is developed. Particularly, a new heuristics-based method, a partially static time-expanded network, is developed to provide a solution quickly. The developed method is applied to a case study containing human exploration of a near-Earth object (NEO) and Mars, related to the concept of the Flexible Path. The numerical results show that using the specific combinations of propulsion technologies, in-situ resource utilization (ISRU), and other space infrastructure elements can reduce the initial mass in low-Earth orbit (IMLEO) significantly. In addition, the case study results also show that we can achieve large IMLEO reduction by designing NEO and Mars missions together as a campaign compared with designing them separately owing to their common space infrastructure pre-deployment. This research will be an important step toward efficient and flexible campaign-level space mission planning.}

The simulation environment has been built based on a data set provided by the Terminal operator to reflect a real-world case. The simulation results show that the percent-improvement of the neural-net model׳s performance is 48% better than that of the best routing heuristic tested in previous studies. To test the applicability of the method with more complex logistic scenarios, we relaxed the sequence constraints for routing in a subsequent simulations study. If logistic complexity in terms of more freedom in decision-making is increased, the neural net model׳s percent-improvement performance of routing decisions is around three times better than the best-performing heuristic.}

We look at the business cases for different truck sizes, varying from small vans to large trucks, in relation to the logistics requirements. This contribution combines the relevant urban freight transport solution directions: technology (both for the vehicle and the supporting IT), logistics and policy. The attitudes of the different EFVs user groups are also taken into account. Only if all these elements support each other, a feasible case can be possible at this moment. We look at the current business case and make conclusions on where it is necessary to act in the near future in order to increase an uptake of electric freight vehicles. For this analysis we use the data collected from current demonstrations that are actually running in the European FP7 project FREVUE, which includes over 100 electric-powered vehicles in the cities of Amsterdam, Lisbon, London, Madrid, Milan, Oslo, Rotterdam, and Stockholm. This data includes operational, attitudinal and financial data for the before situation in which conventional vehicles were used and for the first year(s) where electric vehicles were operated.}

We consider a four-layer network comprised of manufacturers, retailers, customers, and logistics service providers (LSPs). In this problem, manufacturers, retailers, and LSPs do not collaborate or engage in any type of bargaining strategy among one other. Instead, they compete to supply products to customers at demand markets, while each agent seeks to maximize his own profit. LSPs compete among themselves to provide logistics (transportation/warehousing) services to manufacturers. It is considered that manufacturers, LSPs, and retailers collaborate to maximize services. Normally this problem cannot be modeled as an optimization problem, so we use a variational inequality approach to formulate it. To the best of our knowledge, this important problem, which helps evaluate options and make decisions when logistics activities are provided by LSPs, has not been modeled in the literature and this constitutes our main contribution. The model determines the optimal level of production for each manufacturer, the flow of products between manufacturers and retailers, the flow of products to be handled by each logistics service provider and the flow of products between retailers and demand markets in a non-cooperative environment. Numerous experiments are presented and adapted from test examples that are available in the literature, while results and important findings are discussed.}

Many different options have been proposed to lower emissions, and a critical one is the use of battery electric vehicles (BEVs). Since city-logistics accounts for about 25% of urban mobility emissions, we focus on battery electric and diesel delivery vans. The aim of this paper is to present a holistic view of the problem, comparing the environmental, social and economic impact of BEV and diesel delivery vans, providing useful insights to policy makers and fleet owners willing to replace or select delivery vans to include in their city-logistics fleets. In cities where new BEV vans replace old diesel vans and the electricity mix is relatively clean, CO2 emissions and air pollutants decrease by 93–98% and 85–99%, respectively. If BEVs use electricity coming from coal energy and are compared to new diesel vans, reductions of CO2 emissions and air pollutants are in the order of 12–13% and 0–92%, respectively. Longer battery life and greater annual mileage improve these results and decrease cost differences. Results also reveal that annual emissions benefits of replacing older diesel vans with BEVs are on the same order of magnitude of equivalent annual cost differences. From a strictly business perspective, BEV vans are already economically attractive in some cities with existing incentives; however, for other cities incentives equal to the value of their emissions reduction benefits are needed, but might not be sufficient to justify BEV acquisition.}

Therefore, a general two-stage quantitative framework that enables decision makers to select the optimal network design scheme for CLNs under uncertainty is proposed in this paper. Phase 1 calculates the simulation result of each hypothetical scenario of CLN resource combination using the expected value model with robust constraints.

In addition, we propose a new hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm based on genetic and imperialist competitive algorithms. We compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with a new lower bound method in terms of the CPU time and solution quality. Furthermore, we conclude that a considerable improvement in the reliability of the network can be achieved with only a slight increase in the total cost.

In this study, the KE approach is applied to derive ideas for the development of CBLS. For this purpose, Partial Least Squares (PLS) is used to analyze the relationships between the feelings of customers and service elements of CBLS. Moreover, this study demonstrates the applications of text mining techniques to analyze the online contents regarding CBLS. Online content mining assists in identifying the service elements and Kansei words for CBLS. Importantly, the relationship between the feelings of customers and service elements of CBLS obtained by online content mining provides complementary results for CBLS design. Relevance to industry: this study offers an exemplification on applying the integration of Kansei engineering and online content analysis to obtain ideas for the process Kansei design in service industry. Our findings imply that in addition to conventional customer survey, user generated online content analysis should be effective way of catching customer-oriented design elements; they provide complementary effects for Kansei design.}

This can be addressed by solving pickup and delivery problems with multiple time windows (PDPMTW) with paired demands, where vehicles have to transport loads from pickup locations to delivery locations while respecting capacity and time constraints. This paper presents an exact model to solve a PDPTW with soft period and hard time windows. The objective is to minimize the total cost including transportation and penalty costs. The obtained results are encouraging for such problems in an urban context.}

To deal with this challenge, an exact algorithm and a heuristic algorithm have been combined as the main approach to solving this problem. Owing to the importance that an exact algorithm holds with regard to enhancing emergency humanitarian logistical facility location problems, this paper aims to conduct a survey on the facility location problems that are related to emergency humanitarian logistics based on both data modeling types and problem types and to examine the pre- and post-disaster situations with respect to facility location, such as the location of distribution centers, warehouses, shelters, debris removal sites and medical centers. The survey will examine the four main problems highlighted in the literature review: deterministic facility location problems, dynamic facility location problems, stochastic facility location problems, and robust facility location problems. For each problem, facility location type, data modeling type, disaster type, decisions, objectives, constraints, and solution methods will be evaluated and real-world applications and case studies will then be presented. Finally, research gaps will be identified and be addressed in further research studies to develop more effective disaster relief operations.}

In regional and remote communities petroleum fuels are an essential commodity, particularly in post-disaster situations, given the supply chains of many other commodities are dependent on fuel supply. The aim of this study was to develop a framework and use it to analyse petroleum supply to communities affected by flooding across Queensland, Australia. The intent was to assist industry partners in identifying vulnerable localities and to development methods for application to other commodities. The approach focused on both the demand and supply side and used socio-spatial datasets, transport and commodity data. A multi-agent model was developed to represent the situation of petroleum fuel supply chain before and after a disaster event. The results identify both the broad sweep of vulnerable locations in key regions in Queensland as well as particular issues for communities in Cape York in far north Queensland. The approach proved viable, despite the limitations of publically available commodity datasets in Australia, and should therefore be of assistance to policy makers elsewhere seeking to identify system vulnerabilities and increase resilience.}

Optimization methodologies commonly utilized in the operations research area were employed for the analytical modeling of these two routing behaviors. The proposed methodologies were applied to apartment complexes in Seoul, Korea. It was found that the financial feasibility of CEP collaboration is guaranteed when the number of households in an apartment complex exceeds about 900. From the financial perspective, CEP collaboration is applicable to 9.1–19.4% of the apartment households in Seoul. In addition, CEP collaboration was analyzed to provide a meaningful amount of social cost savings, implying its economic feasibility.

Transportation has a critical share in HSCs and managing its risks helps to avoid further disruptions in relief operations. However, there is no common approach to or culture of risk management that its applicability has been studied through recent cases. This paper incorporates an empirical research design and makes a threefold contribution: first, it identifies in-country transportation risks during Nepal response. Second, we evaluate afore identified risks through an expert driven risk assessment grid. Third, we use our field data to study how some humanitarian organizations in Nepal response used logistics service providers for managing moderate- and high-level transportation risks. In this paper, we use both qualitative and quantitative methods. Our qualitative analysis reveals that some of the most important in-country transportation risks were delivery delays; market fluctuations; insufficient capacity; loss of cargo; cargo decay; unreliable information; and ethical concerns. Our quantitative work shows that while participants categorized the first three risks as high-level, the rest were ranked as moderate-level. More investigation in our field data indicates that using logistics service providers (LSPs) helped humanitarians significantly to manage afore in-country transportation risks during Nepal response. It also improved overall HSC performance with respect to flexibility, effectiveness, efficiency, and responsiveness. While this finding empirically confirms the “tools” role of LSPs for managing in-country transportation risks in response, it implies another role for LSPs; “contributors” to performance improvements.}

The integration of heterogeneous logistics systems with existing enterprise information systems is one of the most critical steps to achieve the intelligent infrastructure. Unfortunately, the integration is always a time-consuming process with heavy investment, which suppresses the longings of enterprises, especially for small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Aiming at simplifying the system integration, this paper proposed a cloud-based ubiquitous object sharing platform (CUOSP) to share the integration across SMEs based on the concept of sharing economy. CUOSP acts as a middleware system to make heterogeneous logistics systems universal plug-and-play (UPnP) for enterprise information systems. A kernel-based agent (KBA) is designed as the sharing entity of physical systems. It maintains the features of physical systems and is scalable for different application scenarios. A series of cloud gateway services are emerged not only to provide the basic running and sharing environment, but also to remedy KBA’s weaknesses in computing capacity. A prototype system is developed and implemented based on the framework of CUOSP and a laboratory case according to the consolidation scenario in E-commerce logistics is demonstrated. Comparison experiments are also conducted to explore the real-time and multitasking capacity of KBAs with different kernel characteristics and different computing resources.}

In this kind of supply chains the reverse flow of materials entering the system for recycling purposes complicates the way in which inventories should be managed and replenishment policies should be designed. Specifically, we analyse the relationships between some reverse logistics’ factors (remanufacturing lead-time, return rate of recycled products, reverse order policy, and number of supply chain tiers) on the order and inventory variance amplification. We firstly perform a systematic literature review of the related studies. Secondly, by adopting a difference equation math approach and design of experiment we perform a robust what-if analysis of a CLSC under a variety of operational and market conditions. Results show that, ceteris paribus, CLSC outperforms a forward supply chain, both in mono-echelon and multi-echelon structures and under both stationary and turbulent market demands. Furthermore, reducing remanufacturing lead-time and promoting information transparency may be crucial to improve CLSC dynamics. Finally, we use the research findings to provide interesting managerial consideration about how to reduce unnecessary operational members’ costs.}

Recycling, reuse, and re-processing of products are activities of RL networks, all of which are becoming increasingly prevalent due to growing environmental and socio-economic concerns. Research has begun to study such networks in an effort to maximize efficiency and to improve operations. Previous work focused on developing a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) with an aim of determining the optimal location and capacity of important nodes of the RL network, such as inspection centers and remanufacturing facilities. Transportation decisions, such as whether to use in-house or outsourced vehicles, are often based on cost effectiveness. The problem is formulated for the case of a household appliance in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region. Sixty-eight cities are considered, leading to a very large number of variables and constraints; thus, a heuristic approach, namely a Genetic Algorithm (GA), is chosen to solve the problem. The main contribution of this paper is to develop a very efficient GA capable of solving a large scale problem in short time. The developed GA was capable of solving a very large problem (with 656,885 continuous variables, 2040 binary variables, 10 integer variables, and 100,340 constraints) with a gap of 0.3% and about 38.5 times faster than GAMS using a personal computer. The same GA succeeded to solve both large and small problems to optimality or with a gap that didn’t exceed 1.5% and faster than GAMS. The technique that we used to code the GA reduced the number of variables and constraints to 92% and 86%, respectively. Furthermore, the reported results provide important insights on practical aspects of the problem, as well as useful points for the evaluation of the heuristic’s performance.}

Recently, the local government in Melbourne, Australia have relocated the fruit & vegetable wholesale market from a centrally located suburb: West Melbourne to Epping, a suburban area on the fringe of Greater Melbourne. This paper investigates the impacts of the market relocation on the freight activities for fruit and vegetable retailers and wholesalers that source fresh produce directly from the wholesale market. This study utilised a telephone questionnaire with retailers to identify their delivery schemes and evaluate the impact of the market relocation on their freight trips. The analysis of the responses indicated that the market relocation has led to a significant increase (31%) in distance travelled (VKT) by retailers compared with the former site in West Melbourne. It is estimated that this additional distance contributes 830 tonnes of CO2-e per year for all the freight trips by the retailers. Furthermore, nineteen fruit & vegetable wholesalers participated in the semi-structured interviews to evaluate the impacts of the market relocation on their freight activities with respect to additional vehicle-km and explore any changes to their freight trips. It is estimated that wholesalers have to drive on average an additional 14.1 km to distribute the fresh produce to their customers due to the market relocation. Analysis for the wholesalers revealed that the market relocation complicated their ability to sustain their customer base and geographical coverage due to the additional vehicle-km.}

While slow steaming is widely used as best practices for liner shipping companies, they are also under the pressure to maintain service level agreement (SLA) with their cargo clients. Thus, deciding optimal speed that minimizes fuel consumption while maintaining SLA is managerial decision problem. Studies in the literature use theoretical fuel consumption functions in their speed optimization models but these functions have limitations due to weather conditions in voyages. This paper uses weather archive data to estimate the real fuel consumption function for speed optimization problems. In particular, Copernicus data set is used as the source of big data and data mining technique is applied to identify the impact of weather conditions based on a given voyage route. Particle swarm optimization, a metaheuristic optimization method, is applied to find Pareto optimal solutions that minimize fuel consumption and maximize SLA. The usefulness of the proposed approach is verified through the real data obtained from a liner company and real world implications are discussed.}

First, various definitions and operations related to hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets (HFLTSs) and hesitant fuzzy linguistic sets (HFLSs) are discussed. Next, the definition of multi-hesitant linguistic term sets (MHFLTSs) is reviewed, which can eliminate the limitations associated with HFLTSs and HFLSs as well as emphasize the significance of repeated values. Then, a likelihood function is developed for multi-hesitant fuzzy linguistic term elements (MHFLTEs) based on a generalized function of the possibility degree of real numbers. Using this generalized function based on linguistic scale functions, alternatives that satisfy certain properties can be selected according to various semantic situations and the preferences of decision makers. Finally, the likelihood function of MHFLTEs is embedded into TODIM to address decision-making problems in which decision makers exhibit bounded rationality, and hesitance and repetitiveness exist in the linguistic evaluation information. According to the results of the illustrative examples and comparative analysis, the proposed approach can be used to effectively solve multi-criteria decision making problems involving the selection and evaluation of third-party logistics service providers.}

The research is motivated by the urgent need for designing a relief network in Tehran in preparation for potential earthquakes to cope with the main logistical problems in pre- and post-disaster phases. During the first stage, the locations for CWs and LDCs are determined along with the prepositioned inventory levels for the relief supplies. In this stage, inherent uncertainties in both supply and demand data as well as the availability level of the transportation network's routes after an earthquake are taken into account. In the second stage, a relief distribution plan is developed based on various disaster scenarios aiming to minimize: total distribution time, the maximum weighted distribution time for the critical items, total cost of unused inventories and weighted shortage cost of unmet demands. A tailored differential evolution (DE) algorithm is developed to find good enough feasible solutions within a reasonable CPU time. Computational results using real data reveal promising performance of the proposed SBPSP model in comparison with the existing relief network in Tehran. The paper contributes to the literature on optimization based design of relief networks under mixed possibilistic-stochastic uncertainty and supports informed decision making by local authorities in increasing resilience of urban areas to natural disasters.}

Among the most important emerging economies, Brazil, the largest Latin America economy, faces challenges such as a deficient logistics infrastructure and the recently enacted National Policy on solid waste. To bridge this gap, this paper identifies and evaluates the barriers for RL in the Brazilian context. An eleven-step research methodology is proposed. First, literature was thoroughly reviewed. fuzzy Delphi method (FDM) was used to obtain the critical list of barriers by experts and industrial managers’ opinions. Then, analytic hierarchy process (AHP) questionnaires were answered by electrical–electronic equipment (EEE) industry sector experts in order to obtain the priority ranking of barriers. This paper contributes with a compilation of the RL barriers from a systematic literature review process, a list of most common RL barriers accepted by Brazilian organizations, and a priority ranking of RL barriers for the electrical-electronic industry sector in Brazil. The “Economic related issues” category of barriers seems to be the first priority. The financial burden of tax and the uncertainty related to economic issues appear to be major obstacles for RL implementation.}

We propose a multiple assignment (MA) model for the joint design of the fleet size and the number, locations and capacities of hubs. The objective is to minimize the total costs, including congestion costs. We explicitly model the road congestion by formulating the route travel time as an increasing function of the number of trucks on the route. We consider two types of trucks to model economies of scale. Similar to a truck booking system, we control the node and road congestions by delaying some of the overfull demand at the origin nodes. We derive the asymptotic behavior as design variables increase and demonstrate how the 3PL system throughput is bounded by the bottleneck routes. When the existing road congestion on the bottleneck routes is heavy, excessively large fleets and hub capacities will worsen the traffic conditions and downgrade the system throughput. We develop a math-heuristic algorithm to solve our problem, which is decomposed into two subproblems. We prove that the two subproblems can be linearized. The numerical experiments reveal some interesting findings: (1) heavier congestion on an existing road network (without 3PL trucks) generates a design with higher requirements (a larger number of hubs, a larger hub capacity and a larger fleet size) and larger economies of scale; (2) neglecting the road congestion constraints optimistically estimates the system performance and generate a design with fewer hubs and a larger number of large trucks; and (3) decreasing the fixed costs of establishing hubs or the large truck-related costs can significantly increase the economies of scale and reduce the total number of trucks.}

abstract = {Logistic service providers are facing significant challenges in recent years due to intensified competition and ever-increasing customer expectations for cohesive high-standard services at low cost. To cope with these developments many companies aim for external growth to realize operational efficiencies and exploit productive opportunities of new markets and diversified services. Accordingly, 2015 has even become the most active year for mergers and acquisitions in logistic service industry. However, studies examining the post-merger performance effect and its determinants are scarce. Consequently, this paper takes up this issue by analysing a sample of 826 transaction announcements taken place between 1996 and 2015 and their performance effect in terms of short- and long-term abnormal shareholder returns. The results reveal, that although overall transactions exhibit significant positive abnormal returns, post-merger performance for the acquiring companies differs considerably according to the logistic services offered. In the short-term trucking, railway, 3PL and air cargo companies experience significant positive abnormal returns of about 0.6%–2.6%, while sea freight carriers realize only marginal effects and CEP companies do even not show any significant reaction. In the long-term, railway and 3PL companies realize a significant abnormal return of about 20%–24%, while trucking, sea freight and air cargo carriers do not exhibit significant returns and CEP companies do even experience significant losses of about −17%. Overall, diversifying transactions of established full-service providers outperform focus-increasing transactions of specialized operators.}

We address the tactical-planning problem of determining the quantity of capacity units, hereafter called bins, of different types to secure for the next period of activity, given the uncertainty on future needs in terms of demand for loads (items) to be moved or stored, and the availability and costs of capacity for these movements or storage activities. We propose a modeling framework introducing a new class of bin packing problems, the Stochastic Variable Cost and Size Bin Packing Problem. The resulting two-stage stochastic formulation with recourse assigns to the first stage the tactical capacity-planning decisions of selecting bins, while the second stage models the subsequent adjustments to the plan, securing extra bins and packing the items into the selected bins, performed each time the plan is applied and new information becomes known. We propose a new meta-heuristic based on progressive hedging ideas that includes advanced strategies to accelerate the search and efficiently address the symmetry strongly present in the problem considered due to the presence of several equivalent bins of each type. Extensive computational results for a large set of instances support the claim of validity for the model, efficiency for the solution method proposed, and quality and robustness for the solutions obtained. The method is also used to explore the impact on the capacity plan and the recourse to spot-market capacity of a quite wide range of variations in the uncertain parameters and the economic environment of the firm.}

abstract = {Flexibility in combination with high capacities are the main reasons for milkruns being one of the most popular intralogistics solutions. In most cases they are only used for static routes to always deliver the same material to the same stations. However, in the context of Industry 4.0, milkrun logistic also has become very popular for use cases where different materials have to be delivered to different stations in little time, so routes cannot be planned in advance anymore. As loading and unloading the milkrun requires a significant amount of time, beside the routing problem itself, both driving and loading times have to be taken into account. Especially in scenarios where high flexibility is required those times will vary significantly and thus are a crucial factor for obtaining the optimal solution. Although containing stochastic components, those times can be predicted by considering the optimal point of time for delivery. In consequence, the best tradeoff between short routes and optimal delivery times is in favor of the shortest route. To solve this optimization problem a biology-inspired method – the ant colony optimization algorithm – has been enhanced to obtain the best solution regarding the above-mentioned aspects. A manufacturing scenario was used to prove the ability of the algorithm in real world problems. It also demonstrates the ability to adapt to changes in manufacturing systems very quickly by dynamically modelling and simulating the processes in intralogistics. The paper describes the ant colony optimization algorithm with the necessary extensions to enable it for milkrun logistic problems. Additionally the implemented software environment to apply the algorithm in practice is explained.}

Companies implementing lean practices have experienced improvements in cost, quality, and demand responsiveness. Nonetheless certain transportation and distribution practices may have detrimental impact on the environment. This study asks: What impact do current best practices in lean logistics have on the environment? The research hypotheses propose that since just-in-time inventory management significantly increases the frequency of transport it will also increase greenhouse gas emissions in a supply chain. Conversely, product postponement and vendor-managed inventory practices decrease supply chain emissions because they improve the flexibility of the system to manage uncertainty in supply and demand and thus reduce transportation-related emissions while only increasing facility-related emissions, which are relatively smaller. The hypotheses are tested using a simulation model of a manufacturing-retailer supply chain. The research hypotheses are empirically supported, suggesting that business process improvements need to consider when operational changes can have the unintended consequence of significantly increasing emission-intensive transactions.}

Diverse environmental, health and economic problems are especially in urban agglomerations of working; living and supply reason enough for implementing a sustainable infrastructure in urban logistics. This paper aims to offer an understanding of technology equally operating with humans in actor networks, which influences our behaviour. So to change our behaviour, we have to start changing our interaction models with technology and offer attractive conditions for more sustainable uses. Thus, the diffusion of an innovation won’t be the question anymore, but the translation of lifestyles into actor networks, like sustainable structures for intermodal interchanges.

A new arc-and-route-based mathematical model is constructed to formulate the problem in which the sum of drivers’ wage, fuel cost, and handling cost is minimized. A matheuristic based on variable neighborhood search (VNS) and integer programming is designed to solve the 2E-CVRP-E. The integer programming in the matheuristic is used as a post-optimization technique to find better solutions missed by the VNS algorithm or to construct the least-cost first-level routes. To validate its effectiveness, the matheuristic first performs tests on 2E-CVRP instances and improves 13 current best-known solutions out of 234 instances. Then it performs tests on the 2E-CVRP-E instances modified from the 2E-CVRP. For 2E-CVRP-E instances, the total cost of the best solution found by the matheuristic is smaller than that of the best-known 2E-CVRP solution with an average relative gap of 6.37%. Computational results prove that the proposed matheuristic can find high-quality solutions for the 2E-CVRP and the 2E-CVRP-E.}

Social media has revolutionized our societies. It has made fundamental impact on the way we work and live. More importantly, social media is gradually becoming a key pulse of smart societies by sensing the information about the people and their spatio-temporal experiences around the living spaces. Big data and computational intelligence technologies are helping us to manage and analyze large amounts of data generated by the social media, such as twitter, and make informed decisions about us and the living spaces. This paper reports our preliminary work on the use of social media for the detection of spatio-temporal events related to logistics and planning. Specifically, we use big data and AI platforms including Hadoop, Spark, and Tableau, to study twitter data about London. Moreover, we use the Google Maps Geocoding API to locate the tweeters and make additional analysis. We find and locate congestion around the London city. We also discover that, during a certain period, top third tweeted words were about job and hiring, leading us to locate the source of the tweets which happened to be originating from around the Canary Wharf area, UK's major financial center.

Addressing RL outsourcing problems has become increasingly relevant issue in the management science and decision making literatures. The correct evaluation and ranking of the decision criteria/priorities determining the selection of the best third-party RL providers (3PRLPs) is essential for the competitive performance of the outsourcing company. The method proposed in this study allows to identify and classify these decision criteria. First, the relevant criteria and sub-criteria are identified using a SWOT analysis. Then, Intuitionistic Fuzzy AHP is used to evaluate the relative importance weights among the criteria and the corresponding sub-criteria. These relative weights are implemented in a novel extension of Mikhailov's fuzzy preference programming method to produce local weights for all criteria and sub-criteria. Finally, these local weights are used to assign a global weight to each sub-criterion and create a ranking. We discuss the results obtained by applying the proposed model to a case study of a real company. In particular, these results show that the most important priority for the company when delegating RL activities to 3PRLPs is to focus on the core business, while reducing costs constitutes one of its least important priorities.}

With Singapore's mild restrictions on the vehicle types or the time windows for the last-mile delivery, we believe that with proper technology in place, an Urban Consolidation Center like the Tenjin Joint Distribution System in Fukuoka Japan may be implemented to achieve cost reduction with some degree of privacy preservation. Participating carriers keep their respective private orders and have the option to get their remaining shareable orders consolidated with those from the other carriers’ fleet. To this end, we propose in this paper a double auction mechanism that enables such consolidation with an objective to maximize the total cost savings attained by all participating carriers. Our experimental results on 5 zones of delivery in Singapore CBD demonstrate that the proposed double auction is able to bring about reductions in the number of inter-zone travels, thereby producing cost savings to the participating carriers.}

Reverse logistics (RL) has been considered as a systematic approach for industries to improve their environmental impacts and to ensure sustainability in business. Industries are enthusiastic to adopt RL activities in their businesses, but they also face challenges such as insufficient knowledge and resources regarding RL implementation. Therefore, we seek to evaluate the critical success factors (CSFs) linked to the implementation of RL in manufacturing industries in India. In this work, a structural model is proposed by using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) methods to evaluate the CSFs in RL adoption. The AHP methodology assists in establishing the priorities of the CSFs, while the DEMATEL approach categorizes the causal relationships among them. The findings of this work shows that the Global competitiveness main factor is highly prioritized, and thus, needs to be focused greatly in order to increase the effectiveness of RL adoption in business. The relative priority of the remaining main factors through AHP analysis is given as Regulatory factors - HR and organizational factors -Economic factors - Strategic factors. The findings also indicate that Global competitiveness; Regulatory; HR and organizational main factors are classified under cause group, while Economic and Strategic main factors belong to effect group. This model will help business analysts and supply chain managers formulate both short-term and long-term, flexible decision strategies for successfully managing and implementing RL adoption in the supply chain scenarios.}

To motivate 3PL providers to invest in developing their IT capabilities and, thus, reduce the “IT gap,” we analyze a 3PL provider's IT investment, as well as its impact on supply chain profit, under four logistics outsourcing contract structures: a fixed-price contract, a contract contingent on the on-time delivery rate, a profit-sharing contract, and a revenue-sharing contract. We find that the 3PL provider's IT investment is higher under the contingent and profit-sharing contract structures than it is under the other two contract structures. The 3PL provider's IT investment under the contingent contract is no more than that of the profit-sharing contract. Additionally, we find that the contingent and profit-sharing contracts result in a higher profit within the supply chain than the other two contract structures do, and that the supply chain profits under contingent and profit-sharing contracts are dependent on the 3PL provider's IT investment. The results provide 3PL buyers and providers guidance in terms of using contract structures to motivate IT investment in logistics outsourcing.}

abstract = {The coordination among the different actors in relief chains is crucial to provide effective and efficient response in emergency logistics. By recognizing this fact, we have developed two stochastic mixed-integer programming models to integrate and coordinate facility location, transportation and fleet sizing decisions in a multi-period, multi-commodity, and multi-modal context under uncertainty. One model even considers the option of reusing vehicles to cover extra routes within the same time period in an attempt to save overall resources and improve service levels. Typical uncertainty in victims׳ needs, incoming supply, inventory conditions, and roads availability are modeled through a set of scenarios representing plausible disaster impacts. To solve instances of practical size, we have devised relax-and-fix and fix-and-optimize heuristics based on decompositions by time, scenario, and stage. The proposed instances entail characteristics of the megadisaster in the Mountain Region of Rio de Janeiro State in Brazil. The results suggest that the integration of decisions in a multiperiod context and the option of reusing vehicles reduce total costs, thus improving the overall performance of the relief operations. Also, the time-decomposition fix-and-optimize heuristic outperforms the CPLEX solver in terms of elapsed times and optimality gaps, mainly in moderate-size instances. Finally, we show the importance to explicitly consider randomness instead of using simpler worst-case scenario approaches.}

abstract = {Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is applied widely in food cold chain logistics. However, traditional monitoring systems require significant real-time sensor data transmission which will result in heavy data traffic and communication systems overloading, and thus reduce the data collection and transmission efficiency. This research aims to develop a temperature Monitoring System for Frozen and Chilled Aquatic Products (MS-FCAP) based on WSN integrated with Compressed Sending (CS) to improve the efficiency of MS-FCAP. Through understanding the temperature and related information requirements of frozen and chilled aquatic products cold chain logistics, this paper illustrates the design of the CS model which consists of sparse sampling and data reconstruction, and shelf-life prediction. The system was implemented and evaluated in cold chain logistics between Hainan and Beijing in China. The evaluation result suggests that MS-FCAP has a high accuracy in reconstructing temperature data under variable temperature condition as well as under constant temperature condition. The result shows that MS-FCAP is capable of recovering the sampled sensor data accurately and efficiently, reflecting the real-time temperature change in the refrigerated truck during cold chain logistics, and providing effective decision support traceability for quality and safety assurance of frozen and chilled aquatic products.}

Through a multiple case study analysis, this paper explores the environmental strategies of a sample of medium-sized 3PLs operating in Italy and the UK, in terms of environmental organizational culture, initiatives, and influencing factors. Our analysis shows that, notwithstanding environmental sustainability is generally recognised as a strategic priority, a certain degree of diversity in the deployment of environmental strategies still exists. This paper is original since the extant literature on green strategies of 3PLs provides findings predominantly from a single country perspective and mainly investigates large/multinational organizations. It also provides indications to help managers of medium-sized 3PLs in positioning their business. This is particularly meaningful in the 3PL industry, where medium-sized organizations significantly contribute to the generated turnover and market value.}

Among those various applications, we focus herein on the use of UAVs in delivery logistics. The UAV logistics system has some fundamental characteristics that distinguish it from the usual ground logistics such as limited flight time, loadable capacity, effect of cargo weight on flight ability, and others. To handle the above issues, we propose a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation for derivation of persistent UAV delivery schedules. To address the computational issues, a Receding Horizon Task Assignment (RHTA) heuristic is developed and tested with numerical examples for island-area delivery.}

In a closed-loop supply chain, production planning is influenced by uncertainty not only from customers’ demand, but also from collectors due to difficulties in the reverse logistics flow. Therefore, it is important to develop a robust closed-loop supply chain model to respond to uncertainty from reverse logistics. In this study, we develop a deterministic mixed-integer optimization model and robust counterparts to cope with the uncertainty of recycled products and customer demand in the fashion industry. We show that a robust counterpart with a budget of uncertainty is equivalent to a robust counterpart with a box uncertainty under special conditions. To avoid the conservatism of a robust solution, an alternative optimization problem is developed to take advantage of the budget of uncertainty. To verify the performance of the proposed model, numerical experiments are conducted. The simulation results show the proposed model responds robustly to uncertainty and is superior to a deterministic model and other robust counterparts.}

Moreover, analysis indicates that the 3PLs need to improve internal processes related to quality management, flexibility of its operations and also geographical coverage of their services.}

A multi-step approach is proposed. In the first step, we identify collaboration partner evaluation criteria using BOCR framework. In the second step, linguistic assessment of criteria and alternatives (collaboration partners) is performed by a decision making committee. The linguistic data is treated via fuzzy triangular numbers for analytical processing. In the third step, alternatives are ranked using Gray Relational Analysis technique (GRA) and five BOCR scoring methods. The different alternative ranks are subject to veto and the alternative(s) with highest top ranks are considered for sensitivity analysis whereby we analyze the influence of changes in criteria weights and scoring methods on their ranks. If the rankings remain unchanged, then the veto retained alternative(s) are declared as winner(s) and recommended for collaboration. A numerical application is provided. This is one of the first works to address the collaboration partner selection problem in the context of city logistics under limited or lack of quantitative data. A comprehensive set of criteria are proposed and the best solution is generated using veto role on various scores obtained from BOCR and fuzzy GRA, thereby eliminating any bias arising from method selection.}
