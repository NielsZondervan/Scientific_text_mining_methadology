abstract = {The container shipping industry faces many interrelated challenges and opportunities, as its role in the global trading system has become increasingly important over the last decades. On the one side, collaboration between port terminals and shipping liners can lead to costs savings and help achieve a sustainable supply chain, and on the other side, the optimization of operations and sailing times leads to reductions in bunker consumption and, thus, to fuel cost and air emissions reductions. To that effect, there is an increasing need to address the integration opportunities and environmental issues related to container shipping through optimization. This paper focuses on the well known Berth Allocation Problem (BAP), an optimization problem assigning berthing times and positions to vessels in container terminals. We introduce a novel mathematical formulation that extends the classical BAP to cover multiple ports in a shipping network under the assumption of strong cooperation between shipping lines and terminals. Speed is optimized on all sailing legs between ports, demonstrating the effect of speed optimization in reducing the total time of the operation, as well as total fuel consumption and emissions. Furthermore, the model implementation shows that an accurate speed discretization can result in far better economic and environmental results.}

The paper classifies the various modalities of FDM, and summarizes the real-life experiences of their implementation. To illustrate the potential of FDM, the paper analyzes Receiver-Led Consolidation (RLC) programs. The paper provides background on consolidation programs, and estimates a behavioral model to shed light on the factors explaining receivers’ interest in cargo consolidation. The resulting model is used to estimate expected participation in a RLC program in New York City. These results are complemented with freight-trip generation analyses, and a behavioral micro-simulation to estimate potential reductions in freight traffic and vehicle-miles-traveled. The results show that RLC programs could bring significant benefits to large metropolitan areas, reducing freight vehicle-miles-traveled and congestion levels.}

Biorefineries sited near large amounts of forest residue can better mitigate against the risk of reduced feedstock availability due to exogenous market constraints. Two methodologies for estimating the volume and cost of delivered forest residues to a biorefinery are presented. Both methodologies are based on data provided by the U.S. Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program. The first methodology is past-predictive in that it uses individual state Timber Product Output (TPO) datasets, while the second methodology is future-predictive in that it uses a spatially explicit economic optimization model of the U.S. forestry sector coupled with stand data at FIA plot locations to project near- and medium-term residue volumes. A Total Delivered Feedstock Cost Model is used with both biomass estimation methods to enable comparison of facility supply curves. A case study assesses four pulp mills, considered as candidate repurposed biorefinery locations, for their ability to procure sufficient biomass under average- and low-yield scenarios utilizing both methods. The facility that procures sufficient feedstock to meet annual biorefinery demand at the least cost under both yield scenarios theoretically provides the least risk to investors in terms of insufficient feedstock availability. The past-predictive methodology was found to be best-suited for refining a list of candidate facilities for further analysis. The future-predictive methodology is best-suited for a robust analysis of facilities using multiple economic and policy scenarios.}

Typically, the formal channel consists of recyclers with official qualifications for disassembling WEEE while the informal channel is dominated by unregulated recyclers. We develop a quality-based price competition model for the WEEE recycling market in a dual channel environment comprising both formal and informal sectors. The equilibrium acquisition prices and effects of government subsidy in the two channels are examined under four competitive scenarios. While government subsidy can support the formal sector, our analysis shows that at a higher quality level of waste, the marginal effect of subsidy is not as promising. When the quality of waste is high but the government subsidy is not substantial, the informal sector always has a competitive advantage. To promote the healthy development of the recycling industry the government should adjust the subsidy appropriately to limit the quality of waste at a high level suitable only for refurbishing in the informal sector. Our study also shows that both the formal and informal channels prefer high quality products. However, the informal recycler always has a better acquisition price to capture a bigger market share of used products than the formal recycler at the quality level of refurbishing for both recyclers. In a quality-pricing environment, as quality increases the acquisition prices in the two channels may crossover. This indicates that neither of the two channels always have a clear price advantage at all quality levels. We will not be able to obtain this result in a uniform pricing model. As such product quality is an important factor to consider in a competitive recycling market.}

abstract = {Airlines typically carry out freight transportation in a hub and spoke structure, where the movements between the outstations and the hub are served by trucks. To transport freight efficiently, air carriers must consider bundling options for shipments that are delivered at outstations and have to be moved to the hub. There are three options when it comes to bundling freight: on ‘through unit load devices’ (T-ULD) (all freight for the same flight at the hub), on ‘mixed unit load devices’ (M-ULD) (freight for different flights at the hub) and loose freight in trucks. The optimal freight bundling configuration for carriers, taking into account their main KPIs (key performance indicators), is unknown. This research formulates the problem as a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem, allowing carriers to decide which configuration is optimal for a given outstation. The selected KPIs (cost, (un)loading time, and quality) are formulated as mathematical functions. A new MCDM, called best worst method (BWM), is then used to identify the best configuration with respect to the three KPIs. The proposed methodology is applied to KLM Cargo to identify the best configuration for the selected outstations that supply freight to the KLM hub at Schiphol Airport. This case study shows that there are different optimal freight bundling configurations for different outstations and that trucking costs and freight handling tariffs are among the key factors in deciding which configuration is optimal.}

In the block stacking method, blocks can be stored on top of each other in order to utilise the limited surface of a storage area. When there is a predetermined pickup order among the blocks, this stacking method inevitably leads to the reshuffling moves for blocks stored above the target block and the minimisation of such unproductive reshuffling moves is of a primary concern to industry practitioners. A container terminal is a typical place where this problem arises, thus the problem being also referred to as the container relocation problem. In this study, we consider departure time windows for containers, which are usually revealed by the truck appointment system in port container terminals. We propose a stochastic dynamic programming model to calculate the minimum expected number of reshuffles for a stack of containers which all have departure time windows. The model is solved with a search-based algorithm in a tree search space, and an abstraction heuristic is proposed to improve the time performance. To overcome the computational limitation of exact methods, we develop a heuristic called the expected reshuffling index (ERI) and evaluate its performance.}

The work concentrates on urban areas where public policies aiming at improving the sustainability of city systems necessarily affect both passengers and freight dimensions. Traffic in towns is responsible for a high share of congestion and pollution and consequently, it contributes to the climate change problems. The following conclusions can be derived. ABMs present important advantages for analysing urban transport and its sustainability but more efforts are needed in order to test and improve their use. In the literature, there is still a gap in urban transport AB modelling. The number of developed models is limited and they are often applied in broader geographical areas than urban ones. Only some of the works includes the estimation of environmental impacts as a result of certain types of agents' behaviour. Despite their potential effectiveness to represent the impacts of different public policies on agent behaviour and on the environment, none of the ABMs have been implemented in the real word by the researchers and there is no evidence of application of any model by policy-makers.}

Different from the conventional model, our model is aimed at partitioning an entire service area into multiple service regions or clusters of customers. Each service region is served by a single vehicle. Once service regions are determined, vehicle routes within service regions can be adjusted from day to day in response to the changing traffic condition. We develop a scenario-based algorithm in which an index of “intimacy degree” is defined for grouping customers into different clusters. Two local search heuristics are constructed based on the index of “intimacy degree” to search the optimal solution. The results of our model would allow the decision makers to assess the trade-off among the number of vehicles used, the total travel cost, and the penalties incurred due to unserved customers and unbalanced workloads of drivers. Experiments are conducted to compare the performance of our algorithm with two other algorithms. The results indicate that our algorithm consistently outperforms the other two algorithms in terms of solution quality.}

The main motivation is to test hypothesized relations between urban freight delivery parking issues and the aforementioned factors as a way to perform an indirect, but informative, freight infrastructure adequacy assessment. The hypothesized model structure makes it possible to examine, for example, if the distribution channel characteristics (e.g., the most frequently used delivery vehicle type) can be linked to a certain type of parking behavior/preference, due to operation requirements, which could result in perceived urban freight delivery parking issues. The chosen variables are assembled from a plethora of sources. Establishment characteristics include size, number of employees and weekly deliveries, with this data being gathered using an establishment-based freight survey. Distribution channels are characterized by the predominant delivery agent and vehicle type. Delivery operations are represented by the most common parking location. Finally, the perceived issues include vehicles blocking other vehicles, lack of loading/unloading bays and illegal parking in loading/unloading bays. The land use data is obtained from parking records, the OpenStreetMap repository, the Portuguese National Statistics Institute (e.g., information on residents) and the City Council’s retail establishments’ census. The results show that, in general, the hypothesized relationships hold true. Perceived urban freight delivery parking issues are a function of the establishment characteristics, their distribution channels and delivery operations patterns. Weekly deliveries are dependent on distribution channels and establishment characteristics. Finally, weekly deliveries’ frequency did not seem to influence the perceived urban freight delivery parking issues. This supports the hypothesis that the retailers’ judgement is not biased by the frequency of said operations.}

abstract = {We focus on optimization models involving individual chance constraints, in which only the right-hand side vector is random with a finite distribution. A recently introduced class of such models treats the reliability levels / risk tolerances associated with the chance constraints as decision variables and trades off the actual cost / return against the cost of the selected reliability levels in the objective function. Leveraging recent methodological advances for modeling and solving chance-constrained linear programs with fixed reliability levels, we develop strong mixed-integer programming formulations for this new variant with variable reliability levels. In addition, we introduce an alternate cost function type associated with the risk tolerances which requires capturing the value-at-risk (VaR) associated with a variable reliability level. We accomplish this task via a new integer linear programming representation of VaR. Our computational study illustrates the effectiveness of our mathematical programming formulations. We also apply the proposed modeling approach to a new stochastic last mile relief network design problem and provide numerical results for a case study based on the real-world data from the 2011 Van earthquake in Turkey.}

In this paper, attention is drawn to reduce the environmental risk derived from facility location, inventory level and multi-depot vehicle-routing of explosive waste management. Unlike other works in the literature, the risk is assessed as the impact volume associated with certain hazard radii posed by the explosions happening en route and at site. An optimization model minimizing total cost and risk is developed to simultaneously decide 1) where to locate the collection centers, 2) how to manage the inventory level for each center, 3) how many vehicles need to be purchased; 4) how to route explosive wastes from generation nodes to collection centers, and 5) how to route explosive wastes from collection centers to recycling centers. A solution procedure on the basis of the TOPSIS method is proposed to solve the optimization model within reasonable computation time. Lastly, the application of the developed approach in Nanchuan of Southwest China and a wide range of numerical experiments are conducted. The results show significant improvement in both system cost (34%) and environmental risk (57%).}

Technological solutions called “smart wells” and “smart fields” have been applied in petroleum industry for nearly two decades.

Researchers and companies in pursuit of their goals tend to use one-sided implications and numerous synonyms when describing the substance of the term, which leads to an occasional confusion. In order to study the concept of smart field from a general perspective, a literature review has been conducted, and main characteristic attributes of such solutions have been revealed. Selected marketed products offered by engineering companies have been analyzed as examples of the technology implementation. A definition has been proposed along with its practical implications. Additionally, an attempt has been made to place these solutions in a broad scientific context of intelligence and sustainability in contemporary business processes.}

Field survey and economic analysis are employed as the main research methods. The problems of straw collection, storage, and transportation are examined. According to the data obtained from the investigation and the mathematical model, when the straw recycling company uses the artificial model, the average price of each ton of straw is 385.4 yuan; when the straw recycling company uses the mechanical model, the average price of each ton of straw is 264.4 yuan. Comparison of the mechanical and artificial models reveals that the average price of each ton of straw differs by 121 yuan. Under the assumption that the annual purchase amount of straw is 2 × 105 tons, the cost of 2.42 × 107 yuan per year can be saved. Thus, Laifa Straw Recycling Company of Henan Sheqi should consider the mechanical model. Sensitivity analysis of the two models shows that the collection cost is the most sensitive factor when the straw recycling company utilizes the artificial model because most farmers go out to work, so a shortage in rural labor force occurs; this shortage results in increased cost of artificial collection. When the straw recycling company utilizes the mechanical model, the cost of storage is the most sensitive factor because of the large storage amount. High current land leasing and management costs lead to increased storage cost.}

However, limited research focuses on the context of humanitarian supply chains. This calls to develop structural models that can scrutinize the technology adoption behaviour of the users in the humanitarian context. Therefore, this study is an attempt to empirically examine the technology adoption behaviour of humanitarian organizations. It extends the unified theory of the acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model by integrating personal innovativeness and trust in technology with the behavioural intention to adopt technology in the humanitarian context. Data from 192 humanitarian practitioners, who have experienced a large number of disasters, is utilized to empirically validate the conceptual model. The structural equation modelling results show that - out of four constructs namely performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and facilitating conditions under UTAUT - performance expectancy and effort expectancy significantly affect the IT adoption. Contrary to expectations, trust and personal innovation do not affect the behavioural intention. Also, personal innovation does not moderate the relationship between performance expectancy and effort expectancy. This underlines the need to foster a learning culture within these organizations. The efforts made by involved humanitarian organizations may be directed towards improving the level of education, skills and facilitating them with other resources such as appropriate IT and data mining training, so that the technology adoption becomes an integral part of their daily activities. Finally, detailed implications for humanitarian organizations are discussed.}

This paper provides a mass-evacuation strategy using public transportation before the strike of a hurricane. The assumptions made are that the evacuation zones, shelter locations, and the time of strike of the hurricane are pre-determined. The evacuation operations commence when the warnings are issued and end when the hurricane strike is predicted to occur. We propose a multi-stage approach. At the first stage is the planning framework, where pickup locations are determined and assigned to shelters, and an initial set of routes is generated along these locations. This is done by weighing each location based on the accumulated demand, and favoring multiple routes to pass through a location with higher demand. In the next stage, each route is assigned a trip number such that 1) routes with higher demand require more trips, and 2) two successive trips to a route are spaced evenly. A simulation tool has been developed to model the dispatching of the given number of buses, stochastic arrival of evacuees, queueing effects at the pickup locations, and the transportation of evacuees to the safety regions. The results from the simulation presented in this paper serve as an evaluation tool for a route design, and a local search heuristic is proposed to effect positive changes in the route design.}

Outcome-based contracting concepts are being used for PSS acquisitions in healthcare, energy, military systems and infrastructure. These contracts allow customers to pay only for the specific outcomes achieved (e.g., availability) rather than the workmanship and materials delivered. Given the rise in interest in outcome-based contracts, it is incumbent upon the through-life engineering services (TES) community to determine how to design systems (including designing the sustainment of systems) to operate under these contract mechanisms, and to ultimately coordinate the system design with the design of the contract terms. Furthermore, sustainment decisions made under outcome-based contracts must target the optimum action for the population of systems managed under the contract, rather than the optimum action for an individual system. Today, outcome-based contract design is always performed separate from the engineering and TES design processes, and provided as a requirement to the design process, an approach that creates significant risks for all parties. For systems managed under outcome-based contracts, contract failure may mean significant money is spent by the customer (potentially the public) for either no outcome or inadequate outcome, or result in the contractor being driven out of business, which can lead to disaster for both parties.}

The not-for-profit food rescue organizations, aid in alleviating hunger, by rescuing the surplus food from different food providers and re-distributing to people in need. However, surplus food donation is a random process which varies with regard to quantity, time and place. Understanding the dynamics of food recovery and forecasting food donations using historical information has significant importance in inventory management and redistribution, particularly in reducing operational costs and achieving a sustainable and equitable distribution of inventory incorporating uncertainties in supply. This paper uses different modelling techniques including multiple linear regression, structural equation modelling and neural networks to explore the patterns and dynamics of food donation and distribution process for one of the largest food rescue organization in Australia. A set of significant indicators has been identified to describe the current food donation process, to predict daily average food donated by different food providers and also to anticipate the potential donation from a new donor which may appear in the network in the future. Results suggest that structural equation modelling and neural networks provide improved demand estimation when compared to conventional multiple linear regression. We also discuss the usefulness of these models in sustainable and equitable management of food recovery and redistribution.}

Besides, additional costs for repeated deliveries can occur. The paper begins focusing on demographic and socio-economic factors that mainly influence end-consumer purchase production and subsequent trips. Then, a new system of models for simulating shopping choices, including e-shopping, is presented. The models were obtained by using surveys carried out in Rome where about 800 households were interviewed. The system of models were used to assess the effects on shopping and goods delivering under future demographic and socio-economic changes in an urban area.

Two methodologies are used to determine truckers’ spot price in the freight transport process, which are the artificial neural network and quantile regression, and a price forecasting framework is created. The framework is applied to two approaches: a route-based model and a general model in which all routes are considered together.

The plant contracts a fleet of harvesting crews, which must be assigned by the plant scheduler to harvest fields as they are called in by the farmers over the harvest season. First, we study the static CSHSP, in which the call in times for the fields are assumed known at the beginning of the season, and propose a mathematical programming-based approach that we show to generate solutions with an average optimality gap of only 6.1% for real-life-inspired instances. We also consider the dynamic CSHSP, in which the call in times are not known at the beginning of the harvest season and the requests arrive randomly over time. The method that we develop for the solution of this problem incurs costs that are about 4.8% higher, on average, than those incurred for the static case. These results exhibit the proposed approach to be robust for use by a plant scheduler in his/her efforts to optimize harvest scheduling as the actual season unfolds. Our proposed approach can also effectively deal with uncertainties encountered in a commercial harvest.}

However, practically, the uncertainty in travel times and customer demand often means vehicles miss these time windows, increasing service costs and decreasing customer satisfaction. In an effort to find a solution that meets the needs of real-world logistics, we examine the vehicle routing problem with hard time windows under demand and travel time uncertainty. To address the problem, we build a robust optimization model based on novel route-dependent uncertainty sets. However, due to the complex nature of the problem, the robust model is only able to tackle small-sized instances using standard solvers. Therefore, to tackle large instances, we design a two-stage algorithm based on a modified adaptive variable neighborhood search heuristic. The first stage of the algorithm minimizes the total number of vehicle routes, while the second stage minimizes the total travel distance. Extensive computational experiments are conducted with modified versions of Solomon’s benchmark instances. The numerical results show that the proposed two-stage algorithm is able to find optimal solutions for small-sized instances and good-quality robust solutions for large-sized instances with little increase to the total travel distance and/or the number of vehicles used. A detailed analysis of the results also reveals several managerial insights for decision-makers in the logistics industry.}

The analysis characterizes the flow of resources among firms in a reverse supply chain in the Norwegian electronics industry. The study subsequently examines influences of governance mechanisms and culture on the social, ecological, and economic performance in the supply chain. Based on principal-agency theory, the authors implicate collaboration, monitoring, and specific assets as determinants of the interfirm culture operating in the reverse supply chain. The interfirm culture and collaboration serve as antecedents to triple bottom line performance. Data collected with Norwegian electronics collectors indicate that collaboration and interfirm culture influence ecological, economic, and relational components of sustainable performance.}

In particular, we attempt to estimate the energy production and the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) at some selected provinces with high potential availability of rice straw. Accordingly, a proposed configuration of biomass Rankine cycle power plant fed with rice straw is modeled and simulated using System Advisor Model (SAM). The simulation shows that the average nominal and the average real LCOE for the proposed power plants are 10.55 and 6.33 ¢/kWh respectively, which is very competitive, compared with LCOE of other renewable energy technologies in Egypt. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to investigate the effect of the main technical and economic variables of the power plant on the energy output and LCOE. The results reveal that flue gas temperature, rice straw moisture content and excesses fed air significantly affect the energy output. Furthermore, the results indicate that LCOE is highly sensitive to feedstock price and discount rate. Policy makers and stakeholders could use these results for developing strategic capacity plans based on biomass power plants possibly integrated with other electricity sources and the utility grid.}

If a street is narrow or traffic is light, it is possible (and often desirable) to service both sides of the street in a single pass by zigzagging. However, if a street is wide or traffic is heavy, we must service the street by two single traversals. For some streets, we further assume that they may only be zigzagged early in the morning when the traffic is low. Real-life applications arise, among others, in trash collection and newspaper delivery. This problem is solved by transforming it into a node routing problem and present a mathematical formulation.}

In order to improve the return rate of used products, in this paper, a recovery framework is proposed by employing buy-back offer at retailer level. The proposed recovery framework is integrated with an optimization model for a multi-period CLSC under demand and capacity uncertainty to determine optimal buy-back price that needs to be offered to consumers so that the minimum collection limit set by the legislators is fulfilled as well as overall cost of the integrated system is minimized. The developed model addresses the possibility of three way recovery options, namely; product remanufacturing, component remanufacturing, and raw material recovery to determine the optimal manufacturing, remanufacturing and recycling quantity. Sensitivity analysis suggests that there is a trade-off between the extra benefit generated through remanufacturing and the cost of acquisition of used products due to the employment of buy-back offer. A condition for the buy-back offer to be simultaneously advantageous for both manufacturer and retailer under revenue sharing contract is derived. A comparative study is also undertaken to examine the performance of the CLSC when collection is made through buy-back offer vs. third-party collection. The proposed CLSC model is further extended by adding a separate demand for remanufactured products and the performance of the initial model with the extended model is compared.}

The main principle is to unload, sort, consolidate and transfer delivered packages from inbound trucks to outbound trucks, with a minimum of storage or treatment in between. Two key issues associated to this field are the truck scheduling and the shop-floor operation scheduling. We propose a mixed integer linear programming model to schedule truck arrivals, shop-floor activities and truck departures. The cross-dock configuration we study is based on an industrial case on the automotive industry. In particular, a repack operation and two temporary storage zones are considered. The objective is to minimize internal operation cost (penalty related to extra capacity needs) and outbound transportation cost (number of trucks). The model is implemented and tested in CPLEX with small size instances, based on industrial data. The proposed model could be easily adapted to a variety of cross-dock configurations, in terms of internal capacity and cost distribution.}

abstract = {The issue of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) management is an ever increasing problem, especially because solid waste from industry and other Closed-loop Supply Chain Waste (CLSCW) is included in MSW. Dealing with very large amounts of MSW per capita is a global problem, forcing municipalities and industry to develop new systemic approaches and technological solutions. One of the well-accepted solutions is energy recovery from MSW and CLSCW. The Waste-to-Energy (WTE) policy significantly reduces the volume of waste disposed in landfills, influences the reduction of total greenhouse gas emissions, and gives the potential for generating electricity or developing co-generation of electricity and heat. Nevertheless, there are still high uncertainties regarding the optimal decision on investments in cogeneration plants. In this paper we shall not discuss the technical characteristics of plants. Our focus is on the choices regarding investment costs and efficiency which also depend on the uncertain demand for supply system products, which is in correlation with the quantity of waste. In general, the recovered items must be distributed from the recycling facility back to production, and waste items must be sent to landfills, for which taxes and fees have to be paid. Alternatively, waste items can be reversibly used as a source of energy with several technological methods – most commonly the burning process. The uncertain energy efficiency of cogeneration plants and the uncertainty of demand appear simultaneously. In this paper, the methods for supporting decisions in optimal investment or co-investment in the urban cogeneration plant in case of joint actions of local authorities responsible for MSW and CLSC managers is considered when energy efficiency is normally distributed or fuzzy, at volatile demand, which has never been studied jointly. Extended MRP theoretical results are compared to the solutions of fuzzy reasoning. We show how MRP Theory can be used for evaluating the investments, but also how fuzzy reasoning is losing its potential in case of lower demand.}

During the logistics processes, many problems might arise, which should have already been addressed in the planning phase. In our days, the symptomatic treatment is a common practice, but it does not provide predictability. The obvious solution would be process control, in order to handle the main sources of faults and to give a correct list of what needs to be done during the logistics process. The process description languages may be useful not only in standardisation, but they may also help to avoid losses. Simulation experiments, on the basis of built model, also allow for the elimination of problems, standardisation and the limitation of losses. The aim of the article is a discussion of selected coordination mechanisms in the supply chain, its modelling in the form of a reference, as well as a discussion of the simulation experiment with the use of the FlexSim tool.}

Over this period the policy, based on the liberalization of the Single European Market in the 10 years before 2000, changed from purely national to supranational, on a pan-European scale. This period saw the expansion of the EU to the East and the changing make-up of the Union and the Commission and witnessed how the political nature of the policy adapts. The research is the first accessible, objective and independent review of overall EU surface freight policy. The review show that, by 2011, intervention, modal shift and intermodalism have been replaced by “smart,” “green,” and “integrated” themes, alongside economic competitiveness and growth. The key change is that policy now looks to separate mobility from its negative effects; for example, behavioral change orientation programs, such as road pricing for freight, have declined in importance. Innovative technology, by contrast, is the chosen tool of the current EU freight policy to meet ambitious emission reduction targets, led by the decarbonization of road haulage. The tension between technocracy and explicit political intent is evident in the development and is discussed. Successful and unsuccessful freight policies are also drawn, discussed and concluded.}

SmartSite puts major emphasis on sensing and communication technologies that integrate real-time automated information exchange in the supply chain of road construction. As part of the larger SmartSite project, this article introduces a novel real-time path planning system for compactors and presents the results of several simulation and field realistic experiments conducted to evaluate the system in a sophisticated simulation and harsh construction environment, respectively. The system operates based on Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) software agents and real-time sensory inputs. The newly developed integrated and information rich process benefits asphalt compactor operators, as they are now capable to control their machinery and react to changing environmental, material-related and process-related disturbances or changes. This improves the quality of the delivery and laying of asphalt material, prevents compactors from over-compacting certain road segments, increases the road's pavement longevity during the operational life cycle phase; refocuses the work tasks of the site managers, and reduces the construction budget and schedule. The system's ability to maneuver an asphalt roller during real-word operation also makes it an important step towards a fully automated asphalt compactor.}

In this paper, we introduce a novel vehicle routing problem with time window and pallet loading constraints; this problem accounts for the actual needs of businesses in the logistics industry such as the delivery of consumer goods and agricultural products. To solve this new VRP, we propose a hybrid approach by combining Tabu search and the artificial bee colony algorithm. A new benchmark data set is generated to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm because the proposed VRP has never been reported in the literature. Experiments are performed for a data set of Solomon's 56 vehicle routing problem with time windows. Our approach is superior to a number of other heuristic algorithms in a comparison on Solomon's VRPTW instances.}

The distribution network involves a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles each with the given capacity and with a variable transportation cost and a fixed cost with a discounting mechanism. Due to nonlinearity of the discounting mechanism, a nonlinear mathematical programming model is developed. A prioritized K-mean clustering encoding is introduced to designate the distribution depots distances, their demands, and the vehicles’ capacity. Using this priority clustering, a heuristic routine is developed by which heavy capacity vehicles are assigned to the longer distance depots. Then the proposed heuristic is incorporated into a new GA to construct a hybrid GA. Through an extensive computational experiment, first the algorithm parameters are tuned using “factorial experimental designs”, and then the efficiency of the proposed algorithm is compared with the powerful package of the CPLEX solver (OPL 12.3.0.1 Model) and two existing algorithms. The results are revealed that the proposed algorithm can provide superior solutions with the minimal computational effort.}

abstract = {We study a network improvement problem to increase the resilience of a transportation network against disasters. This involves optimizing pre-disaster investment decisions to strengthen the links of the network structurally. The goal is to improve the expected post-disaster accessibility. We first propose a new dependency model for random link failures to predict the post-disaster status of the network. We show that the probability of any network realization can be computed using a Bayesian network representation of the dependency model. As the computational effort grows with the network size, we use our proposed dependency model in a network sampling algorithm. We then estimate an accessibility measure, namely, the expected weighted average distance between supply and demand points by checking pre-generated short and dissimilar paths in the sample. We minimize this measure and decide on the links that should be strengthened in a two-stage stochastic programming framework. As the failure probability of a strengthened link decreases, the discrete scenario probabilities depend on the first-stage decisions. To tackle this challenge, we develop an efficient tabu search algorithm. We apply our methods to a case study of Istanbul under the risk of an earthquake, both to illustrate the use of the methods and to derive insights for decision makers.}

The paper takes the case 12 of Anji cup Logistics Competition as the background, first describes relevant content about milk-run route, milk-run route is the circle pickup route. Then it puts forward the problems in the process of circulation pickup by analyzing the pick-up routes of auto parts in Anji-company. With the aid of the improved C-W algorithm, and build a mathematical model on how to optimize the milk-run routes based on time window constraint, finally solves the problems by using C++ programs, which makes the 8 pickup route schemes to develop the program. It not only proposes solutions to the existence problems of Anji-company, but also provides ideas in the study of optimization milk-run routes for another logistics companies, what's more, it has a strong significant meaning.}

abstract = {Decentralised wastewater treatment is increasingly gaining interest as a means of responding to sustainability challenges. Cost comparisons are a crucial element of any sustainability assessment. While the cost characteristics of centralised waste water management systems (WMS) have been studied extensively, the economics of decentralised WMS are less understood. A key motivation for studying the costs of decentralised WMS is to compare the cost of centralised and decentralised WMS in order to decide on cost-efficient sanitation solutions. This paper outlines a model designed to assess those costs which depend on the spatial density of decentralised wastewater treatment plants in a region. Density-related costs are mostly linked to operation and maintenance activities which depend on transportation, like sludge removal or the visits of professionals to the plants for control, servicing or repairs. We first specify a modelled cost-density relationship for a region in a geometric two-dimensional space by means of heuristic routing algorithms that consider time and load-capacity restrictions. The generic model is then applied to a Swiss case study for which we specify a broad range of modelling parameters. As a result, we identify a ‘hockey-stick’-shaped cost curve that is characterised by strong cost reductions at high density values which level out at around 1 to 1.5 plants per km2. Variations in the cost curves are mostly due to differences in management approaches (scheduled or unscheduled emptying). In addition to the well-known diseconomies of scale in the case of centralised sanitation, we find a similar generic cost behaviour for decentralised sanitation due to economies of density. Low densities in sparsely populated regions thus result in higher costs for both centralised and decentralised system. Policy implications are that efforts to introduce decentralised options in a region should consider the low-density/high-cost problem when comparing centralised and decentralised options.}

The algorithm is based on the ant colony optimization (ACO) metaheuristic, which is combined and integrated with the Floyd–Warshall (FW) algorithm, and is therefore referred to as FW–ACO. To assess the performance of the FW–ACO algorithm, two sets of analyses are carried out. Firstly, the capability of the algorithm to provide effective solutions for the picking problem is analyzed as a function of the settings of the main ACO parameters. Secondly, the performance of the FW–ACO algorithm is compared with that of six algorithms typically used to optimize the travel distance of pickers, including exact algorithms for the solution of the travelling salesman problem (where available), two heuristic routing strategies (i.e. S-shape and largest gap) and two metaheuristic algorithms (i.e. the MIN–MAX ant system and Combined+). The comparison is made considering different warehouse layouts and problem complexities. The outcomes obtained suggest that the FW–ACO is a promising algorithm generally able to provide better results than the heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms, and often able to find an exact solution. The FW–ACO algorithm also shows a very efficient computational time, which makes it suitable for defining the route of pickers in real time. The FW–ACO algorithm is finally implemented in a real case study, where constraints exist on the order in which items should be picked, to show its practical usefulness and quantify the resulting savings.}

We propose a conceptual framework that extends the existing CLSC setting by introducing consumers’ disposition behavior. We develop eleven research propositions based on which we design a survey. The survey was sent to decision making executives of different remanufacturing industries to solicit their perception. Participants were also asked to make paired comparisons using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), based on which an action oriented framework is developed. Firms that have CLSC operation can use our framework to ensure enhanced quality product returns which in turn increase profitability. Finally, possible future extensions are discussed.}

Although vehicle kilometres travelled associated with shopping trips might decrease as a result of online shopping, an increased number of failed home deliveries might out-weigh this reduction, worsening urban transport problems caused by high car dependency. In many European countries, such as France, UK and the Netherlands, Collection and Delivery Points (CDPs) have been implemented and observed to increase delivery efficiency by reducing the number of failed home deliveries. Similar to the worldwide trend of online shopping, a major proportion of New Zealanders also shop online. However, CDPs were only recently introduced in limited locations within three of New Zealand’s biggest cities, i.e. Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch. Thus, little is understood about New Zealanders’ acceptance of CDPs and their online shopping behaviour. This study aimed to address these issues by means of focus groups, using Christchurch as a case study. The results show that the factors influencing the Christchurch’s residents’ acceptance of CDPs, can be categorised into several themes, such as CDP network density, parking availability at CDPs, spatial location of CDPs, proximity to consumers’ home or office, safe and secure operation, and hours of operation of CDPs. Such knowledge is important for policy makers to help formulate policies that can lead to more sustainable urban environments, and for the companies that want to establish successful CDP networks in Christchurch.}

In this paper, we study a low carbon for location routing problem with heterogeneous fleet, simultaneous pickup-delivery and time windows and design a two-phased hybrid heuristic algorithm to solve the problem. Firstly, we introduce the concept of temporal-spatial distance and use genetic algorithm to cluster the customer points to construct the initial path. Then, we use variable neighborhood search algorithm for local search. By incorporating the idea of simulated annealing algorithm into the framework of variable neighborhood algorithm, the global optimization ability of the algorithm is improved. At the same time, the vehicle adjustment strategy is added in the optimization process. The computational experiments are implemented to investigate the performance of the proposed heuristic algorithm. Computational results show that the initial solution considering temporal-spatial distance has obvious advantages in the efficiency of the algorithm and the quality of the solution.}

This study integrated semi-structured interviews and a survey questionnaire on the basis of the Theory of Planned Behaviour, setting it apart from conventional studies on food waste behavioural factors. Qualitative content analysis and quantitative structural equation modelling were performed to analyse the interview and questionnaire responses, followed by correlation analysis to quantify the relationships between variables. The results demonstrate that food waste recycling behaviour is determined by three latent variables—administrative incentives and corporate support, logistics and management incentives, and economic incentives. Administrative incentives and corporate support demonstrate significant effects on recycling behaviour. Moral attitudes show a strong positive correlation with administrative incentives and corporate support. Similarly, there is a significant positive correlation between moral attitudes and logistics and management incentives. Administrative incentives and corporate support is the determining variable for the hotel and food and beverages industries, whereas logistics and management incentives are of the highest concern to property management representatives. These findings can facilitate the development of stakeholder-oriented policy to encourage corporate behavioural change towards food waste recycling for sustainable resource circulation.}

We present an agent-based method which makes use of reinforcement learning in order to estimate the efficiency of a Port Community System. We have evaluated the method using two weeks of observations of import containers at the Port of Brisbane as a case study. Three scenarios are examined. The first scenario evaluates the observed container delivery by individual shipping lines and estimates the consignments allocated to the various road carriers based on optimizing the individual shipper's total logistics cost. The second scenario implies that, in the optimum case, all agents (shipping lines and road carriers) communicate and cooperate through a single portal. The objective of cooperation is in sharing vehicles and creating tours to deliver shipments to several importers in order to reduce total logistics costs, while physical and time window constraints are also considered. The third scenario allows for some agents to occasionally decide to act based on individual costs instead of total combined logistics costs. The results of this study indicate an increase in the efficiency of the whole logistics process through cooperation, and the study provides a prototype of a Port Community System to support logistics decisions.}

Introduction
Les pénuries de médicaments sont un problème complexe et à multiples facettes qui affecte à la fois les patients, les professionnels de santé, l’industrie pharmaceutique et les organismes de réglementation.
Objectif
L’objectif principal de notre étude est d’identifier, de décrire et de comparer les ruptures de médicaments auxquelles deux centres hospitaliers, l’un français et l’autre canadien ont dû faire face à partir de données nationales et locales de ruptures de médicaments.
Méthodologie
Nous avons mené une étude transversale descriptive et comparative sur une journée, soit le 22 octobre 2015, à partir des données disponibles au niveau national et local en France et au Canada.
Résultats
En ce qui concerne les données nationales, un total de 33 ruptures de médicaments était répertorié sur le site de l’Agence nationale de sécurité du médicament (ANSM) et des produits de santé le 22 octobre 2015 contre 760 sur le site de pénuries de médicaments au Canada. En ce qui concerne les données locales, 84 ruptures de médicaments étaient répertoriées en France, contre 85 au Canada. Pour l’ensemble des ruptures recensées à l’échelle nationale et locale, 49 fabricants étaient concernés par des ruptures de médicaments en France contre 56 au Canada.
Conclusion
Il existe peu de données sur les ruptures de médicaments. Cette étude descriptive et transversale met en évidence un nombre plus élevé de ruptures au Canada qu’en France à l’échelle nationale mais un nombre similaire à l’échelle de deux établissements de santé de Lyon et de Montréal. La problématique des ruptures de médicaments est préoccupante et cette étude met en évidence la nécessité de s’intéresser à cette situation et de s’impliquer pour faire face aux difficultés qui en découlent.
Summary
Introduction
Drug shortages are a complex and multifaceted problem that affects both patients, health professionals, the pharmaceutical industry and regulatory authorities.
Objectives
The main objective of our study is to identify, to describe and compare drugs shortages in two hospitals, one French and one Canadian, which were faced with drug shortages, from national and local data of drug shortages.
Methods
We conducted a comparative and descriptive cross-sectional study on October 22 2015, from the data available on both national and local levels in France and Canada.
Results
With regard to national data, a total of 33 drug shortages was listed on the website of the ANSM (National Agency for Medicines and Health Products Safety) on October 22, 2015 compared with 760 listed on the Drug Shortage website in Canada. Regarding local data, a total of 84 drug shortages were listed in the central pharmacy of the Hospices Civils de Lyon, France, on October 22, 2015, compared with 85 at the CHU Sainte-Justine in Canada. For all the drug shortages identified nationally and locally, 49 manufacturers were affected by drugs shortages in France compared with 56 in Canada. Applying these data locally, we get a ratio of 49/260 in France and 56/121 in Canada.
Conclusion
There is little data on drug shortages. This descriptive and cross-sectional study shows a higher number of drug shortages in Canada than in France at a national level but similar numbers across two healthcare institutions in Lyon and in Montreal. The problem of drug shortages is worrying and this study highlights the need to address this situation and to get involved to face the difficulties that result.}

abstract = {Most jacket installations located in offshore regions require daily transportation of crew with helicopter, which imposes huge operational costs on oil and gas companies. In order to save on crew exchange costs, the daily flight schedule must be planned in a way that all constraints related to origin-destination itinerary, sortieing, flight length, capacity and crew member’s arrival time to the onshore base be met and the finish time of the final sortie be minimized. For this helicopter routing and crew exchange problem, two different mathematical models are developed which differ in the way the nodes and arcs are defined, and accordingly, the way the decision variables are defined. These models were solved to optimality for test problems up to 11 jackets and 28 crew members, and for the real case of South Pars Gas Field, the world's largest gas field, up to 11 jackets and 46 passengers. Considering the future extensions of the South Pars Gas Field and for problems of larger sizes, given the nature of the problem which is a grouping problem, a new algorithm, namely the hybrid Grouping Evolution Strategy (HGES), is proposed which works based on the composition of the flight sorties rather than working with each nodes in isolation. Several heuristics and a local search algorithm are incorporated in the body of GES to enhance its performance. Extensive computational experiments demonstrate that HGES can produce good solutions in an acceptable amount of time which is fit for operational use, as compared with particle swarm optimization (PSO) and pure Grouping Evolution Strategy algorithm. A GUI has also been designed to eliminate the complexity and inefficiency of the current method which is on “by-eye” basis.}

Its specific impact can be considered rather low, but the large generated volume and embodied resource makes this waste stream an important focus of current European policies. The European Commission has proposed new targets and goals for this waste stream in the Circular Economy package, but, given the rather heterogeneous landscape of waste management practice across Member States, new approaches that take into account the entire value chain of the construction sector are urgently required. This paper synthesises core principles and linked best practices for the management of construction and demolition waste across the entire construction value chain. Systematic implementation of these best practices could dramatically improve resource efficiency and reduce environmental impact by: reducing waste generation, minimising transport impacts, maximising re-use and recycling by improving the quality of secondary materials and optimising the environmental performance of treatment methods.}

We approximate the Pareto front using the weighted sum and epsilon constraint scalarization methods with pre-defined or adaptively selected parameters, two popular evolutionary algorithms, SPEA2 and NSGA-II, with different selection strategies, and their interactive counterparts that incorporate Decision Maker׳s (DM׳s) indirect preferences into the search process. Within this case study, the CO2 emissions could be lowered significantly by accepting a marginal increase of costs over their global minimum. NSGA-II and SPEA2 enabled faster estimation of the Pareto front, but produced significantly worse solutions than the exact optimization methods. The interactive methods outperformed their a posteriori counterparts, and could discover solutions corresponding better to the DM preferences. In addition, by adjusting appropriately the elicitation interval and starting generation of the elicitation, the number of pairwise comparisons needed by the interactive evolutionary methods to construct a satisfactory solution could be decreased.}

The recourse to a socio-semiotic reading here favours a deeper comprehension of the question of consumers' trust in large retailers. It proposes a typology of four distinct virtual strategies responding to the diverse consumer perceptions brought to light: persuasion, rejection, suspicion, and alignment. This leads to a discussion of the strategies offered by different large retailers to meet their consumers' perceptions and expectations. Lastly, the results outline the importance of deploying targeted communication and of aligning sustainable transport practices in accordance with the identified consumer postures.}

In theory, shifting some of these deliveries to off-hours would decrease both traffic pressure during high traffic periods as well as the time needed to carry out deliveries. However, research has shown that there are also negative effects and that different stakeholders have very different points of view. Until today, the pros and cons have not been examined from the perspective of the various stakeholders. The questions at stake are whether in certain situations there is overall stakeholder support for a shift to off-hour deliveries and how we can assess this support. This paper presents Multi Actor Multi Criteria Analysis (MAMCA) (Macharis, 2005) as the appropriate tool for measuring support for urban off-hour deliveries and describes the application of this methodology to a case study of a large food retailer in Brussels. MAMCA is an extension of the widely used Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA), and it explicitly includes the goals and objectives of all stakeholders when evaluating a set of alternatives. The analysis reveals that, in Brussels, a shift to off-hour deliveries to supermarkets should receive overall support because there are no scenarios that score very high for one stakeholder and very low for another and the scenarios that envision a high proportion of night deliveries receive a high score. The retailer prefers a scenario with an even delivery distribution throughout the day, while the other two stakeholders prefer more morning deliveries.}

The goal of this research is to assure that a logistics company would satisfy the demands of customers with a high probability, while minimizing the overall transportation cost. We introduce the concept of premium customers, who are guaranteed a higher level of service. We show that our chance-constrained method has some strategic advantages over the CVRP with recourse approach. We examine the possibility of the logistics company charging customers selectively with an additional service fee to assure a high level of service. Moreover, we provide managerial insight on when the best time is to pay for the premium membership. We present computational results on commonly studied small to large-scale CVRP instances. A simulation study is conducted to explore the performance of the proposed chance-constrained approach using the CVRP with recourse. We conclude that our chance-constrained CVRP model could serve a logistics company well when resource costs and service guarantees are of concern.}

In France, these hospitals deliver mainly home health care by employing liberal nurses and liberal physicians (patients’ referring physicians), but they employ also salaried nurses and salaried physicians to control the quality of cares and to ensure the care continuity, respectively. The cares and the physicians’ consultations are organized through home tour schedules. In the event of a flood, home tours can be compromised depending on home accessibility. A patient home can be easily or hardly accessible and the home care tour can be or not prolonged depending on the time required to reach each patient home. In the case where the patient home is invaded by the water, the patient must be evacuated to a regular hospital or to a field hospital which has been set up temporarily to receive the evacuated patients. In this paper, a decision-making tool is proposed to face the hydrological disaster i.e. to decide: which patients must be evacuated, which resources must be used to keep patients at home, and how many beds are required to host the evacuated patients. With such a tool, home health care structures can initiate the required collaborations in order to be ready to respond to such emergency crisis and plan patient evacuations during the flood.}

The proposed study aims to provide simple quantitative tools based on Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to support the evaluation process of intermodal supply chains. A sample of 44 real-world Mediterranean supply chains has been collected and analyzed. Four quantitative KPIs describing the relationship time-cost and the ratio cost/kilometer have been derived from empirical cost functions and used to characterize the various elements of the analyzed transport chains, and of the chains as a whole, from a cost perspective.}

abstract = {Conventionally, vehicle routing problems are defined on a network in which the customer locations and arcs are given. Typically, these arcs somehow represent the distances or expected travel time derived from the underlying road network. When executed, the quality of the solutions obtained from the vehicle routing problem depends largely on the quality of the road network representation. This paper explicitly considers path selection in the road network as an integrated decision in the time-dependent vehicle routing problem, denoted as path flexibility (PF). This means that any arc between two customer nodes has multiple corresponding paths in the road network (geographical graph). Hence, the decisions to make are involving not only the routing decision but also the path selection decision depending upon the departure time at the customers and the congestion levels in the relevant road network. The corresponding routing problem is a time-dependent vehicle routing problem with path flexibility (TDVRP–PF). We formulate the TDVRP–PF models under deterministic and stochastic traffic conditions. We derive important insights, relationships, and solution structures. Based on a representative testbed of instances (inspired on the road network of Beijing), significant savings are obtained in terms of cost and fuel consumption, by explicitly considering path flexibility. Having both path flexibility and time-dependent travel time seems to be a good representation of a wide range of stochasticity and dynamics in the travel time, and path flexibility serves as a natural recourse under stochastic conditions. Exploiting this observation, we employ a Route-Path approximation method generating near-optimal solutions for the TDVRP–PF under stochastic traffic conditions.}

Through an in-depth case study of an ETO company this paper investigates the challenges, problems and improvement opportunities in the business processes of an ETO company by applying an adapted value stream mapping (VSM) approach. The study served to identify main sources of waste which negatively affect lead time in ETO operations.

To solve the proposed fuzzy multi-objective mixed integer programme model, a methodology is designed by combining various techniques. Numerical experiments were conducted to provide important policy insights for industry practitioners and the government such as (1) developed carbon tax-reward policy and carbon-tax- reward-forex policy other than carbon tax policy for future tyre remanufacturing supply chain carbon emission policies, (2) evaluated the possible influence of distance of used product suppliers from initial deposit facility on reconfigurable tyre remanufacturing strategic supply chain planning, (3) designed the measure of the greenness i.e. the greenness index of various tyre remanufacturing supply chains to compare various supply chains in the tyre remanufacturing industry, (4) suggested the foreign exchange (forex) reward rate for a tyre remanufacturing supply chain on basis of its greenness index in the tyre remanufacturing industry.}

As the name implies, AHD involves delivery of needed goods at the customer's doorsteps or nearby via walking or short-distance vehicle. Considering no-show and random response time, this article presents an integrative approach that combines appointment scheduling and vehicle routing problem with soft time windows. We also propose an intuitive heuristic dynamic programming to tackle the appointment scheduling problem whose optimal decision is expected to be very complicated, embed it into tabu search and formulate a hybrid heuristic algorithmto solve this integrative model. Moreover, an extension to hard time windows has also been discussed. Our results indicate that the integrative approach could lead to high-quality solutions in a reasonable amount of runtimeas compared to the hierarchical approach.}

The proposed GA is inspired by the solving mechanism of CPLEX for the optimization model of the problem. The proposed GA determines replenishment times and quantities and vehicle routes in a decoupled manner, while maximizing supply chain profits. The proposed GA is compared with the optimization model with respect to the effectiveness and efficiency in various test problems. The proposed GA finds solutions in a short computational time that are very close to those obtained with the optimization model for small problems and solutions that are within 3.2% of those for large problems. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis is conducted to investigate the effects of several problem parameters on the performance of the proposed GA and total profits.}

abstract = {This paper addresses the vehicle routing and selection problem of single and multi-compartment vehicles for grocery distribution. Retailers used to rely on single-compartment vehicles (SCV), and transported only one temperature-specific product segment with this vehicle type. Retailers now have the option of using multi-compartment vehicles (MCV) due to technological advances. Products requiring differing temperature zones can be transported jointly as the loading area is split into separate compartments. Both vehicle types cause different costs for loading, transportation and unloading. In literature either the use of SCVs or MCVs has been considered without a distinction between vehicle-dependent costs and the use of both vehicle types in the fleet to achieve a cost-optimal fleet mix. We therefore identify vehicle-dependent costs within empirical data collection and present an extended multi-compartment vehicle routing problem (MCVRP) for the vehicle selection. We solve the problem with a Large Neighborhood Search. Our numerical experiments are based on the insights we draw from a real-life case with a retailer. In further experiments we show that the mixed fleet is always better than an exclusive fleet of SCVs or MCVs and state which factors influence the cost reduction. A mixed fleet can reduce costs by up to 30%. As a result, mixed fleets are advisable in grocery distribution and vehicle selection should be part of the MCVRP.}

In this research, a tire remanufacturing CLSC network is designed and optimized based on tire recovery options. The objective of the optimization model is to maximize the total profit. The optimization model includes multiple products, suppliers, plants, retailers, demand markets, and drop-off depots. The application of the model is discussed based on a realistic network in Toronto, Canada using map. In addition, a new decision tree-based methodology is provided to calculate the net present value of the problem in multiple periods under different sources of uncertainty such as demand and returns. Furthermore, the discount cash flow is considered in the methodology as a novel innovative approach. This methodology can be applied in comparing the profitability of different design options for CLSCs.}

abstract = {Manufacturing systems exhibit two types of synchronization phenomena: logistics and physics. Quantifying synchronization measures for both types have been suggested and it has been shown that both types of synchronization are correlated to the logistics performance of the manufacturing system. Previous studies have indicated that structural properties of the manufacturing network might be central influencing factors triggering synchronization emergence. Synchronizability is a network property widely studied in the complex networks field. It is a common measure to evaluate the stability of synchronization in networks based on its structural properties. The aim of this paper is to explore synchronizability in manufacturing for the first time in order to better understand the impact of structural properties of a network on the emerging synchronization phenomena. We apply a multi-method investigation by triangulating a profound literature analysis, a two-stage discrete-event simulation study and an empirical data analysis of feedback data from industrial practice. Our findings show that synchronizability relates positively to physics and negatively to logistics synchronization. Based on these findings we present first considerations towards a synchronization-oriented design and control of manufacturing systems.}

The aim of the present study was to investigate effect of reduced lung function and exposure to background PAHs on diabetes. A total of 2730 individuals were drawn from the Wuhan-Zhuhai (WHZH) Cohort Study (n=3053). Participants completed physical examination, measurement of lung function and urinary monohydroxylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (OH-PAHs). Risk factors for type 2 diabetes were identified by multiple logistic regression analysis, and the presence of additive interaction between levels of urinary OH-PAHs and lower lung function was evaluated by calculation of the relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI) and attributable proportion due to interaction (AP). Urinary OH-PAHs levels was positively associated with type 2 diabetes among individuals with impaired lung function (p<0.05). Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1, odd ratio (OR): 0.664, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.491–0.900) and forced vital capacity (FVC, OR: 0.693, 95% CI: 0.537–0.893) were negatively associated with diabetes among individuals. Additive interaction of higher urinary levels of OH-PAHs and lower FVC (RERI: 0.679, 95% CI: 0.120–1.238); AP: 0.427, 95% CI: 0.072–0.782) was associated with diabetes. Exposure to background PAHs was related to diabetes among individuals with lower lung function. Urinary levels of OH-PAHs and reduced lung function had an additive effect on diabetes.}

The model is based on input from logistics cost models for urban areas combined with cost variables related to logistics processes, receiver attributes and local city characteristics. The cost variables for each aspect (logistics, receiver, city) influence the cost-effectiveness and applicability of an alternative distribution set-up. The model is applied on the delivery of fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) towards small independent retailers in a megacity. The current supply of these stores is characterized by high costs, inefficiency and unsustainability. Four different set-ups are modelled. The model shows the effects of different city and store request parameters. When drop sizes are low and distances are short, direct shipments with smaller vehicles outperform the current direct set-up. When drop sizes are low and distances are long, collaborating in an urban consolidation centre (UCC) shows a saving. The model can be further validated with data from other cities and other distribution set-ups.}

The customer purchases shipment insurance only when the cargo value is relatively high and his declared value does not exceed the actual cargo value. The optimal insurance premiums for both contracts and contract preference are obtained. Finally, we investigate the impact of effort towards transport process improvement.}
