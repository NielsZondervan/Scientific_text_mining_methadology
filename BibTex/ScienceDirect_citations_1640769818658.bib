abstract = {The modular construction method has been adopted extensively by the construction sector for pursuing higher building quality and better project efficiency. However, the employment of this new construction method has not only altered the definition of construction supply chains, but also poses new challenges to the logistics system which has conventionally focused on raw material transportation. This challenge is exacerbated in the transport and inventory aspects when the project is executed in urban settings, owing to the frequent traffic congestion, crowded environment, as well as the bulkiness and delicacy of finished modules. This study develops a multi-stage stochastic programming model for identifying the optimal supply chain configuration for the modular construction method. Site demand is considered to be stochastic, forcing project managers to make several operational decisions at multiple time points during project execution. The developed model can provide the best production, transportation and inventory plans, as well as the most favourable initial inventory preparation schemes. Furthermore, we have proven that the implementation of multi-stage stochastic programming model can yield more economical and risk-averse solutions than the two-stage stochastic programming approach.}

Production logistics systems, as integrated production and logistics systems, have attracted increased attention in supply chain and industrial production research. This paper focuses on the problem of unbalanced and unreasonable resource allocation caused by the lack of an efficient and practical resource allocation methodology in production logistics systems. We propose a resource allocation methodology for a production logistics system, and provide the specific modelling and simulation procedures. In the case study, we use factor experiment to distinguish bottleneck resources from non-bottleneck resources, and compare the performance of 160 different allocation schemes, and obtain the optimal configuration of each resource including the number of AGV, the speed of AGV and the capacity of each buffer based on the proposed methodology and simulation procedures. The results of the case study illustrate the effectiveness and practicality of the resource allocation methodology based on object-oriented discrete event simulation. Both the case study and the allocation methodology can provide reference for similar resource allocation problems.}

This provides the systemic view of the national freight logistics landscape that is required to address logistics challenges within the context of a country's socio-economic objectives. The results highlight that South Africa's macrologistics costs exceed that of trading partners, with road transport the dominant cost contributor. Investing in domestic intermodal solutions will reduce both transport and externality costs. This, in turn, will improve the competitiveness of domestic and international freight, and support economic and ecological development objectives. Rail branch line densification will improve market access for rural economies and reduce logistics costs while supporting social development objectives. These applications provide examples of data-driven policy development and infrastructure investments. The level of spatial and sectoral disaggregation in the South Africa's Freight Demand ModelTM, and the flow-level link with a logistics costs model, within the context of the national input-output model, is to the best of our knowledge unique. This link to economic aggregates in the South Africa's Freight Demand ModelTM input data bridges logistics' analytical gap to macroeconomic decision-making.}

Corporate social responsibility performance is measured with a composite ESG (environmental, social, and governance) score and with its three sub-dimensions between 2011 and 2018. Fixed Effects regression analysis was run to test the hypotheses, and subsequently, Ordinary Least Squares regression was run to test the robustness of the results. The results suggest that board gender diversity is positively associated with overall corporate social responsibility performance and governance performance. Moreover, the firms which have a sustainability committee are more likely to have greater corporate social responsibility performance (both overall and social) than those do not. Furthermore, firms with diffused ownership structures are more likely to show greater performance in the Social Pillar of corporate social responsibility. Board independence has a weak association with only governance performance. Contrary to expectations, the results regarding the value-relevance of corporate social responsibility performance did not produce significant positive outcomes. These findings confirm that women on boards and corporate social responsibility committees are an essential factor to achieve corporate social responsibility goals. However, the insignificant relationship between board characteristics and the Environmental Pillar of corporate social responsibility performance is quite surprising, and the discovery sparks various queries. Finally, logistics firms need to reconsider the competency or role of independent directors in corporate social responsibility issues as currently they are weakly influential.}

abstract = {Pennycress (Thlaspi arvense L.) is a winter annual oilseed crop with relatively high seed oil content (25-36%-wet basis), which can be planted as cover crop in corn-soybean rotation in the Midwestern U.S., to provide both economic benefits and ecosystem services. Pennycress oil has adequate quality for conversion to renewable jet fuel (RJF); however, the technical feasibility and cost of pennycress supply at the commercial scale have not been evaluated; so, the objective of this study was to evaluate techno-economics of the production, harvest and post-harvest logistics of pennycress as an RJF feedstock. In addition, an uncertainty analysis was performed to address the inherent variability of the parameters used for this evaluation. This study considered the feedstock supply for a biorefinery with RJF production capacity of around 19 million liters per year (i.e., 5 million gallons per year) in Ohio. Technical feasibility included the assessment of resources (land, infrastructure, machineries, fuel, labor, and consumables) for the production (i.e., planting, fertilizer and pesticide applications), harvest and post-harvest logistics (i.e., grain handling, transportation, drying and storage). Economic analyses included estimation of pennycress production and logistics costs. Annual pennycress seed requirement for the selected biorefinery capacity was estimated to be 90–115 thousand t (90% central range - CR), which would require pennycress plantation in 41–63 thousand ha (90% CR) land in corn-soybean rotation. The direct fossil fuel use ratio (i.e., fossil fuel use per liter of RJF produced) for pennycress production and logistics was estimated to be 0.06–0.09 L/L (90% CR). Estimated total cost for the production and logistics was 170–230 $/t (90% CR); and it was identified to be highly sensitive to pennycress seed yield. The outcomes of this research contribute to identifying the bottlenecks and hotspots for establishment of pennycress at the commercial scale in corn-soybean rotation in Ohio and Midwestern U.S.}

abstract = {The sustainability of food chains is an issue consumers, policy makers, researchers, food producers and suppliers are increasingly interested in. This interest is also confirmed by the considerable development of short food supply chain (SFSC) initiatives as an alternative to the globalised food chains typical of the contemporary food industry. However, while SFSCs have grown over the recent years, their logistics is still a challenging issue affecting their performance. Previous SFSC-focused literature reviews have neglected this particular aspect, concentrating primarily on the different forms of supply chains and the benefits and limitations associated with SFSC. The goal of this paper, instead, is to increase researchers’ and practitioners’ knowledge of the role and potential of logistics in improving the effectiveness and sustainability of SFSCs. This work, in fact, focuses on this specific and relevant aspect of SFSC and highlights its possible impact on SFSC development. From a logistics perspective, it identifies a series of actions to be implemented to effectively improve SFSC: to make environmental sustainable choices during all the phases of food distribution, to optimise the location of supply chain nodes, to improve the distribution route and restructure the supply chain. In addition to these actions, farmers are required to adopt an open approach to innovative distribution systems, vertical and horizontal collaboration as well as to cooperation with researchers. The paper's conclusions provide suggestions for future research development and underline the necessity to adopt a holistic and integrated approach and abandon a retrospective evaluation analysis in favour of a more dynamic and future-orientated attitude.}

This has resulted in the increased logistics cost, energy consumption, logistics resources consumption, and the decreased loading rate. Therefore, it is difficult to achieve efficient, sustainable, and green logistics services with dramatically increasing logistics demands. To deal with such challenges, a real-time information-driven dynamic optimization strategy for smart vehicles and logistics tasks towards green logistics is proposed. Firstly, an ‘Internet of Things’-enabled real-time status sensing model of logistics vehicles is developed. It enables the vehicles to obtain and transmit real-time information to the dynamic distribution center, which manages value-added logistics information. Then, such information can be shared among logistics companies. A dynamic optimization method for smart vehicles and logistics tasks is developed to optimize logistics resources, and achieve a sustainable balance between economic, environmental, and social objectives. Finally, a case study is carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed optimization method. The results show that it contributes to reducing logistics cost and fuel consumption, improving vehicles' utilization rate, and achieving real-time logistics services with high efficiency.}

We solved this 3PL problem by developing an effective meta-heuristic based on the Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP). This is achieved by introducing novel attributes in the construction of the restricted candidate list while incorporating flexible and intelligent rules, some of which are inspired by expert knowledge. The approach performs order consolidation, locates transshipment points and performs an optimal assignment of shipments to the selected consolidation points dynamically and in real time. This intelligent system embeds expert knowledge within the design of neighbourhood reduction schemes and data structures to speed up the search. This is achieved by recording computed data that does not need to be recomputed again while avoiding unnecessary computations of the non-promising alternatives. The performance of this real time optimisation and scheduling tool is tested with a European 3PL company over a 13 weeks period in late 2017 resulting in a significant cost saving and a considerable reduction in CO2 emissions. This powerful decision support system assists the 3PL company in gaining competitive leadership advantage through producing promising quotes that turn customer requests into real customer orders.}

On the other hand, making investments in different pillars of competitiveness, such as infrastructure, higher education, etc., is expected to enhance logistics performance. In this study, this two-way interaction between the competitiveness and logistics performance of countries is investigated using a hybrid methodology. Initially, the causal directions between the competitiveness of countries and their logistics performance are established by using a Bayesian Net (BN). Subsequently, the cause-effect information gathered from the BN is taken as the input in a Partial Least Square (PLS) path model to highlight the competitiveness pillars that are more critical in contributing to countries’ logistics performance. As the last step, an importance-performance map analysis (IPMA) is applied to specify the importance of the pillars that have a significant effect on logistics performance. As a result, a roadmap is provided to policymakers that specify which pillars to focus on, thus delivering a significant and immediate improvement in the logistics performance and highlighting which logistics performance indicators will lead to improvements in the competitiveness of the countries. An empirical study is conducted based on two basic indexes, as follows: (1) the Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) and its pillars are used to track the competitiveness performance, and (2) the Logistics Performance Index (LPI) is used to analyze the logistics performance. According to the results, the most important GCI pillars that affect the logistics performance of a country are determined to be “Business Sophistication”, “Financial Market Development”, “Infrastructure” and “Good Market Efficiency” and “Higher Education and Training”. On the other hand, the improvement in the logistics performance index, in its turn, will especially influence the Market Size pillar of a country.}

Furthermore, and more significantly, the logistics sector performance is found to be an important enabler to trade. Therefore, economic growth in Asia is found to be conditional on the logistics performance level in the countries examined. Hence, from a policy perspective, investment in logistics infrastructure should be considered as an area of investment with the greatest possible benefits that has supreme returns for future growth in our selected countries.

Electronic waste management raises serious concerns due to its increasing quantity and hazardous nature in global business. The developed model is a multi-objective reverse logistics network for electronic waste management, and the concept of the triple bottom line approach has been considered in the proposed study. The suggested study makes a trade-off between conflicting objectives. The research considers first customers, collection centers, distribution centers, second customers, and reprocessing units consisting of return evaluation centers, recycling centers and refurbishing centers. The carbon cap-and-trade policy has also been incorporated into the model. The objectives of the formulated model are to maximize the profit and minimize the carbon emissions as well as maximizing the job opportunities in a reverse logistics network. To deal with the uncertainty, neutrosophic optimization has been applied to avoid unrealistic modeling. A related numerical example has been performed and the results show that the transportation cost contributes to the major fraction of the total cost. The reprocessing at the return evaluation and recycling centers are the main source of carbon emissions. Sensitivity analysis has also been conducted to assess the application of the proposed model. It shows that a drastic increase of 42.6% occurs in the profit value when the per-unit carbon trading price is increased by 40% and vice-versa. Also, a variation is seen in the parameters like carbon emissions at recycling center with a change in total emissions value and the average number of units processed by one worker at return evaluation center with a variation in the number of job creation value.}

Without PDT, we find that firm B's profit performance joining LSA will be hurt when the market competition intensity degree is either high or low. We characterize firm B's total sales and the allocation ratio because of firm A's logistics sharing to explain this interesting finding.

abstract = {Although some studies have focused on the evaluation of regional logistics efficiency in China along the Belt and Road Initiative (B&R Initiative), there exist research gaps pertaining to systematically exploring the effects of internal and external influencing factors on the efficiency, economic performance and environmental performance of regional logistics industry for different regions and time periods. Therefore, in this paper, the integration of the slack-based measure (SBM) model and hierarchical regression is developed to perform an 11-year dynamic analysis (2007–2017) with carbon emission constraint. The improvement directions for inefficient regions are provided by benchmark analysis. The decrement rate and increment rate are proposed to further reveal the redundancy or shortage degree of indicators. Our results reveal the large imbalance in logistics efficiency among China’s regions along the B&R Initiative. However, the gaps in efficiency between the eastern and western regions have narrowed since the launch of the B&R Initiative. With regression analysis, we find whether in regions along the Silk Road Economic Belt or the Maritime Silk Road, whether from 2007 to 2012 or from 2013 to 2017, the specialization degree of logistics industry plays a prominently positive role in logistics efficiency and a negative role in environmental performance. It is interesting to find the opposite effect of opening up level on efficiency between regions along the Maritime Silk Road (positive effect) and the Silk Road Economic Belt (negative effect). We find the seesaw effect of economic development level and government regulation on economic performance and environmental performance for the southwest region. In addition, from 2013 to 2017, the external factors that have a positive effect on efficiency have changed from the opening up level before 2013 to the regional economic development level.}

abstract = {This paper examines a new hybrid intercontinental freight transport alternative (IFTA) that combines a logistics island (i.e. an offshore container port), vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft, and ocean vessel transport. The hybrid IFTA offers a ‘midway’ alternative for intercontinental shippers that is cheaper (and slower) than conventional air freight, but slightly faster and significantly more reliable (albeit, more expensive) than conventional ocean vessel transport calling at busy ports that may be subject to disruptive delays. To compare the proposed hybrid IFTA with the conventional air- and ocean-based IFTAs, this paper employs a utility maximization framework. A mathematical model determines the shipper value of time (VOT) range, normalized by payload, for which the proposed hybrid IFTA would be preferable to the conventional air- and ocean-based IFTAs. Preliminary results suggest that this range of shipper VOT, normalized by payload, is between $0.6/ton-hour and $22.9/ton-hour, indicating a potential market for the proposed hybrid IFTA might exist. Additionally, sensitivity analyses reveal several interesting insights; most notably, the attractiveness of the proposed hybrid IFTA hinges on decreasing the distance VTOL aircraft transport freight between the logistics island and an onshore warehouse or transloading facility.}

The proposed research aims to evaluate a Decision Support System (DSS) for selecting the most appropriate logistic service provider out of three service providers companies. Three companies X1, X2 and X3 were weighted and ranked using two decision-making methods, namely Fuzzy best–worst​ Method (FBWM) and Multiple Objective Optimizations on the basis of Ratio Analysis plus full Multiplicative Form (MULTIMOORA), considering eight criteria and their corresponding sub-criteria, respectively. Once finished with constructing the decision matrix, the analytical data being obtained from the two methods were processed using Microsoft Excel and the Lingo software. According to the results, it is concluded that Company X3 is the best logistics service provider.}

A bi-level programming model was formulated to decide the optimal subsidy for intermodal transport to achieve the lowest carbon emissions while accounting for the cost minimization decisions faced by construction contractors who use prefabricated products. A numerical example was conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.

abstract = {The clustered generalized traveling salesman problem (CGTSP) is an extension of the classical traveling salesman problem (TSP), where the set of nodes is divided into clusters of nodes, and the clusters are further divided into subclusters of nodes. The objective is to find the minimal route that visits exactly one node from each subcluster in such a way that all subclusters of each cluster are visited consecutively. Due to the additional flexibility of the CGTSP compared to the classical TSP, CGTSP can incorporate a wider range of complexities arising from some practical applications. However, the absence of a good solution method for CGTSP is currently a major impediment in the use of the framework for modeling. Accordingly, the main objective of this paper is to enable the powerful framework of CGTSP for applied problems. To attain this goal, we first develop a solution method by an efficient transformation from CGTSP to TSP. We then demonstrate that not only the solution method provides far superior solution quality compared to existing methods for solving CGTSP, but also it enables practical solutions to far larger CGTSP instances. Finally, to illustrate that the modeling framework and the solution method apply to some practical problems of realistic sizes, we conduct a computational experiment by considering the application of CGTSP to two modern logistics problems; namely, automated storage and retrieval systems (logistics inside the warehouse) and drone-assisted parcel delivery service (logistics outside the warehouse).}

This paper proposes a novel energy management system (EMS) based on battery logistics by electric vessel to optimize the operation of pelagic islanded microgrid clusters (PIMGC). Firstly, the battery logistics among islanded microgrids and energy flow within islanded microgrids are modeled. Furthermore, an information gap decision theory-based EMS model is established with the uncertainties of renewable energy generators. Then, the Generalized Benders method is presented to decompose the scheduling problem into a master problem of discrete battery logistics optimization and subproblems of power flow feasibility checking. Finally, case studies with the proposed EMS are conducted with three islands in the South China Sea. The simulation results show that the proposed EMS is feasible and economical to supply energy for PIMGCs, providing a reference for the energy supply system of pelagic islands.}

abstract = {In the era of circular economies, governments and consumers are increasingly aware of environmental protection, which encourages enterprises to devote more attention to reverse logistics (RL). However, the limited resources and technical limitations of most manufacturing companies have motivated them to outsource their RL activities to professional third-party RL providers (3PRLPs). Optimal 3PRLP selection is instrumentally valuable in RL outsourcing practices because it has the potential to increase enterprises’ economic profitability and to improve their long-term development. Generally, 3PRLP selection is treated as a multiple-attribute decision-making (MADM) problem. To this end, this paper aims to build a multi-perspective MADM (MPMADM) framework to offer systematic decision support for enterprises to select the optimal 3PRLPs. Attribute assessments in the proposed framework take the form of generalized comparative linguistic expressions (GCLEs), which can be transformed into hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set (HFLTS) possibility distributions with semantic analysis in order to enhance information quality and reliability. Expert weights are then assigned in the use of an optimization model based on the correlation consensus measurement. Afterwards, the two-stage aggregation paradigm for computing with HFLTS possibility distributions is used to gather assessments at expert and attribute levels to compile overall assessments of each alternative 3PRLP. Compared with existing studies, our proposal considers environmental and social sustainability for attribute system establishment and introduces GCLEs for 3PRLP selection, which offer greater flexibility for experts to articulate their evaluations. In addition, the two-stage aggregation paradigm eliminates distortion and loss of information and provides decision makers with the capability to control the outcome’s precision. Moreover, the proposed expert weight determination approach is conducive to generating reliable weight vectors. Several illustrative examples, sensitivity analysis, and comparative analysis further demonstrate the flexibility and practicability of our proposal.}

In the past, studies have already described logistics sprawl in Paris Metropolitan area. These studies have concluded that logistic facilities far from Paris city center increased the distance travelled, and by extension, CO2 emissions. This study does not question logistics sprawl in Paris metropolitan area but questions its consequences. This study presents a point of view on the location of cross-docking terminals. One main parcel service carrier was studied through a database strong of 600,000 inputs including pick-ups and deliveries for two months in the Paris metropolitan area. This study is not intended to be representative of all merchandise flows but makes it possible to understand the running of one significant actor. This project aims at determining the optimum terminals location according to two criteria: minimization of the total distance as calculated by the Euclidean distance (as the crow flies) between terminals and points of pick-up/ delivery, and the number of authorized terminals. The number of terminals is modified to study its relationship with the spatial distribution of its clients. Interestingly, we found that optimized locations for this parcel service carrier are located outside of Paris city center. Those locations minimize the total distance to the clients, and thus, are the best places to limit pollution. The reason is that the carrier manages this perimeter through a polycentric organization. Paris Metropolitan area is viewed as several sectors and not as a whole for this carrier. It is therefore unknown how the carrier's performance has evolved over time, but its current organization is close to the optimal situation.}

abstract = {Many intra-logistics systems, such as automated container terminals, distribution warehouses, and cross-docks, observe parallel process flows, which involve simultaneous (parallel) operations of independent resources while processing a job. When independent resources work simultaneously to process a common job, the effective service requirement of the job is difficult to estimate. For modeling simplicity, researchers tend to assume sequential operations of the resources. In this paper, we propose an efficient modeling approach for parallel process flows using two-phase servers. We develop a closed queuing network model to estimate system performance measures. Existing solution methods can evaluate the performance of closed queuing networks that consist of two-phase servers with exponential service times only. To solve closed queuing networks with general two-phase servers, we propose new solution methods: an approximate mean value analysis and a network aggregation dis-aggregation approach. We derive insights on the accuracy of the solution methods from numerical experiments. Although both solution methods are quite accurate in estimating performance measures, the network aggregation dis-aggregation approach consistently performs best. We illustrate the proposed modeling approach for two intra-logistic systems: a container terminal with automated guided vehicles and a shuttle-based compact storage system. Results show that approximating the simultaneous operations as sequential operations underestimates the container terminal throughput on average by 28% and at maximum up to 47%. Similarly, considering sequential operations of the resources in the compact storage system results in an underestimation of the throughput capacity up to 9%.}

As automotive is one of the fastest-growing sectors, the number of ELVs to be collected and recycled has been steadily increasing due to more stringent regulations. On the other hand, the operational cost (transportation) of collecting ELVs might exceed half of the purchased price. Furthermore, parameters that influence the solution of the routing problem for the collection of ELVs tend to change due to the dynamic customers’ locations and variations in vehicle type and the condition of the vehicules at the end of their life. This research proposes a new reverse logistics routing problem for the collection of end-of-life vehicles. It combines the classical Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) with the pick-up problem and additional constraints such as loading pick-up sequences, time-windows, multi-trips, heterogeneous internal fleet, and external carriers. We also developed an efficient heuristic to construct routes and assign dealers to truck routes for solving large and real-size instances in a reasonable time. In collaboration with a significant player in North America for ELVs recycling, we performed a sensitivity analysis to compare the industry’s current practices and the proposed method. The validation process with different instances demonstrates results consistency and provides useful managerial insights. Finally, sensitivity analysis shows potential changes in the solution performance regarding the penalty cost of unused internal fleet, the extra broker cost, the size of ELVs collected, and the number of the internal carriers’ truck fleet.}

With the factors considered above this paper proposes a multi-objective logistics network model for the return products specifically pertaining to the Indian E-commerce market. The components of this multi-echelon supply chain considered are Customer Markets, Warehouses, Delivery Hubs, Landfills, Incineration Centres and Recycling Centres. The multi-objective optimization is done on the three fronts of sustainability, namely, economical, represented by cost, environmental, represented by environmental impact of different process, and social, which is represented by work days created and lost due to harms at work. Different technologies are considered in delivery hubs and mother warehouse which could result in a more efficient way of transferring and processing products. Weighted goal programming (WGP) technique is used by weighing different objectives to minimize cost, environment impact and maximize the social responsibility. Finally, - model is validated with a numerical example based on an online retail selling clothes.

Our research builds a Joint Distribution-Green Vehicle Routing Problem (JD-GVRP) model, in which cold chain logistics companies collaborate among each other to deliver cold chain commodities by considering carbon tax policy. Based on the real business data from four cold chain companies and 28 customers, a simulated annealing (SA) algorithm is applied to optimize the model. The results indicate that joint distribution is an effective way to reduce total costs and carbon emissions when compared with the single distribution. The total cost is positively correlated with the carbon price, while the carbon emissions vary differently when the carbon price increases. In addition, carbon quotas have no effect on the delivery path. This research expands cold chain logistics literature by linking it with joint distribution and carbon trading mechanisms. Moreover, this research suggests that cold chain logistics companies could enhance delivery efficiency, reduce the business cost, and improve competitiveness by reinforcing the collaboration at the industry level. Furthermore, the government should advocate the mode of joint distribution and formulate an effective carbon trading policy to better utilize social and industrial resources to achieve the balanced economic and environmental benefits.}

The proposed system takes advantage of outsourcing the last mile deliveries to a TPL provider and utilizing LUZs as temporary intermediate facilities instead of using permanent intermediate facilities to consolidate freight. A mathematical model and a simulated annealing (SA) algorithm are developed to solve the problem. The efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed SA heuristic are verified by testing it on existing benchmark instances. Computational results show that the performance of the proposed SA is comparable with that of another state-of-the-art algorithm. The model and algorithm are then used to design a two-echelon freight distribution system in Taipei City, Taiwan. Results of the case study indicate that the proposed model and algorithm provide a better distribution system.}

abstract = {The sugarcane harvest often requires migrant workers when there is insufficient supply of domestic workers or harvest machines. The recruitment of migrant workers is a long process, and the decision maker (DM) needs to determine the number of workers before the yield uncertainty is revealed. The prior distribution can be estimated from historical yields. During the sugarcane growing season, the DM can dynamically update the initial estimate of yield distribution. For this purpose, a stochastic logistics model with dynamic yield prediction is formulated. The model determines the flow of migrant workers from sources to sugarcane fronts in order to maximize the total expected contribution, subject to the worker availability constraint at each source. With respected to yield distribution, the expected contribution is defined as the expected revenue from green and burnt cane, minus the cost of labor, the cost of transporting workers from a source to a sugarcane front, and the cost of updating yield distribution. Under certain conditions, the optimization problem becomes convex programming, and a closed-form optimal solution can be obtained. In a general case, three heuristic solutions are proposed, and their performances are evaluated in a numerical example: The optimality gap is less than 0.07 percent in a small example. The proposed method is applied to a case study of sugarcane harvest in 46 provinces in Thailand. The monetary value of the dynamic yield prediction is found to be 1.9 million THB, which can be used to justify the investment in yield prediction and precision agriculture technology to reduce the variability of the agricultural yield.}

This paper presents a data-driven application of unsupervised machine learning clustering algorithms to a real-world case study in the automotive industry. The clustering input dataset collects the data available to a third-party logistics (3PL) provider. Clustering algorithms are used to define product families for the assignment of the workload to the processing resources. Several clustering algorithms (k-means, Gaussian mixture models and hierarchical clustering) define different product families scenarios using different tuning parameters. The impact of each clustering scenario on the operations is assessed via a dashboard of logistics KPIs to identify the best performing clustering algorithm. The performance of each clustering is, then, compared to a logistic benchmark given by a capacitated clustering to identify the best compromise between a logistic-constrained algorithm with a long runtime and fast data-driven uncapacitated algorithm.}

Motivated by beer industry, we formulate this problem based on two decision mechanisms: (1) PI-CR decision mechanism–sole consideration of component recovery (component recycling) (2) PI-RE decision mechanism–joint consideration of component recycling and emission control. In the PI-RE decision mechanism, two emission control policies—carbon tax and carbon cap & trade are implemented. Numerical analysis is demonstrated to show the application of the models, and the managerial implications are put forward. Results show that emission control and resource recycling strategies have different impacts on the decision, increasing the return rate of recoverable component is an effective approach to currently reduce emissions and cost, while the cap & trade policy is more effect than the carbon tax policy in controlling emissions.}

For this, a system dynamics (SD) simulation and a multi-criteria decision aid (MCDA) were applied to assess the sustainability performance of these distribution channel options for a case study of a local food cooperative and a logistics service provider in Austria. The sustainability potential of developing a new logistics system in collaboration with these players has been estimated for the first time, while considering the dynamic interplay of all relevant sustainability elements within operational, tactical, and strategic planning. The results show that an integration of the two players into a distributed network strategy based on a crowd logistics concept is the most viable and sustainable option. This highlights the significant role of the logistics sector in proactively innovating services to make sustainable choices easier for the customer.}

We present compact and extended mathematical models of the problem, where the extended model is based on generating all trips apriori. When solving the extended model we apply delayed constraint generation (DCG) to parts of the model to speed up the solution process. Computational results are presented that show that the extended formulation and solution method can solve realistic instances of the problem within one hour. The results further show that the DCG method works significantly better than using lazy constraints from a commercial solver, especially when the number of transportation tasks requiring temporal synchronization becomes large.}

Therefore, it is helpful for the healthy development of logistics finance to find out the related risks of each logistics financial risk event and screen and control them one by one. This paper proposes OntoLFR (Logistics Financial Risk Ontology), and constructs the logistics financial risk ontology model to adapt to the variability, complexity and relevance of risk in early warning and pre-control. Then, based on the risk source association inference rules obtained by knowledge association analysis, Apriori algorithm is adopted to conduct association analysis on the risk hidden danger database, and the acquired association rules are reintroduced into the knowledge ontology database of risk event source to realize self-learning and self-correction of the knowledge ontology database. Taking the risk event (RW_risk) of the financing enterprise to escape, the feasibility of using the logistics financial risk ontology model for risk-related reasoning and analysis is verified.}

The uncertainties considered in this study are the primary market return and secondary market demand.

Furthermore, due to the domination of informal businesses in many developing countries, environmental rules are not considered during operation, and these violations tend to affect public health adversely. The government in these developing countries finds it difficult to manage and utilize e-waste due to insufficient resources properly. The existing performance measures are only appropriate for implementation in developed countries with the inability to assess informal e-waste businesses in developing countries. Therefore, to address this gap, this research proposes sustainable reverse logistics scorecards (SRLS) to identify informal e-waste businesses' performance. Data were obtained through in-depth interviews with eleven experts, questionnaire survey with one hundred eighty-six informal e-waste businesses in Indonesia using the snowball sampling method and by measurement identification using the statistical descriptive analysis such as mean, geometric mean, mode, and sign-test median including experts' confirmation. The results showed that there are twenty-two parameters from six perspectives namely financial, stakeholders' value, internal business processes, innovation and growth, environment, and social. These parameters can be used as a performance measurement following government regulation and adjusting the motivation, strategy, capability, and activities of informal e-waste businesses. They are also useful for practical assessment and decision purposes, such as process safety and economic impact evaluation of businesses with the ability to create job opportunities, satisfy employees, and provide persuasive incentives. The balance between environment, welfare, and e-waste management is realized through SRLS. We suggested that other researchers use these parameters to assess the performance of informal e-waste throughout Indonesia and the government considered these parameters to assess them before deciding to collaborate for handling e-waste problems.}

However, incomplete information usually exists in logistics enterprise coalitions. Therefore, some eminent point-valued solutions of cooperative games appear powerless, such as the Shapley value and the Banzhaf value. They just apply to the cooperative games where all coalitional values could be estimated in advance. This work concerns the issue of profit allocation for collaborative coalitions with incomplete information and develops several profit allocation schemes for logistics enterprise coalitions. First, based on the own profits of the collaborative logistics enterprises and their contributions to the collaborative coalition, a quadratic programming model is developed as a baseline model. Next, the baseline model is extended by taking account of the weights of the collaborative logistics enterprises. Some important properties of the solutions proposed in this paper, such as the efficiency, existence, symmetry, and anonymity, are apparent. One algorithm, if necessary, is described to make them satisfy the property of individual rationality. Through three numerical scenarios and an actual case in the logistics service industry, the advantages of the solutions proposed in this paper are demonstrated.}

For comparison purposes, the series, parallel, and series-parallel hybrid powertrain system are examined by dynamic programming (DP) algorithm using the same vehicular parameters. The approach of adaptive EMS is driving pattern recognition (DPR) to obtain optimum estimation of EMS parameters under different driving cycle. A back propagation (BP) neural network DPR optimized model by an improved genetic algorithm (IGA) has been proposed. Taking the costs of fuel consumption, the parameters of the fuzzy logic controller (FLC) and equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS) are optimized. The comparative results show that the series PHELV fuel economy improvements are 7.60% and 6.53%, compared with parallel and series-parallel PHELV. The difference between the optimal fuzzy energy management strategy and the global optimization is 4.74%, and the ECMS is 4.66%.}

It is discrete and dynamic due to the random arrival of materials, the changing state of moving vehicles and production equipment. Besides, with the increasing manufacturing shop scale, the production process and equipment continuous updating, PL system is required to have a strong adaptability. These characteristics make production logistics scheduling issues particularly important and complex. In this article, a framework of multi-agent based production logistics system with real-time intelligent decision-making capability is presented. The decision-making mainly involves two aspects, one is the issue of order dispatch, and the other is the path selection problem of AGV. Based on the summary of the existing models and algorithms, this paper analyzes the production logistics function and divides the PL system into seven agents, namely Task agent, Capability Database agent, Guide Path agent, Environment Database agent, AGV agent, Monitor agent and Management agent. This framework simplifies the structure of the PL system and reduces the complexity of the PL control. It is expected that various agent interactions will enable the problem of task assignment and path selection in PL to be well resolved. Moreover, due to the generality of the problems in the logistics, the modularity and low customization features of this framework make it possible to be well encapsulated in Product Service System (PSS) which serves as a third party to support the factory.}

In this problem, two types of fleets are available to serve customers, city freighters and occasional drivers (ODs), while two delivery options are available to customers, home delivery and alternative delivery. For customers choosing the alternative delivery, their demands are delivered to one of the available covering locations for them to pick up. The objective of 2E-VRPTW-CO-OD is to minimize the total cost consisting of routing costs, connection costs, and compensations paid to ODs while satisfying all demands. We formulate a mixed integer linear programming model and propose an effective adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) for solving 2E-VRPTW-CO-OD. In addition, the proposed ALNS provides comparable results with those obtained by state-of-the-art algorithms for the two echelon vehicle routing problem, which is a special case of 2E-VRPTW-CO-OD. Lastly, the effects of occasional drivers and covering locations are presented.}

Increasingly, the logistics industry is implementing the Internet-of-Things (IoT), namely sensors and actuators, to collect data, process orders and deliver materials and/or products. This automation reduces human errors in processing orders and enhances the efficiency of order deliveries. However, this can be interrupted by attacks from cyberspace, especially from the Internet. In this paper, we propose a novel attacker–defender model against a quantal response (QR) adversary to protect critical assets by considering the defending budget and the asset dependency. Each asset in the solution is represented by its security level indicating its desirability for being protected. Due to the non-convexity of our model, we propose a Method of Successive Average heuristic with randomised initial conditions (MSAR) to obtain a promising solution.}

This paper starts from a study that has been performed at a multinational corporation which manufactures fiber-reinforced plastic boxes and cabinets with doors, where the final product-storage area and the picking section frequently become overloaded. In addition, warehouse operators do not follow standardized procedures and usually carry out too many movements to complete their tasks. Finally, there is not a suitable daily logistics planning system to make sure that capacity and demand are in balance. This paper proposes a solution to this problem by means of a Methods-Time Measurement (MTM) study as well as a daily workload planner to control short-term logistical operations. Thanks to the implementation of this system, the company has been able to plan the day-to-day workload in an accurate way and to precisely determine the necessary resources for the picking and shipping orders. Moreover, the company has gained flexibility in order to better match demand and capacity and has experimented significant cost savings and a better delivery service to its customers.}

Starting from a headquarter multiple tours are to be executed simultaneously by groups of harvesting units (HUs) and support units (SUs) to first harvest biomass from multiple agricultural fields, before supplying the biomass to multiple biogas plants (BPs) via shuttling SUs. This problem is relevant on a larger scale in particular for contractors. This problem is complex since there are three interconnected optimisation levels: (i) the assignment of BPs to tours and the ordering of BPs assigned to each tour, (ii) the assignment of fields to BPs and the ordering of fields assigned to each BP, and (iii) determining the number of HUs and SUs assigned to each tour, whereby different HUs and SUs may in general have different working rates and loading capacities. Problem modeling and a solution method are discussed. For the latter, a GPU-accelerated heuristic search algorithm is proposed. For the former, an optimisation criterion minimising both total accumulated path length and the maximum completion time over all harvesters tours, an embedded local minimisation for the assignment of SUs to tours, and demand fulfilment constraints for BPs are discussed. In stochastic simulation experiments it is found that permitting unconstrained assignment of any available field that a contractor services to any available BP, independent of their ownerships, is crucial (i) to attain maximum path length savings, and (ii) also to best balance and minimise uniform completion times over all harvesters tours such that weather-dependent harvesting windows can be exploited optimally.}

The result is an increase in parcels shipped to consumers’ homes, challenging urban freight systems in terms of efficiency and sustainability. Many measures exist, that aim to optimise and improve activities of logistics service providers in urban areas. However, research on the parcel market and its actors is limited, so it is unclear how parcel distribution is organised and which city logistics measures are (not) adopted. This information is needed to re-think parcel distribution and support policy-making that sustains and improves urban sustainability and quality of life. Therefore, we carried out case-study research with focus on Brussels, Belgium’s largest city and capital. Findings demonstrate that logistics service providers are focused on measures that improve distribution efficiency, which is determined by parcel volume, stop density, delivery failure and urban regulation. To this end, pick-up points and lockers and tools to affect receiver behaviour are implemented most. Generally, Brussels’ parcel distribution market is dominated by conventional vehicles and traditional modes of operation, but regulations and policies are advancing the use of micro-hubs in combination with cargo-bikes. Local authorities can facilitate adoption of city logistics measures for parcel distribution by cooperating and exchanging information with the private sector and by developing a harmonised, long-term vision on freight transport policy across cities and regions.}

By determining the optimal flow of products using a Chance Constrained Robust Stochastic Programming (CCRSP), it is highlighted how the number of plant openings is influenced by the changes in carbon credit price. To assess the model performance, a set of numerical experiments in different sizes are developed and conducted. The effectiveness of the results are then compared to a proposed Heuristic Hybrid Taguchi PSO (HTPSO) solution algorithm, which underlines the effectiveness of the model. A sensitivity analysis on the carbon emission rate is carried out which underlines the role of Carbon Tax Policy. Finally, a real-life case study within the automotive manufacturing industry is carried out by applying the developed robust stochastic model. From a practical standpoint, the model can potentially be employed to meet the carbon credits that are used for handling the different carbon prices and trade scenarios. Also, it provides insights on how to better manage uncertainties, as well as to reduce the overall emissions in supply chains.}

However, the widespread availability of commercial truck GPS data comes with a large diversity of sources with different operational characteristics. In this context, motivated by addressing ongoing challenges in urban logistics from the perspective of transport geography, we describe an approach to exploring and analyzing a large amount of vehicle GPS data from heterogeneous sources. Our aim is to leverage GPS data to better understand and characterize urban logistics from a broader, city-wide perspective as well as from the perspective of a single corporate logistics system. Using the city of São Paulo, Brazil, as an example, we show how such data can be leveraged to improve the operational planning of transport operators and the policymaking strategies of public agencies, especially in cities in developing and emerging economies where other sources of data are not readily available. We build on GPS data from company-specific logistics fleets as well as company-agnostic, mixed-use general vehicle fleets to present novel insights into the spatial distribution of cargo vehicles across the city on different days, the distinct flows and preferred paths of freight traffic, the number of stops per vehicle trip, the distribution of stop times, and the speed patterns. Our proposed approach can easily be transferred and extended to other geographic contexts and other datasets that exhibit structures similar to those used in our case study.}

The objective is to minimize the total cost, which includes both fixed and variable costs. The fixed cost occurs when the drayage truck is incurred in integrating transportation, and the variable cost is generated per travel distance increment. By dividing customers into different subsets and proposing a special penalty matrix, we provide an intelligent model that integrates the internal and external container transportation problems. A customized genetic algorithm is proposed. Based on the instances of real-life data on 888 orders, the results show that our approach can reduce the overall cost by 16.8%.}

Accordingly, alternative transportation systems are essential to maximize fairness and minimize the total transportation time, simultaneously. However, little study has reported on this issue for humanitarian logistics. To address it, a bi-objective stochastic optimization model is proposed to rebalance and transport commodities with the multi-modal transportation system. This work first linearizes the model and then applies an adaptive augmented E-constraint method to obtain a number of Pareto-optimal solutions. Furthermore, a case study of an emergency event is carried out, of which the computational results indicate its decision making effectiveness. Lastly, sensitivity analysis on critical parameters is conducted and the trade-off between the objectives is also analyzed to provide valuable managerial insights.}

The results were triangulated in order to show different perspectives unveiled by the research sources and methods. The analysis of results was carried out based on content analysis proposed by Bardin (1977), in which categories were defined a priori and adjusted a posteriori. The main results show that the concept of circular economy, although not formally expressed in the Brazilian law and sectoral agreement, guides the actions developed by the signatories of the agreement.

With the help of delivery robots, considerable operational time savings can be achieved by dispatching robots to serve nearby customers while a driver is also serving a customer. We provide a mathematical model for the VRPTWDR and investigate the challenges and benefits of using delivery robots as assistants for city logistics. A two-stage matheurisitic algorithm is developed to solve medium scale VRPTWDR instances.

ILSP contains two main phases including initial logistics solution generation and iterative logistics solution improvement based on the intelligence and knowledge from domain experts. Several algorithms and strategies are designed in ILSP for package partitioning, route planning and quality improvement. From the view of expert systems, the significance and impact of ILSP are simultaneously taking both computational efficiency and iterative quality improvement based on the expert knowledge into account on logistics planning problem with pickup and delivery.

Thus, to maximize the robustness decision utility, decision-makers need to make a trade-off between relative robustness against uncertain situations and the price of such robustness. In this paper, we argue that facility capacity acquisition can improve the robustness of the network. We use a robust optimization method to establish the decision-making model for this problem, and propose a way to prove the model’s effectiveness in providing a lower bound of network robustness. Then the study takes on a real case in the Chongming district of Shanghai, China, and conducts a Monte Carlo simulation to investigate the trade-off performance. The results show that based on the decision-maker’s conservative attitude toward uncertain situations, the proposed model can adjust the robustness of the reverse logistics network. They also show that accepting a lower degree of robustness will result in substantial savings, due to the high “price” of robustness. This study provides a decision tool to help design a robust reverse logistics network under uncertain situations.}

abstract = {Decision-making for shelter location-allocation influences the success of disaster response and affects the security of victims. This paper proposes a multi-objective optimization model for determining shelter location-allocation in response to humanitarian relief logistics. Three objective functions are formulated to improve both efficiency and effectiveness. The first objective is to minimize total costs, including fixed costs for opening the shelters, transportation costs, and service costs. The second objective is to minimize the total time for evacuating victims from all affected areas to allocated shelters. The third objective is to minimize the number of shelters required to provide thorough service to victims. The Epsilon Constraint method (EC) and Goal Programming (GP) are employed for solving the proposed model. The applicability of the proposed model is validated through a case study of flooding in Surat Thani, Thailand. The Pareto efficiency obtained from solving the proposed model is compared with current shelter location-allocation plans determined by the government sector. The comparisons reveal that the results obtained from solving the proposed model outperform current shelter location-allocation plans. Furthermore, the results of this study could provide an advantage to decision-makers considering appropriate strategies for disaster response.}

As a diversified industrial cluster, SLEC faces a complex internal and external environment, which makes high sustainable risks threatens the survival of SLEC members. To reduce the risks of SLEC, we first identify three kinds of risk factors, namely, the risks of SLEC members, technology risks, and external environmental risks. Then we adopt social network analysis (SNA) to construct a research framework for analyzing the relationships among risk factors of SLEC. Based on the results of the SNA, we further build a risk evaluation system based on the improved technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method to evaluate the risks of different SLECs and achieve better global optimal risk control. Moreover, we use a case study of RRS logistics company to verify our research framework and evaluation system. The results show that, in the RRS home appliance SLEC, the risks of technological route change, government management risks, and industry management risks can easily lead to the generation of other risks, while external stakeholder risk, government management risk and internal stakeholder risk are easily induced by other risks. Besides, among the home appliance, fitness, and fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) SLECs of RRS logistics company, when in-node degree and out-node degree risks have the same weight, the risks of the home appliance SLEC are the lowest, while that of the FMCG SLEC are the highest.}

Trends such as population growth and aging, liveable cities, infrastructure resilience, and changes in land use patterns are reshaping how people and goods move across urban areas. In Norway, local authorities are primarily responsible for facilitating these trends by incorporating related issues into their planning processes. In contrast to personal travel, freight transport and logistics have been neglected by local authorities in urban planning. Thus, in order to address freight transport in decision-making processes, local authorities need to have an increased understanding of urban freight and to pay more attention to freight transport and city logistics. The aim of the paper is to understand the potential for coordinated logistics planning at the local level. Interviews were held with representatives of public authorities and private stakeholders within the logistics supply chain in three Norwegian cities. It is necessary for local authorities to understand stakeholders' operations, perspectives, and attitudes in order to ensure that their involvement in urban planning will be constructive. The findings show that there are no overall strategies for urban freight or city logistics in the studied cities, although public authorities are concerned with issues related to urbanisation and sustainability that indirectly affect freight deliveries. Furthermore, there is poor capacity in planning and policymaking regarding freight. Local authorities comprise a number of fragmented departments and appear to lack resources dedicated to urban freight. However, such authorities realise the need for their contribution in the process of establishing urban logistics plans.}

The main challenges of operations in these regions arise due to their remoteness and extreme weather conditions. These conditions also put major challenges to plan emergency logistics support, which is currently offered either by helicopters or marine vessels. This paper analyzes the risk-based marine logistics support model in an offshore facility operating in the far northern (sub-arctic) region. A Bayesian network (BN) approach is used to develop the risk model considering interdependencies and conditional relationships among the contributing factors. Exploration in the Flemish Pass Basin located offshore Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, is selected as a case study to demonstrate the methodology. The study identifies the critical elements of a marine logistics operation that need attention to reduce its associated risk. The corresponding safety measures are identified and implemented into the risk model. Appropriate risk management strategies are proposed to support marine logistics operations.}

To solve this issue, we establish a theoretical model with multiple principals (express companies) and a common agency (LML provider). We find that the optimal ex ante contract among collusive principals is a profit-sharing contract, which ensures that the principals have no motivation to take hidden actions to influence the agency’s workload division. We also provide the optimal incentive contract between the coalition and the agency.}

However, the data used in the existing literature are usually based on surveys or small samples, resulting in inaccurate research results, and most studies generally ignore the spatial heterogeneity of shippers who uses cross-border logistics service and individual preference differences. Taking the international trade between China, Myanmar and Vietnam as an example, and considering the geographical spatial characteristics of various factors, we analyze how geographical factors affect the cross-border logistics routes choice. By using the conditional logit model, the influence of geographical factors on the land POEs and sea POEs cross-border logistics routes choice is compared. The results show that there are significant differences in the characteristics and their influencing factors, which are reflected in the scale of freight, transportation distance, duration, transportation expense, infrastructure quality, geographical location and characteristics of the shippers and POEs. The distance equivalent tool is introduced to calculate the competition balance point of the sea/road POE. The impact mechanism of cross-border logistics choice of land POEs and sea POEs cross-border logistics is explored. Finally, according to the spatial differences of POEs, policy suggestions are proposed.}

However, the involvement of different processes and facilities across the RL value chain makes it difficult to visualize and manage the whole process conveniently. Consequently, issues such as inadequate assessment of environmental hazards, unclear cost accrual patterns, misleading information to stakeholders, and other process-related deficiencies arise, thereby questioning the overall sustainability and alike circularity concepts. Despite the prominent role of lean management (LM) concepts in process improvements across various product-oriented sectors, its integration within RL management to solve ICW problems is almost non-existent. This paper presents a unique lean thinking-based multi-layer value stream assessment (MVSA) approach deriving from a conventional value stream mapping (VSM) technique to assess the overall RL network of ICW management. RL network design entails both facility-based and non-facility-based processes, with four different value streams, i.e., time, cost, environmental quality, and process efficiency aspects. A case study of Hong Kong demonstrates the developed MVSA approach. The case study features an assessment of the RL network's current and future states, considering multiple scenarios. Furthermore, a detailed sensitivity analysis is conducted to provide valuable insights and discussions. In the end, an agenda for continuous improvement related to the proposed MVSA approach is expounded. The research findings verify that the proposed MVSA approach can significantly contribute to the overall process improvement, better visualization, and RL network assessment, leading to effective waste management systems.}

abstract = {Background
The pharmaceutical supply chain management system of Ethiopia has several problems including non-availability, poor storage, weak stock management and irrational use. However, few studies were conducted on progress and challenges towards implementation of Integrated Pharmaceuticals Logistics System (IPLS) in the study area. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the progress and challenges towards the implementation of IPLS in selected health facilities of Wollega zones, Western Ethiopia.
Methods
A cross sectional quantitative and qualitative study was conducted in selected health facilities from February 15 to March 15, 2015. The calculated sample size was 31 health facilities with 20% margin of error and 90% confidence interval (CI). The Logistics Indicator Assessment Tool (LIAT) was used to collect information from selected health facilities; while an in-depth interview was held with chief pharmacist to collect qualitative data. Correlation and multiple linear regression analysis were used at significance level of 90%CI.
Results
The average availability of bin cards for the selected products was 83.9% for hospitals, 75.4% for health centers, and 70.6% for health posts. On average, hospitals had an updated bin card for 43.8% of the product while health centers and health posts had an updated bin card for 32.9% and 32% of their products, respectively. On average the exact accuracy of request and resupply form (RRF) data for hospital and health center was 45.6% and 37.1%, respectively. IPLS implementation was related with health facility stores infrastructures (40.1%), Logistics Management Information System/LMIS/ (32.2%), stock availability and status (31.9%), storage condition (17.7%) and order fill rate (14.1%). Multivariable regression revealed LMIS (std. β = 2.539, p = 0.022), stock status (std. β = 0.848, p = 0.049) and availability of tracer medicines (std. β = 0.212, p = 0.013) were positively associated with IPLS implementation.
Conclusion
There have been significant improvements in supply chain indicators in the availability of essential health commodities since IPLS has been implemented, with some variation by level of facility and product type. Involvement of all stakeholders is necessary to sustain the system. Additionally, there needs to be more focus on monitoring and evaluation of IPLS including more focused studies.}

The courier must decide which TCs to select for the service in order to minimize the total cost and maximize the total service quality. We show that the problem can be modeled as a new packing problem, the Generalized Bin Packing Problem with bin-dependent item profits (GBPPI), where the items are the parcels to deliver and the bins are the TCs. The aim of the GBPPI is to select the appropriate fleet from TCs and determine the optimal assignment of parcels to vehicles such that the overall net cost is minimized. This cost takes into account both transportation costs and service quality. We provide a Mixed Integer Programming formulation of the problem, which is the starting point for the development of efficient heuristics that can address the GBPPI for instances involving up to 1000 items. Extensive computational tests show the accuracy of the proposed methods. Finally, we present a last-mile logistics case study of an international courier which addresses this problem.}

We believe that expansion is a double-edged sword. Economy of scale can have negative aspects associated with it. This study analyzes how transportation size affects competitiveness in the logistics industry. Additionally, we discuss other determinants of logistics performance such as ICT capability and green transportation.

In the view of specific problem, a Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) algorithm is designed to solve this MIP model effectively. Numerical experiments based on different sizes of instances are implemented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Computational results indicate that the proposed model reduces carbon emissions by about 46.93% compared to the dispatching rule. Moreover, the consideration of barge transshipment in the model can reduce carbon emissions by about 10.46%. In addition, the VNS algorithm yields solutions with optimality gaps about 0.29% in a short time.}

abstract = {This paper focuses on the export container cargos from Chongqing to Europe in the outbound transport network, considering the two modes of maritime transport and the CSERE (Chongqing-Sinkiang-Europe Railway Express). It has three aims: first, to propose a method to calculate the international transport accessibility with the help of indicators of the convenience and connectivity of the outbound transport; second, to estimate the container cargo volume changes as the CSERE develops, extending the linear expenditure system model and the multiregional input-output model, combined with the stochastic frontier analysis and the multifactor dynamic coefficient generation; and third, to evaluate the effects of the CSERE on the formation of the CILC (Chongqing International Logistics Center) by employing three indicators, i.e., the international transport level, the industry diversity and the CSERE contribution rate. Managerial and policy implications of promoting the CILC are drawn from the test results.}

The decision model was applied and tested in a longitudinal case study of a city logistics initiative in Sweden with ten stakeholders. The data were collected included semi-structured interviews and surveys with the stakeholders, participant observation and archival records. The results were analysed using a multi-criteria decision model, which utilises the analytic hierarchy process to rank alternative goals and their importance. The proposed multi-criteria decision model provides a structured approach to managing the multiple stakeholders in city logistics and their goals. The model helps to identify the overall goals that need the most attention and which of these goals need to be considered for each stakeholder and to what extent. This paper offers a multi-criteria decision model for stakeholder management in city logistics, something that is lacking in the literature.}

abstract = {As one of the most prevailing retail channels, E-commerce has nowadays facilitated retailers to sell goods to customers worldwide and tremendously increased the supply chain efficiency by removing most intermediate links. The broaden business scope and accelerated goods circulation, nevertheless, have generally led to capital shortages for retailers, especially small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Given the SMEs’ difficulty in acquiring capital from financial institutions such as banks, logistics finance (LF) has emerged as an alternative, which is the combination of logistics and financial service. However, the frequent order fulfillment and diversity of pledges in E-commerce hinder SMEs in meeting LF's financing requirements. Furthermore, the current LF relies more on large and reputable third-party logistics (3PLs) to alleviate financing risks, which in turn raises the entry threshold for other 3PLs. Hence, this paper has proposed a blockchain-enabled logistics finance execution platform (BcLFEP) as an integrated solution to facilitate LF for E-commerce retail. A cross-layered architecture is proposed to organize and manage involved resources, workflows and decisions based on the object-oriented methodology (OOM). A hybrid finite state machine-based smart contract (HFSM-SC) is designed to associate and coordinate with all kinds of agents for LF operations throughout its lifecycle. Moreover, blockchain is integrated with agent technology to construct a blockchain-enabled multi-agent system (BcMAS), providing a trusted runtime environment to more autonomously and efficiently execute smart contract. Finally, a case study is conducted to implement BcLFEP-enabled dynamic pledge management for verification and evaluation.}

Therefore, we introduce a new green logistics solution for last-mile deliveries considering synchronization between e-vans and e-cargo bikes, developed as a Two-Echelon Electric Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows and Partial Recharging (2E-EVRPTW-PR). The first echelon represents an urban zone, and the second echelon represents a restricted traffic zone (e.g., historical center) in which e-vans in the first and e-cargo bikes in the second echelon are used for customers’ deliveries. The proposed 2E-EVRPTW-PR model aims to minimize the total costs in terms of travel costs, initial vehicles’ investment costs, drivers’ salary costs, and micro-depot cost. The effectiveness of the proposed solution has been demonstrated comparing two different cases, i.e., the EVRPTW-PR considering e-vans for the first case, and the 2E-EVRPTW-PR considering e-vans and e-cargo bikes for the second case. The comparison has been carried out on existing EVRPTW-PR instances for the first case, and on novel 2E-EVRPTW-PR instances for the second case, in which customers of initial EVRPTW-PR instances have been divided into two zones (urban and restricted traffic zones) by using Fuzzy C-mean clustering. Moreover, results encourage logistics companies to adopt zero-emission strategies for last-mile deliveries, especially in restricted traffic zones.}

abstract = {This paper focuses on the spatial patterns of freight and logistics activities in Metropolitan Canada. The literature acknowledges that these activities, while fundamentally important to economic and social wellbeing in cities, also contribute negatively to aspects of urban life through their associated vehicular traffic for example. The at times sprawling nature of their pattern (Dablanc, Ogilvie, & Goodchild, 2014; Dablanc & Ross, 2012), driven by industry desires for larger footprints, can further exacerbate these negatives. However, the existence of sprawl is not common in all major centres, with local variations in influencing factors interacting with systematic developments in the logistics industry (e.g. larger facilities). The objectives of this paper are to analyse the pattern of logistics developments in Canadian cities and to explore the factors influencing the observed patterns. The methodology employs a case study approach (building on the authors previous work on the Greater Toronto Area - (Woudsma, Jakubicek, & Dablanc, 2015), obtaining fine-grained spatial data on logistics businesses and their employment levels across selected Canadian cities including Vancouver, Calgary, Montreal, Winnipeg and Halifax. The data used to assess these patterns were business listings from DMTI spatial, a Canadian provider of geospatial data. The data set used in this paper contains listings of business names, addresses, SIC codes in 2002, and NAICS and SIC codes in 2012. For analysis of this data, our approach uses basic spatial indicators, like mean centre of establishments and average distance to mean centre, along with statistical analysis of facility types and intra-regional changes. The exploration of influencing factors is conducted through in-depth review of industry publications, regional news sources, and conversations with experts in the commercial development industry in each case study city. Preliminary results indicate that in smaller metropolitan areas (Winnipeg, Halifax), the land supply pressures, and scope of logistics developments result in no evidence of sprawl. In the remaining cities, there is moderate evidence of sprawl, with noted influences including supply and local development controls. These results are discussed in the context of the current literature on urban logistics sprawl with directions for future work provided.}

abstract = {This paper aims to investigate the supply chain and reverse channels of expanded polystyrene packaging connection in Brazil and their roles to discuss the main challenges towards circular economy. In order to achieve this goal, we propose a four-step method, anchored in the literature, technical visits, and interviews with experts in the expanded polystyrene (EPS) industry. First, the EPS supply chain was characterised and mapped, and secondly, the stakeholders and logistics activities in reverse channels were analysed. Third, the Brazilian legislation and chain structure was reviewed to obtain an understanding of how this can influence the activities developed in reverse channels. Fourth, with an analysis of the data collected before, the barriers to implement EPS reverse chain were presented. The main results establish that the EPS can complete one cycle of the circular economy, which is recycling, but products need to be separated and washed. The most significant waste generators are public and private institutions, residences, and retailers. Notable barriers to its recycling are a lack of understanding of the nature of expanded polystyrene recycling by Brazilian people, high transport cost due to material density, and the dispersion of post-consumer expanded polystyrene in several regions of the country linked with the small number of recycling facilities. Finally, this issue could be explored in industries and companies that require their managers to adopt strategies to improve reverse logistics in order to promote the circular economy. The companies’ actions could facilitate a stronger circular supply chain since they could increase recycling efforts, reduce expanded polystyrene waste, and present new business models. The resulting generation of employment would contribute to the quality of life of contemporary society. The findings presented in the paper enable industries to identify and guide the most demanding significant steps and processes, and to shift the reverse chain and expanded polystyrene recycling to ensure that they operate more efficiently.}

abstract = {In a circular economy, an enterprise should pursue long-term business and economic opportunities for environmental and societal benefits. One of the critical issues in industries with a circular economy is the development of the reverse logistics system for semi-finished product packaging and shipping. There are several challenges while designing this system; for example, the use of reusable semi-finished product shipping boxes and a logistics system for shipping the products and returning these boxes. In this research, under the context of global manufacturing, a logistics system for reusable semi-finished product packaging in LCD panel industry is studied. The cost models of semi-finished product packaging in a traditional logistics mode and a green logistics mode are introduced. In the green logistics mode, the shipping boxes are redesigned to be reusable and capable of accommodating multiple various-sized panels simultaneously. The cost models involve material cost, shipping, and recycling cost. The economic performances of the traditional and green logistics modes at different package recycling levels are analyzed. The results show that the total cost of the green logistics mode is beneficial, always lower than that of the traditional logistics mode, even at a low recycling rate (30%). In addition, in the green mode, the material cost of shipping boxes is the most influential sector of the total cost.}

The model explicitly takes into account the number of people without healthcare attention, relief aid, and shelter support. We build a function that represents the total number of people at risk of not receiving proper humanitarian assistance using a bi-objective approach in which expected logistics costs are also minimized. The benefit of our approach is assessed through real flood cases in Mexico in which GIS analysis was used to enhance data gathering and to provide risk maps that could be potentially used by policy-makers in practical settings. The overall results suggest that sheltering decisions have to be closely coordinated with the management of material and human resources to avoid an increased number of people deprived of attention and relief aid. The Pareto Frontier also reveals that some solutions exhibit a quite interesting trade-off, e.g., it is possible to improve the overall relief assistance by almost 17% at the expense of less than 14% in the logistics costs.}

Many platform-based enterprises are facing difficulties in operating that resulting in inefficient resource allocation, high costs and top-down centralized decision-making process so that unsustainable on-demand delivery is an existing challenge. Such a platform service supply chain is highly influenced by fluctuating supply and demand. To solve this problem, this paper introduces an online double auction for on-demand pickup and delivery in the metropolitan cities, allowing both shippers and carriers dynamically enter and exit transactions. A multi-agent environment is created to automate the real-time auctioning through cyber-physical-system technologies. The proposed method aims at maximizing the social welfare and minimizing trade failures in the face of uncertainty of future agent types or the information of further bids and asks. The approach is extending the well-known McAfee's single-unit method, to allocate multi-unit on-demand logistics tasks using public, private, robot-enabled delivery capacities. It is observed that truthful bidding is a dominant strategy for each agent under this mechanism while realizing budget balance and individual rationality. The results show that the designed auction is more suitable to employ if supply-demand unbalance exists, compared with the fixed pricing mechanism. It suggests using more crowdsourcing resources rather than private carriers to improve transaction efficiency and transportation sustainability.}

But affiliate mode has emerged many drawbacks that can aggravate the divergence of interests between franchisees and headquarter and then leads to the problem of franchisee loss. In this paper, the franchisee loss problem is studied from the perspective of vulnerability. The loss of a franchisee is seen as a node that has been attacked. The performance change before and after an attack is used to reflect the strength of a network’s vulnerability. Efficacy and efficiency are proposed to measure the performance change based on NK model, which specializes in studying complex adaptive system such as logistics network. Results show that efficacy and efficiency vary according to network scale. For relatively small networks, their efficacy shows more obvious fluctuation with the variation of network scale than efficiency does. In these networks, the redundancy of network nodes is high. But the percentage of redundant nodes decreases with the increase of scale and the efficacy can be improved with the reduction of redundant nodes. The network structure of them is not stable. As for relatively large networks, efficiency fluctuates more apparently with the change of complexity than efficacy does. In these networks, most nodes are influential and the percentage of influential nodes shows obvious change with complexity. The network structure tends to be stable. In conclusion, the study on the influence of franchisee loss from vulnerability can provide us with greater visibility and insight into the organization structure of logistics networks. Corresponding cases are introduced to confirm our conclusions.}
