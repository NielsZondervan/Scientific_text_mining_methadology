This important issue has prompted airport ground handling service (AGHS) companies in Taiwan to enhance convenient services for passengers and to invest in airport logistics center expansion plans (ALCEP) to broaden the AGHS market. Due to their budgetary restrictions, AGHS companies need to outsource many of their services to contractors to implement these plans. This study proposes an ALCEP solution procedure to guide AGHS companies in adjusting their priority goals and selecting the best contractor according to their needs. This proposed procedure successfully solves the ALCEP problem and facilitates the assignment of contractors by considering both qualitative and quantitative methods.}

abstract = {The Brazilian Petroleum Regulatory Agency (ANP) regulates the use of biodiesel in fuel oil throughout Brazil. Current laws require that from 2017, diesel oil must contain 8% biodiesel (i.e., B8). In fact, the bus fleets of some Brazilian regions already use the B20 blend (20% biodiesel) as fuel. The objective of this work was to analyse the costs and logistics of biodiesel production from mixtures of used cooking oils in the Metropolitan Region of Campinas (RMC, São Paulo State, Brazil). Cooking oils collected from MRC homes were mixed with ethanol in various proportions and transesterified at 60 °C for 30 or 90 min, in order to obtain biodiesel, using NaOH as a catalyst. The results of the physical and chemical analyses demonstrated that the biodiesels so obtained possessed characteristics close to those required by Brazilian standards. This fuel could be used in fleets of buses, trucks and machines, or even sold to fuel distributors; and would be worth 15.784 million USD/year. Thus, MRC would gain environmental credits and become a sustainable city. As part of a logistical planning proposal to collect used cooking oils during household garbage collection in MRC, an idea was presented for a reservoir attached to garbage trucks. Two or more companies might work together to create a competitive advantage and higher profits than could be achieved by unitary action. The biodiesel industrial plant must be placed in Barão Geraldo District, which is near a petroleum refinery in Paulínia as well as highways of national importance and pharmaceutical industries. The reduction of more than 20% in all emissions of greenhouse gases and particulate matter has been proven since implementation of the current policy requiring the use of biodiesel in the region's bus fleet.}

With this mechanism, several carriers form an alliance and exchange some of their transportation requests for the purpose of gaining more profits. In the CE, each carrier plays a double role of buyer and seller. This characteristic brings some advantages compared with traditional Combinatorial Auctions (CA) in freight logistics. A 0-1 linear programming is formulated for this problem. A Lagrangian relaxation approach is then developed to solve the CE problem. The relaxed problem is transformed into a maximum vertex weight clique problem (MVWCP) which is solved either by a multi-neighborhood tabu search or by a commercial MIP solver. A repair heuristic is proposed to cope with any infeasibilities caused by the constraint relaxation. Extensive numerical experiments on randomly generated instances show that the Lagrangian relaxation approach can provide high quality solutions.}

The average nitrogen oxides (NOx) emission factors of the heavy duty diesel truck (HDDT), medium-duty diesel truck (MDDT), light duty diesel truck (LDDT) were 7.29, 5.29 and 5.53g/km. The particulate emission factors were 0.60, 0.30 and 0.14g/km respectively, higher than the similar reported in the previous studies. Both gaseous and particulate emission exhibit significant correlations with the change in vehicle speed, acceleration and power demand. The highest emission was generally in high VSPs and higher loads. High engine load caused by aggressive driving was the main factor of high emissions for the vehicles on real-world conditions.}

abstract = {The approach to integrate a fourth-party logistics service provider in the German Agricultural Bulk Logistics sector marks a new concept that aims at achieving sustainable development goals in transportation, i. e., by realising full truck loads. Against the background of steadily growing transport volumes, it is of paramount importance to develop sustainability concepts in order to mitigate the impacts on the environment. At present, the processes in the domain of the German Agricultural Bulk Logistics sector are characterised by bulk transports, small and medium sized actors and paper-based processes, which offers high potential for process optimizations in terms of sustainability. Therefore, the German Agricultural Bulk Logistics sector currently explores the approach of including a fourth-party logistics service provider into its transport processes in order to render these more sustainable and reduce costs. The objective of this paper is to present the general idea of implementing a fourth-party logistics service provider into a transportation (planning) process, to clarify the different functions of the participating parties and to introduce the modified transportation planning process as artefact. By means of a mixed method approach, we deliver qualitative insights based on semi-structured interviews and quantitative insights based on simulations. Effects and benefits of the approach are identified by means of a case study. Involving the fourth-party logistics service provider as well as the associated transportation planning process in the mentioned logistics area can lead to cost savings up to 38%, helps to reduce environmental pollution and mitigates social barriers in form of existential fears. The results demonstrate the applicability of the fourth-party logistics service provider approach in the sector and underline that this approach supports the achievement of sustainable development goals in transportation. Furthermore, we identify sustainable characteristics and present the mixed method approach which functions as an assessment framework for the fourth-party logistics service provider approach. Furthermore, by adopting the documented features of sustainable supply chain management in the fourth-party logistics service provider approach, an additional value is generated.}

Nowadays increasingly intelligent, individualized products encourages companies to respond innovatively to customer requirements and to handle the rising product variations quickly. An integrated engineering network, spanning across the entire value chain, is operated to intelligently connect various company divisions, and to generate a business ecosystem for products, services and communities. The conditions for the digital twin are thereby determined in which the digital world can be fed into the real, and the real world back into the digital to deal such intelligent products with rising variations. The term digital twin can be described as a digital copy of a real factory, machine, worker etc., that is created and can be independently expanded, automatically updated as well as being globally available in real time. Every real product and production site is permanently accompanied by a digital twin. First prototypes of such digital twins already exist in the ESB Logistics Learning Factory on a cloud- and app-based software that builds on a dynamic, multidimensional data and information model. A standardized language of the robot control systems via software agents and positioning systems has to be integrated. The aspect of the continuity of the real factory in the digital factory as an economical means of ensuring continuous actuality of digital models looks as the basis of changeability. For the indoor localization sensor combinations that in addition to the hardware already contain the software required for the sensor data fusion should be used. Processing systems, scenario-live-simulations and digital shop floor management results in a mandatory procedural combination. Essential to the digital twin is the ability to consistently provide all subsystems with the latest state of all required information, methods and algorithms.}

We consider two game scenarios: the logistics provider-first scenario and the supplier-first scenario. When the cold-chain service price is exogenous, we find that when the service sensitivity is sufficiently low, each player can obtain a higher profit under the logistics provider-first scenario than under the supplier-first scenario. Counter-intuitively, for the supplier, channel leadership does not guarantee it a higher profit. When the cold-chain service price is endogenous, we find that although the relative magnitude of the supplier’s and retailer’s profits is changed under the supplier-first scenario, the other main results are unchanged qualitatively.}

This systematic review evaluates the potential impact of bioenergy buffers on multiple ecosystem services (ES) provision while describing key factors along the biomass supply chain. An Impact Assessment (IA) methodology was adopted to capture the direction and the level of confidence of impact on multiple ES including regulating (climate, water and biodiversity), supporting (soil health) and provisioning services (biomass and energy yield). The IA revealed that the implementation of bioenergy buffers on previous croplands rather than on grasslands sustains long-term provision of multiple ES such as climate, water quality and biodiversity regulation and soil health. Herbaceous buffers were found to be more effective than woody buffers in the provision of multiple ES. Knowledge gaps relative to climate and water quality regulation services were identified for the establishment phase of bioenergy buffers (0-3y). Regarding biomass logistics, the limited operating space for farm machinery was the main shortcoming when comparing bioenergy buffers to large-scale bioenergy plantations. The intra- and inter-farm spatial fragmentation of biomass supply areas may increase environmental costs related to biomass collection and transport operations, but this has not yet been fully tested. Establishing a network of bioenergy buffers increases landscape connectivity and the overall area of ES provision in the agricultural landscape. Payments for ES obtained from bioenergy buffers can ultimately improve the economics of sustainable bioenergy and help achieving environmental goals of EU policies on water, soil and biodiversity protection.}

We present a mixed-integer program that allows defining the optimal number of logistics assistants, given predefined task requirements. We combine flexible shift scheduling with a task scheduling problem. We incorporate flexibility both in terms of shift scheduling as well as task scheduling in order to define the minimum number of workers. We present a column generation based solution approach that finds optimal solutions, and compare decomposition approaches with one and two subproblems. Neither the general model nor the solution approach are limited to logistics assistants but can also be applied to other problem settings in the healthcare industry and beyond. The approach is tested with 48 problem instances in total and compared to benchmarks. As part of our solution approach, we present a lower bound for staff minimization problems with an unknown number of available workers. We show that flexibility in shift scheduling and task scheduling leads to a decrease of 40–49% of the required workforce, compared to the non-flexible case.}

abstract = {Congress established the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) as a separate administration within the U.S. Department of Transportation in the Motor Carrier Safety Improvement Act of 1999 (Public Law 106-159) and established its primary mission “to reduce crashes, injuries, and fatalities involving large trucks and buses.” This paper is designed to provide a context for assessing the progress that has been made by the FMCSA in achieving the goal of reducing truck crashes, injuries, and fatalities. The paper concludes that brokers/third party logistics providers and shippers do, indeed, share in the responsibility to select competent and safe motor carriers. Their selection and use decisions are enhanced by the FMCSA safety performance measurement system (SMS). The SMS measures carrier performance in a wide range of categories and disseminates this information on a monthly basis through its publically available website. There have been recent efforts to restrict some of these data from the public website. The paper concludes with the argument that the FMCSA’s SMS data are a vital component of the carrier selection and use process and any efforts to restrict the information from the public websites should be vigorously opposed. The overall effort to reduce truck crash rates is linked to having brokers/third party logistics providers and shippers make informed selection and use decisions by relying on individual carrier safety performance data from the FMCSA.}

In Indiana, attention is turning to biojet fuels and renewable diesel as forming the demand for these crops. This paper seeks to determine the optimal manufacturing site locations and supply chain logistics for the conversion of biomass sources to jet fuel and renewable diesel within Indiana. A sequential start-up model is developed for this application, using a mixed integer non-linear (quadratic) program, in which firms sequentially optimize unit costs by choosing the conversion site location, scale, and feedstocks. The results indicate that firms wish to locate conversion sites near biomass sources as opposed to fuel destinations, and that early entrants to the industry gravitate towards counties rich in corn stover, a less expensive residue. However, even with existing subsidies firms would barely break even. Finally, the benefits of the sequential model are elucidated in contrast to a social planner's model, with the key benefit being that the sequential model can generate supply curves independent of demand levels.}

Cross-border e-commerce has been very successful in the last decade. Merchants and consumers have been encouraged to participate in e-commerce, including B2C or B2B. B2C is not limited to a domestic market anymore. Consumers across countries are interested in overseas direct purchases. They are willing to purchase products from major online shopping sites such as Amazon and eBay. We aim at gaining a better understanding of overseas direct purchases. Determinants of overseas direct purchases based on cross-national data are identified. Accordingly, we investigate logistics and regulatory determinants. Furthermore, external environments such as regulatory institutions and globalization are discussed in terms of overseas direct purchases. This study incorporates theoretical foundations into empirical findings. Specifically, the institutional theory and the resource-based view are applied to explain the internal and external determinants to increase overseas direct purchases. We conduct an empirical test using panel data for each country to identify the various determinants associated with overseas direct purchases.}

This study conducted a case study of logistics cost analysis for rice straw pellets by considering all stages in the supply chain to define the main factors affecting the selling price of rice straw pellets: collection (job-commission or employment of part-time workers), transportation, storage (vinyl greenhouses or storage buildings with larger capacity), pelletizing, and delivery to users with biomass boilers. The selling price was found to be strongly dependent on the production capacity because the investment cost for the pellet production facility had a significant effect of economies of scale. A production capacity of larger than 1500 t y−1 is required for rice straw pellets to compete with wood pellets and fossil fuels in the studied Japanese context if the subsidy rate for the investment is 50%, part-time workers conduct the collection, and rice straw is stored in the storage buildings. Our sensitivity analysis also showed an economically feasible spatial scale: for example, rice straw should be collected within a 20 km radius and the users should be within a 38 km radius when the production capacity is 1500 t y−1. In addition, other critical factors related to the collection of rice straw from the paddy fields and transportation of rice straw rolls to storage were identified as planning factors to further reduce the total logistics cost of rice straw pellets.}

A logistic company's performance measurement is of great importance, since after performance measurement companies can observe what they have achieved and can consider what they have not. Thereby firms obtain an opportunity to learn and correct their failures. Measuring the effectiveness of the activity performed has become a topic of interest to managers in recent years. In this context, it was necessary to decide on how to measure performance. It is observed that various measures and systems are used in performance measurement. In this study, the logistic performances and marketing performances of 153 logistics companies operating in Germany and Turkey were measured and compared. As a result of the analyses performed, significant differences were found between the logistic performances and marketing performances of logistics companies in Germany and Turkey.}

Such dynamic interdependency effects between orders in close temporal and spatial neighbourhoods can have an impact on logistics performance. In this research, we introduce an index measure that quantifies the spatial and temporal relation of production orders and investigate dynamic effects of production order interdependencies using real production feedback data and derive first results for the improvement of the prediction of logistics performance in an early production planning stage as well as for the configuration of production planning and control.}

To limit the associated cost and the operational time of the corresponding surface facility, an optimization should be applied to the aforementioned problem, since its solution cannot be found analytically. To that end, the National Cooperative for the Disposal of Radioactive Waste (Nagra) developed the logistics optimization code “SIMAN”, using the so called Simulated Annealing (SA) method. The objective is to find the best possible loading configuration to minimize the total number of canisters needed. The aims of this study were to finish and analyze the performance of the previous code system and to provide features for extended analysis on the resulting canister loading configurations. Two code revisions were used to simulate different boundary conditions regarding the disposal procedure. Realistic boundary conditions confirmed to add a 10% increase (conservatively) to the total number of disposal canisters needed, compared to the solution for the simplified boundary conditions. In addition, the various reasons and their relative contributions to this increase have been determined and quantified. Finally, an extension to the reference disposal concept has been investigated (so-called “mixed canister”) indicating significant potentials for further decrease of the total number of canisters.}

The population is the Korean shipping and logistics firms in the Republic of Korea and a survey was carried out by members of liners and international freight forwarders. The questionnaires responded by members of the sample firms were used as data for the analysis of this research. The reliability and validity of the data were tested by a factor analysis and the Cronbach's alpha coefficient. In addition, the hypotheses of this research have been verified using a multiple regression analysis. The results are as follows. LIS is confirmed as a factor in enhancing the relationship between IOC and performance. The firms perform IOC by LIS in supply chains and as a result, they can achieve high performance. This is explained by fit as moderation by Venkatraman (1989). In addition, the relationship between IOC and performance is explained by a resource-based view as is and the relationship between LIS and performance is also explained by a resource-based view. Managers grasp customer needs and disseminate the needs to organizations using superior LIS, followed by high performance. Managers structure efficient supply chain processes through IOC between organizations and improve performance in the whole process through collaboration with the partners as well as departments. If managers want to achieve high performance through IOC, they should grasp their current level of LIS. This provides information; such, what strategic decision making could improve their performance? The results of this research prove the moderating effect of LIS on IOC and performance and if managers focus on the moderating effect, they can improve performance.}

In this environment, city logistics service providers (CLSP) have to fulfill deliveries cost-efficiently and reliably. To ensure cost-efficient routing while satisfying promised delivery dates, information on expected travel times between customers needs to be exploited. If a sufficient amount of data is not available or expensive to acquire, deriving this information presents a major challenge for CLSP. Therefore, we propose the usage of interval travel times (ITT) to enable cost-efficient and reliable routing in urban areas. ITT define an expected range of travel times, which can be derived with relatively low effort by CLSP. We modify an existing approach from the domain of robust planning to the requirements of routing in urban areas. Further, we present and discuss the process of deriving ITT. An exemplary city logistics setting is developed and different routing solutions are examined. Computational experiments show that, in contrast to well-known deterministic approaches, routing considering ITT allows both cost-efficient and reliable routing.}

The roles of freight forwarders as intermediaries continue to expand and become significant in international logistics. Purchasing negotiation is considered an important business process for freight forwarders and achieving a successful negotiation outcome should help forwarders to manage their business more effectively. This study used the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) approach to identify the critical factors for successful purchasing negotiation for freight forwarders in Korea. A three-level AHP structure was constructed to examine the successful purchasing negotiation. The findings indicate that information (specifically quality of information) is the most critical factor for a successful negotiation outcome for freight forwarders. This result turned out to be the same as the result found from the literature review. Literature review also indicated information as the most important factor.}

In the first tier, goods are transported in city buses from a consolidation and distribution center to a set of bus stops. The main idea is to use the buses spare capacity to drive the goods to the city core. In the second tier, final customers are distributed by a fleet of near-zero emissions city freighters. This system requires transferring the goods from buses to city freighters at the bus stops. We model the corresponding optimization problem as a variant of the pickup and delivery problem with transfers and solve it with an adaptive large neighborhood search. To evaluate its results, lower bounds are calculated with a column generation approach. The algorithm is assessed on data sets derived from a field study in the medium-sized city of La Rochelle in France.}

Therefore, such systems are usually evaluated in the planning phase using production logistics and cost-related criteria. However, some published papers illustrate that these advantages may face ergonomic drawbacks. For decision making, the evaluation must be expanded in order to consider these systems from both perspectives. In this way, unfavorable forms of work organization in U-shaped assembly systems can be detected already during the planning phase. In addition, the static methods such as spreadsheet calculations generally used for planning prove to be poorly applicable due to the overly optimistic results they generate, especially in case of model-mix systems. These aspects are especially addressed here and the difference between static and dynamic approaches are illustrated. Consequently, planning solutions must be validated dynamically by means of simulation. Only then can be judged whether the planned production logistics criteria are achievable at all. In addition, the simulation allows for more realistic statements also concerning ergonomic criteria. This approach will be demonstrated here by a near-to-reality planning case. For a comprehensive multi-criteria decision making in the face of production logistics and ergonomics the use of lexicographic ordering is shown.}

We demonstrate the competitiveness of the algorithm on existing benchmark sets for the single-resource LRP with intra-route facilities.

In addition, driver location and speed were modeled using fuzzy numbers to account for the uncertainty of their locations. Subsequently, fuzzy cross-referencing was used so that loading/unloading space information can be referenced from more than one location. The proposed methodology was applied to a small region in Seatwen District, Taichung City, Taiwan.

abstract = {Harvested hay or biomass are traditionally baled for better handling and they are transported to the outlet for final utilization. For better management of bale logistics, producers often aggregate bales into stacks so that bale-hauling equipment can haul multiple bales for improved efficiency. Objectives of this research include simulation of bale collection logistics after forming subfield stacks, evaluation of location effects of bale stack and field outlet, the number of stacks, transported bales/trip, and other field parameters on logistics distances (aggregation, transportation, and total). The software ‘R’ performed the simulation, statistical analysis, and data visualization. Formation of bale stacks decoupled aggregation and transportation components. Stacks formation thus allows for aggregation and transportation to be performed at different times. Increasing the number of subfield stacks and the number of transported bales/trip significantly reduced the total logistics distances. The order for the best bale stack and outlet locations was: middle, near middle, mid-edge along the length, mid-edge along the width, and finally, corners. Except for swath and windrow variation, the studied field variables had a highly significant influence on the logistics distances. Increased bales/trip (≥6) reduced the variations of outlet locations. Locating the field outlet at or near the center of the field along with an appropriate number of square subfields with stacks at the middle, and increased bales/trip will be the most efficient infield logistics strategy.}

abstract = {The success and sustainable operation of a commercial cellulosic biorefinery are highly dependent on price, quality, and availability of feedstocks. Currently, corn stover is a primary feedstock choice for cellulosic ethanol production and the same feedstock can be used for butanol production, which is a potential alternative biofuel. However, butanol production requires different levels of feedstock and logistical resources when compared to ethanol due to about 20% lower theoretical yield. A thorough analysis of cost, life-cycle energy use and life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions associated with a feedstock supply logistics system for butanol production is yet to be done. Additionally, quality standards for corn stover feedstock are yet to be determined, which could determine cost of the feedstock for commercial applications. Thus, this study aimed to fulfill these research gaps using techno-economic analysis and life-cycle assessment methodologies. Variability in logistical resources and other input parameters gathered from recent literature were used for analyses in this study. Average corn stover supply logistics cost ($/metric ton(t), dry), life-cycle energy use (MJ/t, dry) and life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions (kg CO2e/t, dry) were 86.9, 1073.7 and 83.8, which could increase at 95% certainty to 159–504, 1672–3817 and 138–271, respectively, depending on the types of probability distributions of the input parameters. However, the mode value of logistics cost ($/t, dry), life-cycle energy use (MJ/t, dry) and life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions (kg CO2e/t, dry) of 80–120, 913–1231 and 79–120, respectively, closely represents the results of the static model. The average estimated feedstock cost for butanol production was about 1.3 times and the minimum 95% certainty value is about 2 times more than the targeted feedstock cost ($/metric ton, dry) of 66.4, excluding preprocessing. Overall, the location of the biorefinery, quality of corn stover, sustainable agricultural practices, and optimum utilization of transportation resources were key factors that enable a sustainable feedstock supply logistics system.}

The qualitative outcomes of consequences have three discrete states concerning injuries and/or fatalities: without consequences, with injuries (with at least one injury but without fatalities), and with fatalities (at least one fatality regardless of the number of injuries). The distribution of accidents within the logistical system is based on the elementary structure of logistics subsystems and has five discrete states: production, storage, reloading, transport, and use. For the calculation of referent risk within logistical subsystems, accident with fatalities has been adopted. The results obtained point to the significant influence of logistical subsystems on the distribution of the risk of accidents with fatalities for different dangerous goods.}

abstract = {The duration of logistics operations, as well as the environmental conditions during these operations, significantly impact the performance of a logistics network for fresh agricultural products. When durations or temperatures increase, product quality decreases and more effort is required to deliver products in time and with the right quality. Different network designs lead to different durations and conditions of transport, storage, processing, etc. Therefore, when making network design decisions, consequences for lead time and product quality should be taken into account. As decay of perishable products, for instance food, is often not uniform, heterogeneity in product quality decay also has to be considered. The aim of this paper is to show how product quality decay as well as its heterogeneity can be integrated in a network design model. A new mixed integer linear programming formulation is presented, which positions stocks and allocates processes to maximise profit under quality constraints. It is applied to several test instances from the horticultural sector. Results show that different levels of decay lead to different network structures. Changing decay rates due to processing particularly affect the level of postponement. Heterogeneity in product quality causes a split in product flows with high and low product quality. All in all, it is shown that heterogeneous product quality decay should be taken into account in network design as it significantly influences network designs and their profitability, especially when the supply chain includes processes that change the level of decay, and product quality differences can be exploited in serving different markets.}

Due to the growing operational complexities, the planning system is not only required to focus on ensuring the feasibility of daily plan, but also be capable of manipulating conflict of interest (COI) by exploiting efficient negotiation. This paper addresses a challenge of hinterland transport planning caused by limited information sharing, lack of collaboration and COI. We design collaboration and decision-making mechanisms for the implementation of autonomous control by means of multi agent technology and hybrid heuristics. It aims at providing quality plan to achieve high level of performance and robustness in hinterland logistics. From a system point of view, a service oriented architecture is proposed to integrate agent paradigm with a web-based planning system. From an operational point of view, special attentions are paid on establishing multi-dimensional collaborations between different stakeholders under the support of game theoretic approach. Specifically, we define how planning activities are executed, which level of collaborations are incorporated and how benefits are achieved with a global point of view. Due to the NP-hard nature of the addressed problem, an integrated NGSA-II and simulated annealing algorithm is implemented for assisting decision making. The parameters associated with the algorithm are tuned based on the Taguchi method. Case and comparative study will be presented to validate the appropriateness and performance of the approach.}

The study focuses on how LSPs create value by taking advantage of being connected and exploring the presence of various forms of interdependence. Using a single case study and a framework addressing network externalities and the concept of value logic interaction, we identify three types of collaborative value creation; distributive, functional and systemic. Whereas the fundamental logic of the LSP is mediation in terms of performing a distributive service, it is also subject to externalities in its functional and systemic value creation initiatives. LSPs are thereby portrayed as strategic entities dealing with a set of interdependencies in order to facilitate value creation in their networks. These firms need a rather advanced understanding of different types of economies and forms of collaboration to succeed. The study also associates different types of LSPs with the identified types of collaborative value creation.}

All of these stages are interconnected by various information and transportation tasks to be performed. In every production and sales process, there are material flows from raw material sources through factories, distribution centers, wholesalers, retailers to final customers. There are also the reverse flows of information and materials from the clients to the suppliers. The logistics that we study in this chapter have a task to synchronize material flows and information flows, to meet customer expectations, and to provide on-time delivery. The main task of distribution logistics is to deliver final products to customers. Distribution of goods from warehouses to shops and supermarkets cannot be well organized without appropriate vehicle routing and scheduling. Location analysis and vehicle routing/scheduling are two important areas where logistics and transportation intersect. In this chapter, we also outline the basics of the location analysis, and vehicle routing and scheduling problems.}

abstract = {The future of logistics shipping bases will be to seek efficient flows of materials to meet the needs of business partners. Supply chain and operations managers of supply bases will need to integrate technologies that allow for greater automation, digitalization, flexibility and improved communications among stakeholders. The technologies that are likely to boost integration will consist of a plethora of Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) technologies that may include Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies and could be applied for improved monitoring of healthy and safe industrial workplaces for workers. However, little is known regarding how WSN technologies can be implemented on a larger scale and its implications when integrated on standard logistics and operations of industrial workplaces such as a shipping base. The WSN sensor units represent an integrating resource that are capable of monitoring air temperature, humidity and levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other gasses and of disseminating this information to different actors in the production system. Air quality factors play a critical role in the perceived levels of workers' comfort and in reported medical health. The low cost of wireless sensor network (WSN) technologies offer potential for continuous, autonomous and importantly networked assessment of industrial workplace air quality that may have implications for operations management and quality of production. This paper initially presents a case study that monitors air quality that is collected with WSN technologies from two workshops carried out by a large on-shore logistics base that supports offshore petroleum logistics. The case study demonstrates a monitoring and visualization approach for facilitating BD in decision making for health and safety in the shipping industry. However, with the advancement in IIoT technologies and the emergence of smart sensing and actuating devices, it is possible to form a digital closed-loop system that we argue is essential for managers to link together information about air quality with supply chain and operations management decisions. We propose that central to effective decision making is the data analytics approach and visualization of what is potentially, big data (BD) in monitoring the air quality in industrial workplaces. We discuss how WSN technologies can be integrated into the logistics management and operations of the shipping base. Through an analytical discussion of BD we explore how to extend the potential application of IIoT and Visual Analytics to facilitate a smart workplace for the Industry 4.0 era.}

To assess the extent to which SCA is applied within LSCM, we propose a maturity framework of SCA, based on four capability levels, that is, functional, process-based, collaborative, agile SCA, and sustainable SCA. We highlight the role of SCA in LSCM and denote the use of methodologies and techniques to collect, disseminate, analyze, and use big data driven information.

Such design included cooling tank location, assigning producers to the tanks and calculating system capacity. This research was aimed at identifying the most robust and cost-efficient configuration (given the design's parameters). Perturbation parameters, robustness requirements and performance features were thus qualitatively and quantitatively identified; the perturbation parameters’ impact on robustness requirements and performance features was also determined. A supply chain involves a variety of configurations, along with variations in milk supply (perturbation parameter). The most robust configuration and associated costs were thus identified through robustness-cost characterization and used for designing the dairy cooperative's logistical storage and refrigeration system. A tactical plan was also drawn up for optimizing cooling tank use. Our main theoretical conclusion regarding this matter (depending on how robustness requirements and perturbation parameters are defined and calculated) suggested that the most robust system does not necessarily represent higher costs because the most robust configurations were in fact the least costly concerning high milk supply values.}

Today, in order to be successful, it is no longer enough to manage an organization relying exclusively on local performance objectives and in a compartmentalized way. Rather, organizations have to be managed in a transversal way, considering all possible options. Hence, the term “logistics” which has mainly been used in military language to refer to the art of combining all means of transport, supplies and housing facilities so as to conveniently manage the physical and information flows throughout a chain, called a logistics chain (LC), which starts at the provider’s supplier and finishes at the client’s customer. This is translated in terms of reliability and transfer speed of physical and information flows in order to attain the aims of the organization. In other words, logistics is interested in the planning and efficient follow-up of physical and information flows in order to satisfy a need. It consists of all the activities that aim to select a set of resources at the lowest cost, for the purpose of conforming to customers’ requirements.}

To improve the intermodal transport, we must improve the performance of terminal operations, especially the harbor container terminal (HCT). In order to be efficient, the HCTs logistics sector has to reach a certain business process maturity. One strong recommendation to reduce non-compliance with the top management strategy is through auditing and assessment of processes. The organizations are required to implement appropriate governance and compliance with applicable laws and best practices. Consequently, the aim of this article is to understand the functioning and the issues related to the HCTs management. To achieve that, this article proposes a study of HCT processes. It presents a diagnostic solution of non-compliances generated by HCTs processes. Then shows an original and practical approach based on the structural analysis. This approach helps the HCT logistics organizational structure assessment. This research fits into organizational audit issues solving.

Examples of these strategies are change in delivery operations, change in delivery vehicles, new strategies etc. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach based on Gap Analysis and Importance Performance Analysis for selecting the most viable strategy for SMEs. In the first step, we identify the criteria for evaluating business strategies using literature review and discussion with logistics experts. In the second step, we conduct gap analysis to identify the gaps between the expected performance of the business operation strategies and the perceived performance. Lastly, we conduct Importance-Performance analysis to determine the areas in which business operation strategies perform best or worst and in which areas they need to improvise. A numerical application is provided.}

abstract = {Agent-based modeling is used for simulating the actions and interactions of autonomous entities aiming to assessing their effects on the system as a whole. At an abstract level, an agent-based model (ABM) is a representation of the many simple agents and interactions among them. The decision making of the agents is based on the rules given to them. In an ABM, the model output is the result of internal decision-making and may differ with alteration in the decision path. On the contrary, with the set of rules embedded in agents, their behavior is modeled to take a ‘certain action’ in a ‘certain situation’. It suggests that the internal decision making behavior of agents is truly responsible for the model output and thus it cannot be ignored while validating ABMs. This research article focuses on the validating agents’ behavior by evaluating decision-making processes of agents. For this purpose, we propose a validation framework based on a participatory simulation game. Using this framework we engage a human player (i.e. a domain stakeholder) to allow us to collect information about choices and validate the behavior of an individual agent. A proof-of-concept game is developed for a city logistics ABM to test the framework.}

However, there are always various uncertainties when making decisions related to planning and implementing post-disaster relief logistics. Considering the particular environmental conditions during post-disaster relief after a catastrophic earthquake in a mountainous area, this paper proposes a stochastic model for post-disaster relief logistics to guide the tactical design for mobilizing relief supply levels, planning initial helicopter deployments, and creating transportation plans within the disaster region, given the uncertainties in demand and transportation time. We then introduce a robust optimization approach to cope with these uncertainties and deduce the robust counterpart of the proposed stochastic model. A numerical example based on disaster logistics during the Great Sichuan Earthquake demonstrates that the model can help post-disaster managers to determine the initial deployments of emergency resources. Sensitivity analyses explore the trade-off between optimization and robustness by varying the robust optimization parameter values.}

abstract = {Background
Variability in pre-analytical procedures such as blood sampling, sample preparation and transport can substantially influence bioanalytical results and subsequently impair reliability of data gathered during clinical trials. Especially in vulnerable populations, all efforts should be made to facilitate high-quality data extraction excluding unnecessary or repeated intervention.
Methods
The EU-funded LENA project (Labeling of Enalapril from Neonates up to Adolescents) included a feasibility study in its preparatory procedures prior to first-in-child studies. Derived from a regular study visit, it encompassed all procedures, from sampling of two study-specific drugs and four sensitive humoral parameters to bioanalysis, to evaluate the quality of obtained samples and applicability of logistical and bioanalytical procedures. Drug administration to healthy adults was circumvented by pre-spiking the blood collection tubes with a drug solution. Five clinical sites were evaluated.
Results
Clinical teams' preparedness and applicability of required sampling procedures was investigated in 18 volunteers, on-site. 97% of collected pharmacokinetic (PK) samples and 93% of samples for humoral parameters were obtained eligibly. Results met expectations, though one team had to be re-trained and performed a re-run. Planned procedures for sampling, sample preparation, transport and analysis were found to be suitable for being applied within paediatric trials.
Conclusion
The concept of the presented feasibility study that simultaneously assesses PK/PD sampling, sample preparation, logistics and bioanalysis proved to be a promising tool for trial preparation. It revealed improperly installed processes and bottlenecks that required adjustments prior to start of recruitment. It facilitated high-quality conduct from the first moment of paediatric pivotal studies.}

Herein, we describe how MCSs developed into central hubs of lipid logistics during the evolution of eukaryotic cells. We then focus on how modern eukaryotes exploit MCSs to help solve a major logistical problem, namely to preserve the unique lipid mixtures of their early and late secretory organelles in the face of extensive vesicular trafficking.

Such smart factories will offer a variety of production technologies as services that can be combined ad hoc to produce a large number of different product types and variants cost-effectively even in small lot sizes. This is enabled by cyber-physical systems that feature flexible automated planning methods for production scheduling, execution control, and in-factory logistics. During development, testbeds are required to determine the applicability of integrated systems in such scenarios. Furthermore, benchmarks are needed to quantify and compare system performance in these industry-inspired scenarios at a comprehensible and manageable size which is, at the same time, complex enough to yield meaningful results. In this chapter, based on our experience in the RoboCup Logistics League (RCLL) as a specific example, we derive a generic blueprint for how a holistic benchmark can be developed, which combines a specific scenario with a set of key performance indicators as metrics to evaluate the overall integrated system and its components.}

However, existing compartmental models do not explicitly consider the spatial spread of an epidemic and logistics issues simultaneously. In this study, we address this limitation by introducing a new epidemics–logistics mixed-integer programming (MIP) model that determines the optimal amount, timing and location of resources that are allocated for controlling an infectious disease outbreak while accounting for its spatial spread dynamics. The objective of this proposed model is to minimize the total number of infections and fatalities under a limited budget over a multi-period planning horizon. The present study is the first spatially explicit optimization approach that considers geographically varying rates for disease transmission, migration of infected individuals over different regions, and varying treatment rates due to the limited capacity of treatment centers. We illustrate the performance of the MIP model using the case of the 2014–2015 Ebola outbreak in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Our results provide explicit information on intervention timing and intensity for each specific region of these most affected countries. Our model predictions closely fit the real outbreak data and suggest that large upfront investments in treatment and isolation result in the most efficient use of resources to minimize infections. The proposed modeling framework can be adopted to study other infectious diseases and provide tangible policy recommendations for controlling an infectious disease outbreak over large spatial and temporal scales.}

The first part of the article proposes a novel methodology for the calculation of the energy intensity associated with the transportation of liquid fuels (gasoline and diesel) via road freight transport (tankers). The computation is based on the fuel economy of the vehicles from the fleet, the distance travelled, the volumes of fuel dispatched from the terminals and the loads assigned to each type of vehicle. The assessment is derived upon data collected from the main terminals located in Quito (Beaterio) and Guayaquil (Pascuales). The second part of the article comprises an estimate of the potential savings that could be achieved through the implementation of three recommendations including: a redistribution of the loads assigned to each vehicle category, a reduction in fuel economy due to eco driving initiatives and the introduction of a new terminal. This paper aims to provide a better understanding of the logistics behind the transportation of liquid fuels in Ecuador and also to predict the energy savings that could be accomplished through optimization approaches.}

Utilizing a centralized grinding supply chain with modified dump trucks to pre-haul loose slash and a decoupled chip truck transportation system has been found to maximize the utilization rate of machines and productivity of forest residue recovery operations in northern California. This study used a spatial analysis approach to identify the optimal locations for centralized grinding and trailer landings based on the spatial distribution of biomass, existing road networks, and terrain characteristics. The network analyst in ArcGIS was used to model the supply chain logistics from the harvest unit to the energy facility. The resulting models provide explicit details on developing an operational work plan that can be used to cost-effectively implement large-scale centralized biomass recovery operations on industrial timberlands. Optimization of system logistics resulted in low costs of collection and transportation as well as improved access to recoverable forest residues. This was done by identifying the locations of landings, amount and distribution of recoverable forest residues, and modeling an efficient forest residue freight supply chain. Through the use of spatial and network analysis, operational mangers will now be able to develop a comprehensive work plan that provides a framework for centralized biomass recovery operations.}

Numerous studies have investigated ordinary portland cement (OPC) alternatives with the goal of reducing GHG emissions. This life cycle assessment (LCA) adds transportation as a focus of the assessment, in addition to the process steps from cradle to the gate of finished cementitious product. GHG emissions and cost are assessed for five cement types with comparable performance (1) OPC; (2) blended OPC with slag (SC); (3) blended OPC with fly ash (FAC); (4) metakaolin-based geopolymer (MKG); and (5) high volume limestone alkali-activated slag cements (HLAASCs). Transportation logistics are known to be critical for the cement industry, and this holds true for alternative cements. The influence of feedstock source location and transport mode within the supply chain significantly affect both environmental impacts (up to 80% of GHG emissions) and production cost (up to 65%), and should thus be a major consideration. All OPC alternatives reduce GHG emissions, even at the least beneficial points of their ranges. HLAASC reduces GHG emissions and energy consumption in all cases studied, by up to 95% and 83%. SC and FAC have comparable reductions in GHG emissions and energy, and their ranges overlap. MKG reduces GHG emissions but not energy input for the cases studied, however the energy demand may be closer to the other binders studied where the mineral is available and from low grade sources.}

The supplier supplies raw materials (jobs) to the manufacturer, which processes them into finished products (processed jobs) and transports them to the customer. We analyze the problem using a batching and scheduling model involving both batch supply and batch delivery. The objective is to minimize the sum of the total weighted inventory cost and transport cost. The inventory cost is related to the job flow time, which is the time between the arrival of a job to the manufacturer and the time it is finished processing and leaves the manufacturer. The transport cost is related to the number of batches created. Four cases associated with batch supply and batch delivery, depending on the relative strengths of the arrival cost, inventory cost, and delivery cost are discussed in this paper. We show that all the cases are NP-hard when the number of batches has a constant upper bound, and give a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme for each case.}

This contribution proposes a new way to develop a more action-driven form of these partnerships that follows from a solution approach, which has proved successful worldwide in fostering innovation deployment, but has not yet been applied explicitly in the domain of City Logistics: Living Labs. The living lab approach ensures that the stakeholders are involved much earlier in the in planning and implementation processes, and that the proposed city logistics implementation is revised and continuously improved to meet stakeholder needs and obtain maximum impact for a long time. This contribution summarizes the steps that have to be taken to set-up and work in a city logistics living lab (CLLL). A CLLL can be defined as a dynamic test environment where complex city logistics innovations can be implemented, following a cyclical approach, where several solutions can be experimented and re-adjusted or improved to fit the real-life city challenges. In the Horizon 2020 project CITYLAB, we developed practical guidelines for establishing and running a city logistics living lab based on several living lab- and field test methodologies that enables stakeholders to set-up and run a CLLL. This contribution discusses the most important CLLL phases, roles, and characteristics, as well as the tools that are available. Next, this contribution shows the first results of cities in which CLLLs are actually set up, or already running.}

We consider a green supply chain design that considers CO2 transport emissions under different postponement strategy scenarios using a simulation tool. The paper focuses on a relevant extension of postponement theory by including green considerations into the evaluation of postponement strategies in green supply chain design. Moreover, it provides some insight on how to measure and evaluate the impact of postponement regarding supply chain transport performance, considering different transport mode (container ocean ship and truck) using the European Platform on Life-Cycle Assessment (EPLCA) of ELCD – European Life-Cycle Database. The study has demonstrated that logistics and packing postponement strategies can improve the performance of logistics (total inventory and order lead-time) and, at the same time contribute to reducing the environmental impact of CO2 emissions from transportation process.}

Therefore, this study addresses the process of collecting WEEE products from service points, transporting them to recycling facilities, and recovery of the waste materials. Our framework considers triple-bottom-line approach and employs goal programming to reach economic, social and environmental targets. A multi-facility, multi-product and multi-period mathematical model is proposed, considering the real conditions, for the first time in the literature. In addition, this goal programming approach is illustrated on a WEEE reverse supply chain of the household appliances.}

Procurement and transportation is one of the supply chain business operations where carbon emissions are huge. This paper proposes an environmentally sustainable procurement and logistics model for a supply chain. The proposed models are of MINLP (Mixed Integer Non Linear Program) and MILP (Mixed Integer Linear Program) form requiring a variety of the real time parameters from buyer and supplier side such as costs, capacities, lead-times and emissions. Based on real time data, the models provide an optimal sustainable procurement and transportation decision. It is also shown that large sized problems possessing essential 3V's of big data, i.e., volume, variety and velocity consume non-polynomial time and cannot be solved optimally. Therefore, a heuristic (H-1) is also proposed to solve the large sized problems involving big data. T-test significance is also conducted between optimal and heuristic solutions obtained using 42 randomly generated data instances possessing essential characteristics of big data. Encouraging results in terms of solution quality and computational time are obtained.}

We design a toolkit to support modeling of warehouse logistics. Using this toolkit, we develop a parameter sweep application and solve three optimization tasks for adjusting parameters of a warehouse management system. The practical experiments are focused on the refrigerated warehouse. The developed applications demonstrate high efficiency and scalability capabilities to optimize nine criteria to cope with different production demands.}

The main reverse channels are reuse, remanufacturing, and recycling parts and materials. The motivation of the study is to find which processes in the process industry offer better opportunities to recover value, which would justify further research. The hypotheses are that supply, manufacturing, maintenance, distribution, and post-consumption processes offer opportunities to reuse, remanufacturing, and recycling used materials and parts. The research method is the multiple case studies in three companies in the process industry: beverages, packaging, and construction chemicals. The main research techniques were document analysis, meeting with experts and guided visits, and non-participant observation. The study concluded that the combination of channels and processes with higher potential for value recovery are reuse in manufacture and distribution, remanufacturing in maintenance, and recycling in postconsumption. The supply process has little potential for value recovery in the studied cases. Another finding is the relevance of the role played by cooperatives and municipalities in the recycling channel.}

The authors pursue the goal of shedding light on the young and mostly undiscovered topic of Industry 4.0 in the context of logistics management, thus following a conceptual research approach. At first, a logistics-oriented Industry 4.0 application model as well as the core components of Industry 4.0 are presented. Different logistics scenarios illustrate potential implications in a practice-oriented manner and are discussed with industrial experts. The studies reveal opportunities in terms of decentralisation, self-regulation and efficiency. Moreover, it becomes apparent that the concept of Industry 4.0 still lacks a clear understanding and is not fully established in practice yet. The investigations demonstrate potential Industry 4.0 implications in the context of Just-in-Time/Just-in-Sequence and cross-company Kanban systems in a precise manner. Practitioners could use the described scenarios as a reference to foster their own Industry 4.0 initiatives, with respect to logistics management.}

The business experience platform provides software solutions for every organization in the company respectively in the factory. An interface with dashboards, project management apps, 3D - design and construction apps with high end visualization, manufacturing and simulation apps as well as intelligence and social network apps in a collaborative interactive environment help the user to learn the creation of a value end to end process for a personalized virtual and later real produced product. Instead of traditional ways of working and a conventional operating factory real workers and robots work semi-intuitive together. Centerpiece in the self-planned interim factory is the smart personalized product, uniquely identifiable and locatable at all times during the production process – a scooter with an individual colored mobile phone – holder for any smart phone produced with a 3D printer in lot size one. Smart products have in the future solutions incorporated internet based services – designed and manufactured - at the costs of mass products. Additionally the scooter is equipped with a retrievable declarative product memory. Monitoring and control is handled by sensor tags and a raspberry positioned on the product. The engineering design and implementation of a changeable production system is guided by a self-execution system that independently find amongst others esplanade workplaces. The imparted competences to students and professionals are project management method SCRUM, customization of workflows by Industrie4.0 principles, the enhancements of products with new personalized intelligent parts, electrical and electronic self-programmed components and the control of access of the product memory information, to plan in a digital engineering environment and set up of the physical factory to produce customer orders.

The decision-making is performed in the cloud by temporary virtual machines (VMs) associated with every shipment or series of shipments. The VMs make operational decisions based on evaluating actual transportation conditions and location of shipped products against requirements and initial route and terminal market geographical location. The physical part of the logistics cyber-physical monitoring and control system is represented by integrated RFID-WSN sensor devices traveling with the product and reader checkpoints distributed along the transportation routes. Two types of decisions are considered in the proposed models: stopping transportation and/or rerouting the shipments to a closer location. The implementation of the optimization models for an actual case study, which considers shipments of fresh produce across the continental United States, shows significant savings that could be obtained if producers or third party logistics companies adopt the methodology.}

Often these data are subject to recording errors and omissions. Matches must then be inferred from the time stamps alone because identifying keys are unavailable, suppressed to preserve confidentiality, or ambiguous because of missing observations. We present an integer programming (IP) model developed for matching successive events in such situations and illustrate its application in three problem settings involving (a) airline operations at an airport, (b) taxi service between an airport and a train station, and (c) taxi services from an airport. With data from the third setting (where a matching key was available), we illustrate the robustness of estimates for median and mean times between events under different random rates for “failure to record”, different screening criteria for outliers, and different target times used in the IP objective. The IP model proves to be a tractable and informative tool for data matching and data cleaning, with a wide range of potential applications.}

abstract = {Current scientific studies prove the dependency of the running characteristics of permanent magnet synchronous motors on variations of the physical properties of permanent magnets and manufacturing errors. Currently, this fact is not considered in most process chains for magnet and rotor assembly. Thus, insufficient rotor quality can only be detected during the end-of-line test, causing rejects of whole motors. As a solution for these drawbacks, a computerized magnet intra-logistics storage and assembly concept is presented, using sophisticated magnet measurement technologies. This concept allows for the traceability of single magnets and enables to compensate variations of the magnetic properties by selective magnet assembly.}

The fast growth rate of AM among researchers and industrialists who are active in different fields, is a proof that it has the potentials to be an effective methodology for manufacturing components and final products. This underscores the need to look into its features more closely, and provide the capacity for further improvement and implementation. This paper presents a systematic analysis of the existing literature to illustrate how AM’s industrial applications could create distinctions from those of conventional/traditional technologies, and then based on the analysis, demonstrate the need to make reconfigurations within production, distribution, and logistics processes. Although the common strategy for including a new technological system is usually to implement it through slow integration within existing technologies, the main effort in this study has been dedicated to analyse the AM system in isolation, so that the activities which are already present and active within companies’ manufacturing processes can be spotted for optimization and improvements. At the end, a set of proposals are recommended in order to reconfigure the production system as well as the supply chain to enable AM as a reliable and functional system.}

abstract = {Urban Freight Transport (UFT) is a fundamental component of city life. It involves a vast range of activities resulting from relationships among different actors with conflicting needs and goals. Manufacturers are interested in fast and on-time deliveries, retailers require complete assortment and frequent deliveries, citizens wish to have easy access to goods while not losing their quality of life and City Authorities have to face negative externalities related to UFT (i.e. congestion, air and noise pollution, and safety). Concretely, few cities have a well-developed and comprehensive city logistics strategy because authorities generally focus their attention on passenger transport. When city logistics measures have been conceived and implemented, frequently private requirements have not been considered sufficiently. The European Commission includes the lack of data and understanding of freight flows among the main obstacles to the improvement of operational efficiency and planning process for a sustainable UFT in economic, social and environmental terms. Also, the research community raises the issue of the unavailability or the low quality of data on urban freight and the need to identify effective data collection methods in order to understand processes and actors’ behavior and then define appropriate city logistics solutions. The NOVELOG EU project is providing city authorities and practitioners with a new framework aimed at systematizing all data to be collected, directly or indirectly, and to be elaborated in order to understand and represent the different aspects of the UFT sector. In order to achieve a complete knowledge, the framework approaches this sector according to four main thematic pillars: 1) profile of major supply chains served in the urban area under study; 2) mapping of urban freight and service trips activity; 3) organizational and legal framework; 4) procedural and technological methods and innovations. The present paper introduces the framework and the guidance it provides to its target audiences.}

abstract = {Economic development is a process in which an economy converts itself from one where the community saves and invests at low levels to another where these variables are turned into higher values. Putting it in other words, more than this rather rudimentary approach, economic development can be described as a process of structural change of the economy. We can describe it as a process in which sectoral composition of the economy as well as relative sizes of the sectors undergo a serious transformation. Therefore, there appears a change in the structure of sectoral balance in the economy as some sectors resume a leading role while some new sectors may appear perhaps in parallel with the new external dynamics. In this sense economic development is an uneven process. If we dwell on this structuralist paradigm a development policy should aim at creating strategic imbalances. In this paradigm of development / growth some sectors appear to be critically strategic. The selection process of these sectors and the data required to analyse them the methodology we intend to refer is based on inter-industrial analysis. The key sectors are transport and logistics and those among the commodity-producing sectors with high linkage factors to these two strategic sectors. One of the best methods of analysing the interaction between the sectors concerned might be to analyse the spillover effects of the selected sector on others which we have tried earlier. However due mainly to methodological reasons and the lack of affiliated data we have failed to employ our model. Learning our lesson by this experience we aim to (1) sketch the domain of the sectors concerned and (2) specify the data required to carry out the analysis of the model.}

abstract = {In the last decades, natural disasters have been affecting the human life of millions of people. The impressive scale of these disasters has pointed out the need for an effective management of the relief supply operations. One of the crucial issues in this context is the routing of vehicles carrying critical supplies and help to disaster victims. This problem poses unique logistics challenges, including damaged transportation infrastructure and limited knowledge on the road travel times. In such circumstances, selecting more reliable paths could help the rescue team to provide fast services to those in needs. The classic cost-minimizing routing problems do not properly reflect the relevant issue of the arrival time, which clearly has a serious impact on the survival rate of the affected community. In this paper, we focus specifically on the arrival time objective function in a multi-vehicle routing problem where stochastic travel times are taken into account. The considered problem should be solved promptly in the aftermath of a disaster, hence we propose a fast heuristic that could be applied to solve the problem.}

abstract = {The widespread globalization of production corporations in the late 20th century, as well as the subsequent trade facilitation policies of state authorities, generates an imperative need to extend the scope of supply chain management. Apart from the evaluation and monitoring of networked operations in different parts of the world, the effectiveness of trade policy measures is also included. This paper examines the potential contributions of a logistics and transport data exchange platform in measuring the performance of supply chain stakeholders of a hub port at different stages along the chain. A case study demonstrates how the integrative characteristics of a logistics and transport data exchange platform can be exploited to measure performances of different parties along the supply chain of a firm. More importantly, the authors explain how such a platform can be transformed into a system that evaluates the integrative supply chain activities of firm, the infrastructure, and the institutional stakeholders. A series of new supply chain performance metrics, including specific monitor end-to-end processes, can be captured by the proposed system. The paper concludes that in view of the significant policy implications of a platform-based supply chain performance measurement (SCPM) system, state intervention is critical to foster a high participation rate of the logistics and transport data exchange platform and develop its SCPM functions.}

abstract = {Purpose
The paper proposes a decision support system for selecting logistics providers based on the quality function deployment (QFD) and the technique for order preference by the similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) for agricultural supply chain in France. The research provides a platform for group decision making to facilitate decision process and check the consistency of the outcomes.
Methodology
The proposed model looks at the decision problem from two points of view considering both technical and customer perspectives. The main customer criteria are confidence in a safe and durable product, emission of pollutants and hazardous materials, social responsibility, etc. The main technical factors are financial stability, quality, delivery condition, services, etc. based on the literature review. The second stage in the adopted methodology is the combination of quality function deployment and the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution to effectively analyze the decision problem. In final section we structure a group decision system called GRoUp System (GRUS) which has been developed by Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse (IRIT) in the Toulouse University.
Results
This paper designs a group decision making system to interface decision makers and customer values in order to aid agricultural partners and investors in the selection of third party logistic providers. Moreover, we have figured out a decision support system under fuzzy linguistic variables is able to assist agricultural parties in uncertain situations. This integrated and efficient decision support system enhances quality and reliability of the decision making.
Novelty/Originality
The novelty of this paper is reflected by several items. The integration of group multi-criteria decision tools enables decision makers to obtain a comprehensive understanding of customer needs and technical requirements of the logistic process. In addition, this investigation is carried out under a European commission project called Risk and Uncertain Conditions for Agriculture Production Systems (RUC-APS) which models risk reduction and elimination from the agricultural supply chain. Ultimately, we have implemented the decision support tool to select the best logistic provider among France logistics and transportation companies.}

This study investigates the problem of collaboration planning in logistics and proposes an agent-based approach for better management of collaborative logistics. Based on the approach, a decision support system is designed that utilizes RFID technology for ensuring inventory accuracy. The proposed approach involves three steps. In the first step, a conceptual agent based model is designed. In the second step, the game theory method is utilized to intensively study and analyze suppliers’ collaboration and carriers’ collaboration that represent major objectives proposed in the preceding model. Finally, correctness of the games is verified by formulating them mathematically. Developed optimization equations are fundamental to the operation research field. They employ the simplex and goal algorithms of linear programming.}

abstract = {Today, Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) still have a low market share in logistics, compared to manual forklifts. We identified one of the main bottlenecks in the rather long deployment time which involves precise 2D mapping of the plant, 3D geo-referencing of pick-up/ drop positions and the manual design of the roadmap. The long deployment time has various reasons: in state-of-the-art plant installations, designated infrastructure is still necessary for the localization; the mapping process requires highly skilled personnel; in many cases unavailable or inappropriate position information of drop points for goods must be corrected on site. Finally, the design of the roadmap, performed by expert technicians is manually optimised in a tedious process to achieve maximum flow of goods for the plant operator. In total the setup of a plant to be ready for AGV operation is taking several months, binding highly skilled technicians and involves very time-consuming and costly on-site procedures. Therefore, we present an approach to AGV deployment which aims to drastically reduce the time, cost and involved personnel. First, we propose the employment of a novel, industrial-ready SICK 3D laser scanning technology in order to build an accurate and consistent virtual representation of the whole warehouse environment. By utilizing suitable segmentation and processing a semantic map is generated that contains 3D geo-referenced positions as well as a 2D localization map eliminating the need for dedicated solution to 2D mapping. Second, the semantic map provides a free space map which is used as a basis for the automatic roadmap creation in order to achieve optimal flow. So, this paper proposes an innovative methodology for obtaining, in a semi-automated manner, the map of an industrial environment where a system of multiple AGVs will be installed with less time and cost.}
