abstract = {The rollon-rolloff vehicle routing problem (RRVRP) has drawn much attention of researchers due to the increasing concerns on waste material logistics. In literatures the RRVRP is formulated as the node routing problem with asymmetric arc cost and a maximum route length. In this paper we adopt the trip decomposition method to transfer the trip to arc demand so as to propose a vehicle flow formulation for the RRVRP. A two-stage heuristic involving the modified Clarke and Wright savings heuristic algorithm (CW) followed by a local search phase is developed to solve the formulation. The effectiveness of the proposed formulation and heuristic is demonstrated by computational experiments on randomly-generated small-scale instances and benchmark instances.}

abstract = {Due to increasing complexity of contemporary site development, more information about sites themselves and their related environmental, geographical, and surrounding infrastructure is highly desired to support informed decision-making. Fusion of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Building Information Modeling (BIM) to support decision-making in site development has gained momentum from both academia and practitioners. Nevertheless, innovative applications of GIS and BIM integration are yet to be fully explored. Using several cases in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), this article demonstrates how to integrate GIS and BIM to derive big data for decision-making in construction logistics and supply chain management (LSCM) and construction waste management in site development. In addition, this article proposes a conceptual framework of integrating BIM and GIS for better site development and urban management. The cases in this article not only shed light on big data analytics in a site development setting but also provide useful references to GIS and BIM fusion for better urban management.}

The DLR Institute of Transport Research in cooperation with IFSTTAR France conducted a detailed empirical analysis of the food retail market in France and in Germany. Based on the data collected, the differences in transport demand structures for the same product are outlined. The implications of such differences for the requirements of international freight transport modeling are discussed in conclusion.}

abstract = {Nowadays, coordination of relief items procurement in humanitarian logistics has become one of the main challenges of disaster management. In this paper, we utilize a quantity flexibility contract (QFC) to coordinate ordering activities in a three-echelon relief chain. This multi-echelon supply chain consists of a relief organization (i.e., NGO), one relief item supplier, and affected areas. In the proposed QFC, initially, the relief organization places an order before the disaster strikes and is committed to purchasing the initial quantity no less than a previously agreed amount. On the other hand, the supplier is committed to providing up to a certain amount above the initial order, if needed. Expected profit functions of relief chain members include transportation cost, inventory cost, the manufacturing cost of relief items, shortage cost, salvage value, and satisfaction level of affected areas. Our findings show that, under demand uncertainty, the proposed QFC not only prevents significant losses at relief organization but also enhances satisfaction level of the affected areas. Finally, the performance of the proposed coordination model is examined via various numerical experiments and managerial insights are extracted.}

It consists, under suitable assumptions and subject to certain operational constraints, of determining the fuel oil procurement plans of a set of petrol stations and planning the delivering routes of petrol products to the stations along a certain planning horizon. The considered problem belongs to the class of Inventory Routing Problems (IRP), of which it is a particularization. In particular, it draws its concepts from two different classes of distribution problems, the Periodic Vehicle Routing Problem (PVRP) and the Petrol Station Replenishment Problem (PSRP). We provide a mathematical formulation of the problem, and due to the large size of the real instances which in general an oil company has to deal with we heuristically solve it. We propose different heuristic strategies based on a common partitioning-then-routing paradigm, and in order to assess their performances we test them on a set of scenarios coming from Italian fuel oil distribution real cases and compare the results with those obtained by using other known heuristic approaches.}

Most of the reported work, both experimental and computational, has been in the hyper-velocity impact regime (<2000 m/s) and has focused on penetration studies, primarily into steel, to find a method to increase the performance of long rod kinetic energy penetrators. From a system’s perspective, launching a short rod and having it extend prior to impact is attractive if penetration can be increased with a lesser logistics burden. But penetration is not the only factor to consider. If the extending rod designed partitions penetrator cross-sectional area into nearly equal parts, the effective crater area at target break through will be less. This paper presents a study examining the effects extending rod penetrators may have on behind target debris at both ordnance and hyper-velocity impacts.}

Chilling injury is a common physiological hazard of cowpea in cold chain logistics which reduce the cowpea pods nutritional quality and product value. However, the molecular mechanism involved in chilling injury remains unclear in cowpea pods. RNA-Seq and sRNA-Seq technologies were employed to decipher the miRNAs and mRNAs expression profiles and their regulatory networks in cowpea pods involved in chilling stress. Differentially expressed miRNAs and mRNA profiles were obtained based on cluster analysis, miRNAs and target genes were found to show coherent relationships in the regulatory networks of chilling injury. Furthermore, we found that numerous miRNAs and nat-siRNAs' targets were predicted to be key enzymes involved in the redox reactions such as POD, CAT, AO and LOX, energy metabolism such as ATPase, FAD and NAD related enzymes and different transcription factors such as WRKY, bHLH, MYB, ERF and NAC which play important roles in chilling injury.}

This is demonstrated by exemplary studies in multiple sclerosis, and includes various histopathologic techniques and a wide range of conventional and advanced MRI sequences at various field strengths. We cover topics such as how to visualize white-matter pathology and repair with conventional and advanced MRI sequences, describe the history of visualizing pathology of the gray matter (with newly developed MRI and immunohistopathology techniques), and how advanced methods have aided research in other neurologic diseases. We conclude with several suggestions for future development, such as bridging the gap between postmortem and in vivo research and the importance of collecting non-neurological control tissue.}

By conducting a qualitative review of the extant literature, I propose that the findings from both bodies of research may be distilled to six (6) key challenges: inadequate access to institutional finance; the price of renewable energy technologies (RETs); the lack of skilled labour; underdeveloped physical infrastructure and logistics; power/dominance of incumbents; inadequate government or policy support. Through this research, I not only advance a unified conceptualisation of the challenges faced by renewable energy entrepreneurs in developing countries, but also highlight a number of the revealed opportunities for future research.}

In this paper, we are concerned about the humanitarian logistics and relief distributions during flood, keeping in mind the cost and time aspects. The first priority is to attend the most affected regions for reducing casualties. Then the humanitarian operations need to be carried out efficiently and effectively. People of some regions also might require temporary shelters. Unlike other disasters, flood related disasters also give rise to water-borne and vector-borne diseases. To combat the spread of diseases and sufferings of people, relief materials must be quickly distributed along with the reallocation operation. Here, we have tried to address the issues of evacuation of people, their reallocation to comparatively safe places and distribution of relief materials by developing a cost optimization model. We have proposed two methodologies for the problem based on mixed-integer programming technique and genetic algorithm. The solutions have been illustrated using a case study and the results of the two methods have been subsequently compared. The result shows that, performances of both the techniques are good in the situation when there is sufficient evacuation time and number of blocks and shelters also are not outsized. But, as the number of blocks and shelters increases and the evacuation time decreases, the heuristic approach achieves much better result than its counterpart.}

This study develops a method to design an economically feasible VAR treatment system, analyzing the profitability of the system as a function of logistics and uncertain market prices of the available treatment technologies' products. The design method includes an economic optimization model followed by a sensitivity analysis of the potential changes in the system’s profitability. The results show that the market price of the treatment technologies' products has a larger impact on the system’s profitability than transportation costs. Specifically, if biochar prices reach the level forecasted by experts, pyrolysis will become the dominant technology of the WTS.

However, the combination of areas to form bundles can provide economy of scale that is not seen otherwise. We highlight some issues regarding the current allocation system and we analyse the effectiveness of different bundling systems in maximizing government revenues and enhancing bidders' competitiveness. We use actual forest data to evaluate different rules and strategies for the creation and allocation of partial and full bundles. Our results suggest that the use of the option of bundling forests areas makes the auction process more beneficial to the majority of stakeholders: Government revenues are increased; the bidding companies are more likely to obtain the desired volumes and pay less for harvesting and equipment relocation; and greenhouse gas emissions are reduced.}

However, it was the implementation of newborn-screening and the early biochemical diagnosis in the 1970th that improved the cognitive outcome in CH. It took several decades to further ameliorate the details of biochemical diagnosis, screening logistics and dosing to eventually enable nowadays a normal IQ even in severely affected children. Given, that treatment starts within the first 2weeks of life, and a high dose is implemented that allows fast normalization and maintenance of a normal TSH (usually 10µg/kg up to 15µg/kg in severe cases) and a close follow up ensure a continuous treatment there is no difference between IQ of affected patients and their sibling controls. Thus, the early detection by screening and the optimal implementation of L-thyroxine substitution can prevent the disastrous former outcome of CH and represents therefore a unique success of preventive medicine.}

abstract = {While a number of studies that have examined the nature and impact of gold mining in Ghana have often identified environmental degradation as a major consequence of resource extraction, limited efforts have so far been directed at exploring the challenges and opportunities facing the implementation of environmental policies within Ghana's gold mining sector. In addition, how the views of critical stakeholders can be harnessed to ensure the effective implementation of the current environmental policies in the gold mining sector has also received limited attention. Consequently, drawing on qualitative data that are complemented with the analysis of government policy documents, this study reveals that, lack of community participation, insufficient coordination among government institutions, inadequate personnel and logistics, and lack of political will are factors contributing to the ineffective implementation of environmental policies in Ghana's gold mining sector. The paper concludes by considering the theoretical and policy implication of its findings for effective environmental policy implementation in Ghana.}

While trying to be on the top of the ranking of cities in the region, the country or the world, most cities do not always use all available resources and competitive advantages. The last few years have proved inefficiency of conventional techniques of municipal management in terms of city development. City marketing is considered by the authors as one of the modern tools for forming and strengthening a city brand worldwide (Seisdedos, 2004). The analysis of city marketing in Ukraine, on a national and local level, led to the conclusion that there is a need to form both national and local city marketing strategies. Special emphasis was put on marketing for small cities in Ukraine as the key aspect of their further development. Furthermore, the approaches to create sustainable city marketing for small cities on the example of small cities in the Kharkiv region are presented.}

abstract = {Many recent studies stress the importance of freight facility location for urban freight movement. Although, tools and reflections are still lacking to shed light on shopkeepers’ location choices. Several reasons, e.g. the implementation of long-term city logistics measures or the threat of commercial rent increasing can lead retail-store keepers to move their business from city centre to surroundings. Therefore, it becomes critical for them as for urban policy makers to have tools for simulating or assessing the effects of such a choice on the business, and on the local economy, land-use and environment. This paper assumes that the shopkeepers’ choices are mainly influenced by whether their customers accept or reject this move. It aims to forecast the choice of customers to remain or not client of a retail store after its relocation in the urban periphery, by predicting the most significant factors, which are likely to influence their decision. Starting from some surveys carried-out before the movement of an actual city centre store in Saint-Etienne, the paper suggests a conditional inference tree rather than other tree-structured models for this analysis. Over the peculiarities of the store and the city, the model estimated and tested in this paper underpins many findings available in the general literature about shopping trips. The results seem to be indicating that not only customers’ residence, but also their shopping trip behaviours and wanderings are to be taken into account in a retail-store location decision.}

Here we show that intestinal bioconversion of β-carotene can be estimated based on analysis of a single plasma sample collected 6 h after subjects ingest a test dose of stable isotope-labeled β-carotene from the ratio of retinyl esters to retinyl esters plus β-carotene. Plasma isotope ratio predictions of bioconversion ranged from 50 to– 93% (mean 76%) for 45 healthy young adults with low vitamin A stores. Results were the same as predictions made by a traditional area-under-the-curve method calculated from 0 to– 8 h or a modified area-under-the-curve method calculated from 0 to– 12 h. The modified method may provide better estimates of bioconversion between 8 and 24 h after ingestion of a carotenoid dose when stable isotopes cannot be used due to cost or logistics. Furthermore, because the plasma isotope ratio method requires only one blood sample and no isolation of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, its use will facilitate estimation of provitamin A carotenoid bioconversion in human subjects and especially children, in whom repeated blood sampling is not feasible.}

Workload forecasting is essential when it comes to truck arrivals for the avoidance of bottlenecks and the smooth integration of container terminals in the supply chain. Terminal operators, tend to make stacking decisions based on mostly on factors suc the container's weight, size and type. The suggested methodology requires the collection of aggregate data and the application of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to identify the determinants of Dwell Time (DT). The first results of the ANN showed that the most important factors affecting significantly the model's accuracy are the following: containers size and type, the day and month of the container's discharge, the vessel's port of origin and the commodities transported.}

The majority of patients with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) are cured with initial therapy. However, high-dose therapy with autologous hematopoietic cell transplant (AHCT) allows for the cure of an additional portion of patients with relapsed or primary refractory disease. Positron emission tomography–negative complete remission before AHCT is critical for long-term disease control. Several salvage options are available with comparable response rates, and the choice can be dependent of comorbidities and logistics. Radiation therapy can also improve the remission rate and is an important therapeutic option for selected patients. Brentuximab vedotin (BV) maintenance after AHCT is beneficial in patients at high risk for relapse, especially those with more than 1 risk factor, but can have the possibility of significant side effects, primarily neuropathy. Newer agents with novel mechanisms of action are under investigation to improve response rates for patients with subsequent relapse, although are not curative alone. BV and the checkpoint inhibitors nivolumab and pembrolizumab are very effective with limited side effects and can bridge patients to curative allogeneic transplants (allo-HCT). Consideration for immune-mediated toxicities, timing of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant based on response, and the potential for increased graft-versus-host disease remain important. Overall, prospective investigations continue to improve outcomes and minimize toxicity for relapsed or primary refractory HL patients.}

Many stakeholders have, however, identified permanent housing reconstruction as one of the least successful humanitarian interventions as many housing interventions fail to achieve their intended outcomes. As a result, there have been calls for evidence-based studies to provide guidance for policy-makers and practitioners towards effective management of permanent housing programmes. This paper seeks to identify the issues that influence the effective management of permanent housing interventions and the measures that could be applied to manage those issues. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with experts in post-disaster reconstruction and analyzed with the aid of NVivo 11 software. The findings served to validate and extend the issues influencing effective implementation of permanent housing interventions which had been identified in earlier research. These issues have been thematically classified into human resource issues; workmanship and quality issues; monitoring and control issues; coordination and communication issues; logistics and supplies issues; financial management issues; and health and safety issues. The study further identifies and presents the integrated measures that can be applied by policy-makers and practitioners to manage these issues and thus promote effective permanent housing reconstruction programmes.}

IoT applications range from mission-critical predicaments (e.g., Smart Grid, Intelligent Transportation Systems, video surveillance, e-health) to business-oriented applications (e.g., banking, logistics, insurance, and contract law). There is a need for comprehensive support of security in the IoT, especially for mission-critical applications, but also for the down-stream business applications. A number of security techniques and approaches have been proposed and/or utilized. Blockchain mechanisms (BCMs) play a role in securing many IoT-oriented applications by becoming part of a security mosaic, in the context of a defenses-in-depth/Castle Approach. A blockchain is a database that stores all processed transactions – or data – in chronological order, in a set of computer memories that are tamperproof to adversaries. These transactions are then shared by all participating users. Information is stored and/or published as a public ledger that is infeasible to modify; every user or node in the system retains the same ledger as all other users or nodes in the network. This paper highlights some IoT environments where BCMs play an important role, while at the same time pointing out that BCMs are only part of the IoT Security (IoTSec) solution.}

In order to show the benefits of our approach to the scalable application management in integrated cluster environments, we developed a parameter sweep application for simulation modeling of warehouse logistics and solved three optimization tasks for the real refrigerated warehouse. We compared the selected criteria of task solving processes with the hypervisor shell applying and without it by means of simulation modeling.

Therefore, wireless sensor methods are currently being researched to monitor the curing of fiber-reinforced composites online and in situ during the fabrication process. At the same time radio frequency identification (RFID) technology is being used to identify fiber-reinforced composite components in production and logistics. In this paper we present results to combine these two approaches. We monitor the cure of glass fiber-reinforced composites in situ and online using RFID technology. In experiments we have determined a relation between the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) of the RFID transponder integrated into a glass fiber-reinforced composites component and the curing of the component. As comparison method for the verification of the curing processes we used the dielectric analysis as a well-known method for the cure monitoring. The results demonstrate that the so-called curing transponder makes it possible by means of detecting the RSSI to monitor the curing process of glass fiber-reinforced composite components. The curing transponder system combine as one system the advantages of cure monitoring and the advantages of using RFID technology in the further product life. Furthermore, the curing transponder can be simply integrated into the glass fiber components, it is a low-cost transponder and can be readout wireless.}

This kind of transportation is quickly becoming an essential service for modern public mobility or logistics providers. In the DARP, a set of transportation requests has to be handled by a fleet of vehicles. Each request corresponds to a client to be transported from a pickup point to a delivery point. The routing costs have to be minimized, while respecting a set of constraints including time windows on nodes, maximum riding time per client and a maximal total duration of trips. An Evolutionary Local Search (ELS) based approach is proposed to solve this problem. A new greedy randomized heuristic to compute initial solutions is developed. A dynamic probabilities management mechanism is used in the local search to improve the convergence. The method is benchmarked on a classic set of instances from the literature and it is compared against state of the art methods. The numerical results show the effectiveness of this approach.}

Our initial findings suggest that different types of manufacturing systems display different synchronization behaviors and that periodically driven systems with deterministic arrival and service rates display higher synchronization in comparison to stochastic ones. Further, we show that intrinsic physics synchronization is correlated to capacity utilization, throughput times and WIP levels, suggesting the co-activity of operations is related to highly utilized systems, while external physics synchronization is anticorrelated to throughput times and WIP levels, suggesting that higher efficiencies emerge with workstation repetitive behavior.}

abstract = {We study a new routing problem arising in City Logistics. Given a ring connecting a set of urban distribution centers (UDCs) in the outskirts of a city, the problem consists in delivering goods from virtual gates located outside the city to the customers inside of it. Goods are transported from a gate to a UDC, then either go to another UDC before being delivered to customers or are directly shipped from the first UDC. The reverse process occurs for pick-up. Routes are performed by electric vans and may be open. The objective is to find a set of routes that visit each customer and to determine ring and gates-UDC flows so that the total transportation and routing cost is minimized. We solve this problem using a column generation-based heuristic, which is tested over a set of benchmark instances issued from a more strategic location-routing problem.}

Through a survey using stated choice scenarios discrete choice models controlling for context and experience effects are specified. The results suggest that distinct preference patterns exist for distance classes of the shipment. In the local delivery setting, senders value transparency of driver performance monitoring along with speed, while longer shipments prioritize delivery conditions and driver training and experience. The model developed in this paper provides first key insights into the factors affecting preferences for goods delivery with occasional drivers.}

This survey presents a framework to classify different types of non-emergency and emergency HCFs in terms of location management, and reviews the literature based on the framework. The papers on HCF location problems are classified in detailed tables along ten descriptive dimensions, which are consideration of uncertainty, multi-period setting, particular input/setting, objective function, decision variable, constraint, basic discrete location problem, mathematical modeling approach, solution method, and case study inclusion. For each HCF type, research gaps and possible future directions are identified.

Irregularities in the execution duration of business processes impede corporate agility and can incur severe consequences, such as project failures and financial losses. Efficient managers must constantly identify potential irregularities in process durations to anticipate and avoid process glitches. This paper proposed a k-nearest neighbor method for systematically detecting irregular process instances in a business using a comprehensive set of activity-level durations, namely execution, transmission, queue, and procrastination durations. Moreover, because agents, customers, and other variables influence the progress of processes, contextual information was presented using fuzzy values. The values and corresponding membership functions were used to adjust the durations of each activity. This proposed method was applied to the system logs of a medium-sized logistics company to identify irregularities. Experts confirmed that 81% of the identified irregular instances were abnormal.}

Preliminary findings from an ethnically diverse sample of 265 youth indicate favorable perceptions of using ACASI.

These findings have implications in designing port competitiveness strategies and economic development policies in landlocked countries.}

The issue is that the distribution of devices among the vehicles operating in the network is at times sparse and uneven. This creates the necessity to reconstruct actual traffic conditions from incomplete data. In this paper, we address the issue with suggesting the methodology capable of reconstructing traffic conditions for the whole road network from GPS tracks generated by public transportation vehicles. The method has been tested for the dataset collected for the road network of Saint Petersburg. The proposed approach allows to calculate time of a ride between two pairs of addresses located not more than 15 kilometers (in a straight line) apart with the Mean Absolute Percentage Error of just over 20 percent.}

The results highlight two critical factors that ultimately determine the economic and/or environmental fuel viability. The first factor, the logistics scheme, exhibited the disadvantage of the centralized approach, owing to prohibitively expensive transportation costs of the low energy-dense lignin. Life cycle analysis (LCA) displayed the second critical factor related to alternative energy carrier selection. Natural gas (NG) chosen over additional biomass boosts well-to-wheel greenhouse gas emissions (WTW GHG) to a level incompatible with the reduction targets set by the U.S. renewable fuel standard (RFS). Adversely, the process’ economics revealed higher profits vs. fossil energy carrier.}

The proposed algorithm is allowed to search infeasible solutions and several efficient strategies are developed to escape from local optima. The extensive computational results on several well-known benchmark data sets verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

This empirical investigation aims to ascertain the supply environment factors and information system which affect SCI and whether SCI affect operational and environmental performance. Data collected from 110 haulier companies were analysed using partial least squares, structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) methodology. Supply environment which represents transaction attributes affects SCI which in turn positively affects operational and environmental performance. Information system reduces information asymmetry between transacting organizations and by this, moderate the effect of supply environment on SCI. Results provide evidence that SCI is dependent on the context of the supply environment. Opportunistic behavior due to information asymmetry could also be curtailed by proper information system. Therefore, practitioners and stakeholders need to align SCI to the context of supply environment to reap the maximum benefit of SCI. Concurrently, opportunistic behavior needs to be curtailed in supply chain to improve operational and environmental performance.}

The costs totaled $24.7 million instead of the estimated $43 million. So, we ask, how was this possible and is there something we could learn? Based on a review of existing literature describing the history and construction of the ESB, we outline strategic, operational, and contextual explanations for what appears to be a truly successful megaproject. We illustrate how, for example, inspiration from Henry Ford’s assembly line technique, the uniqueness of the logistics during the construction period, the economic decline of the Depression, and early ideas of concurrent engineering and fast-track construction enabled the success. Our conclusion is that there are lessons to be learned in going back to basics when tackling a megaproject.}

In the past, researchers have proposed the use of static load balancing or server response times to evaluate load balancing capacity, a lack of which may cause a server to load unevenly. In this study, a dynamic annexed balance method is used to solve this problem. Cloud load balancing (CLB) takes into consideration both server processing power and computer loading, thus making it less likely that a server will be unable to handle excessive computational requirements.

However, research results show that many remanufacturing companies obtain low incomes. The remanufacturing industry is a complex industry. Remanufacturers, manufacturers, dealers, service stations, consumers, and their interactions all affect the industry. Refurbishing firms and the government are also involved in this business, with the latter playing an important role. The analysis of interaction effects indicates that the current development status is caused by multiple barriers, and these barriers can also be found in other emerging economies.

Due to the availability of new MRI hardware and software solutions, CT examinations can be omitted for prostate radiotherapy simulations. All information for treatment planning, including electron density maps and bony anatomy, can nowadays be obtained with MRI.

In addition, new types of behaviors of bifurcation and chaos are found, which are different from those of the integer-order and the previous fractional-order logistic maps.}

To evaluate current survivorship or long-term follow-up (LTFU) clinics specifically for HCT survivors and to evaluate the potential barriers in their establishment, the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (ASBMT) Practice Guidelines Committee electronically surveyed 200 HCT programs to gather quantitative and qualitative data about models of care. Among 77 programs (38.5%) that responded, 45% indicated presence of an LTFU clinic; however, LTFU care models varied with respect to services provided, specialist availability, type of patients served, and staffing. Among 55% of programs without an LTFU clinic, 100% agreed that allogeneic HCT survivors have unique needs separate from graft-versus-host disease and that complications could arise during the transition of care either from pediatric to adult settings or away from the HCT center. Lack of expertise, logistics, financial issues, and the observation that 84% of individual practitioners prefer to provide survivorship care were the identified obstacles to establishing new LTFU clinics. The ASBMT hopes that policymakers, HCT providers, and institutions will benefit from the results of this survey and recommends that delivering guidelines-driven screening and expert management of late effects is the goal of first-rate HCT survivorship care.}

Specifically, radio frequency identification (RFID) devices are used for converting various resources into smart manufacturing objects (SMOs) and their interactions thus are able to real-time reflect the production operations and behaviors. By innovatively using a laser-scanner in the shopfloor, iVTP is able to real-time display the movements of various SMOs and twin the real-time RFID data to show their states. A Cloud-based system architecture which enables all the services packaged and deployed in a Cloud allows typical end-users to easily define their production logics, download useful services, and develop their customized services. Several demonstrative scenarios are presented to show how iVTP can facilitate the typical decision-making, production and logistics operations in a smart factory.}

However, because of the steady growth of e-commerce and same-day delivery services, new city logistics approaches will also be required to deal with last-mile parcel delivery challenges. We focus on modeling a variation of the people and freight integrated transportation problem (PFIT problem) in which both passenger and parcel requests are pooled in mixed-purpose compartmentalized SAVs. Such vehicles are supposed to combine freight and passenger overlapping journeys on the shared mobility infrastructure network. We formally address the problem as the share-a-ride with parcel lockers problem (SARPLP), implement a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation, and compare the performance of single-purpose and mixed-purpose fleets on 216 transportation scenarios. For 149 scenarios where the solver gaps of the experimental results are negligible (less than 1%), we have shown that mixed-purpose fleets perform in average 11% better than single-purpose fleets. Additionally, the results indicate that the busier is the logistical scenario the better is the performance of the mixed-purpose fleet setting.}

The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) identifies competency areas that categorize clinical and non-clinical skills to develop during postgraduate residency training. To address the competency areas related to non-clinical skills, some residencies have developed programs to focus on interpersonal, leadership, and other professional skills. There is limited guidance in the literature regarding the development or impact of these programs.
Perspective
Professional development series have been implemented at two academic institutions to support the development of non-clinical skills during postgraduate residency training. While these programs address many of the non-clinical skills described in the competency areas, barriers such as program support, logistics, and need for assessment may impede the creation, growth, and success of similar programs.
Implications
With the continued increase in the number of residency programs and trainees, scalability and sustainability are vital components for the success of professional development programs. Assessment of the impact of current programs and further guidance from pharmacy organizations regarding important aspects of professional development would help standardize this process.}

Women presenting with ACS are more often older than men with several pre-existing comorbidities. Although the protective influence of estrogen is notable in younger women, it is over-ridden by the presence of risk factors resulting in worse outcomes for young women with ACS compared with young men. Similarly the morbidity of angiographically nonobstructive disease is greater in women, leading to recurrent angina and hospitalization. ACS resulting from nonatherosclerotic mechanisms requires rigorous investigation for appropriate management. Although cost and logistics deter the routine use of invasive coronary imaging during cardiac catheterization, careful clinical considerations are warranted to guide optimal usage in practice. This review will discuss the insights into sex-based differences obtained chiefly from invasive coronary imaging with a focus on ACS.}

The unique space operations environment and international partner arrangement of the International Space Station (ISS) presents multiple qualifiers in the implementation of NIR safety guidelines. While terrestrial regulatory guidelines are usually applied comprehensively, functional modifications must be made to accommodate the uniqueness of training and health of spaceflight crew as well as the operational logistics present in spaceflight. Additionally, equivalent safety considerations are made where differing jurisdictional safety guidelines are utilized in the process of manufacturing and verifying the safety of hardware. The combination of these qualities requires a proactive and highly adaptive safety oversight that is unique compared to a traditional non-ionizing radiation safety program.}

In this research, we explore the role of providing incentives to customers in order to facilitate leftover returns and improve the sustainability for a real pharmaceutical reverse supply chain (RSC). Moreover, this research investigates the effect of having a proper coordination method between a producer of medications and third-party logistics (3PL) companies, responsible for collecting unwanted medications from customer zones. Finally, a technique is also proposed to share the RSC׳s saving among the producer and the 3PL companies. The experimental results on a real case study indicate that introducing incentives to customers could decrease the amount of uncollected medications from 18% up to 6.5%. Furthermore, having a proper coordination with 3PL companies could guarantee a full medication recovery.}

Long span bridges represent the extreme end of experimental capability, with challenges for logistics and access (due to length and location), instrumentation (due to frequency range, resolution and physical separation of accelerometers) and system identification (because of the extreme low frequencies). Similar challenges apply to other extreme structures such as tall buildings, masts, offshore lighthouses and extended geotechnical structures stretching technology requirements for both instrumentation and signal interpretation. A solution for instrumentation is autonomous ‘wireless’ recorders. The problem with signal interpretation is the reliability of the modal parameter estimates that is particularly challenged with low frequency modes, which ‘third generation’ operational modal analysis procedures offer using Bayesian approaches. The paper describes a preliminary exercise combining both these technologies in readiness for testing two very large bridges, one in China and one in Scotland.}

The distribution system combines full truckload (FTL) routes and less-than-truckload (LTL) shipments. The use of several rates for transportation, as well as the high impact of seasonality implies that, for each shipping date, the number of FTL routes and the cost of LTL shipments should be precisely evaluated. This problem is modeled as a mixed integer linear problem and used as a decision aiding tool on a real case study related to the distribution of horticultural products in France.}

This shift results in concentrated manure production and introduces potential problems associated with its disposal. We analyzed data from 13 permitted CAFOs in southeastern Michigan, including 1187 occurrences of manure application from 12 of the CAFOs with available field-level data. CAFOs applied excess manure nutrients to cropland by applying to fields with soil phosphorus test levels >50 ppm (42% of all cases), applying to soybeans (7% of all cases), over-estimating crop yields in calculating plant nutrient requirements (67% of all cases), and applying beyond what is allowed by state permits (26% of all cases). This represents significant potential for redistribution of manure nutrients. The total amount of manure from all instances of over-application could be redistributed to fertilize over 4775 ha (11,800 acres) per year. Significant barriers to redistribution of manure exist, however, including cost, land availability, crop and soil need, transport logistics, and farmers' reluctance to use manure instead of inorganic fertilizer due to its variable composition. These findings are relevant to the harmful algal bloom and hypoxia issues in Lake Erie, which are driven by excess nutrients, and can be used to better inform science, modeling, and policy in the region.}

In order to better understand the relationships between delivery services, urban environment and staff attitudes, a questionnaire was conducted targeting Newcastle University staff, addressing the purchasing of all goods to be delivered at the work place. A high response rate led to new data on purchasing behaviour. Tentatively we would draw out that the qualitative surveys show willingness amongst the buying population to both suggest and embrace alternatives ideas. We can see that a very small core of people raise most of the orders, and as such it should be possible to influence the majority of orders through them.}

Simulation models represent the spatial structure of the city (network, spatial disparities) and the temporal characteristics of traffic flows. Two measures are addressed by two simulation case studies: delivering on the last mile by cargo bicycles and rerouting of parcels to pick-up points. We show that the last mile by cargo bicycles is suited to reduce the delivery cost; it also has positive impact on the environment. In the case of the pickup points, the additional trips of private customers to these points largely exhaust the benefits from the saved mileage of the delivery vehicles. The present research also critically examines that the micro simulation models are possible to assess the net effects of such innovations once they are applied on a large scale.}

However, the K-means algorithm can be affected by factors such as the initial choice of centroids and can readily become trapped in a local optimum. In this paper, we propose an improved K-means clustering algorithm that is augmented by a Tabu Search strategy, and which is better adapted to meet the needs of big data applications. Our design focuses on enhancements to take advantage of parallel processing based on the Spark framework. Computational experiments demonstrate the superiority of our parallel Tabu Search based clustering algorithm over a widely used version of the K-means approach embodied in the parallel Spark MLlib system, comparing the algorithms in terms of scalability, accuracy, and effectiveness.}

In addition to these circumstances, aid agencies in developing countries are often confronted with poor or non-existent infrastructure that is further disrupted in case of disasters, i.e., destroyed roads and debris-covered areas which hinder medical teams in reaching remote locations. As the supply via trucks and helicopters is not applicable in this situation, alternative means of transport have to be considered. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are receiving increased attention by humanitarian organizations as they can help overcoming last-mile distribution problems, i.e., inaccessibility to cut-off regions. This paper considers drone applications in last-mile distribution in humanitarian logistics and presents an optimization model for the delivery of multiple packages of light-weight relief items (e.g. vaccine, water purification tablets, etc.) via drones to a certain number of remote locations within a disaster prone area. The objective of the model is to minimize the total travelling distance (or time/cost) of the drone under payload and energy constraints while recharging stations are installed to allow the extension of the operating distance of the drone. The implementation of different priority policies is discussed. The model is solved as a mixed integer linear program and illustrated numerically with different scenarios.}

An intermodal transport could be the potential solution for reduction of logistics cost, including an acceleration of product flow, by way of dry port, where is regarded as a key component of combined transport. To promote a dry port in southern Thailand, the aim of this study is to propose an integrated method based on multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) for selecting its best location. Thus, a new hybrid CFA-MACBETH-PROMETHEE model is presented. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) is applied to determine loads for sorting out the importance of criteria and also investigate the relationship of logistic policy and geographical determination of dry port establishment. Later, measuring attractiveness by a categorical based evaluation technique (MACBETH) is utilized to build weights of those criteria. Eventually, preference ranking organization method for enrichment of evaluations (PROMETHEE) is engaged to rank from the most to least attractive alternatives of dry port. In this study, results indicate that Phatthalung railway station is the most attractive location for being a new dry port.}

The proposed mathematical model is solved using an exact algorithm. Since the exact algorithm suffers from long CPU time, a Lagrangian decomposition heuristic combined with particle swarm optimization (LD-PSO) algorithm is proposed, which performs well for small size waves. To solve large-scale problems, a hybrid parallel simulated annealing and ant colony optimization (PSA-ACO) is presented. The proposed methods are tested using the warehouse data. The results are compared against the minimum makespan impact (MMI) heuristic that is currently being used in the warehouse and a state-of-the-art variable neighborhood descent (VND). While PSA-ACO slightly outperforms VND, for picking large waves, PSA-ACO and VND can improve the makespan by approximately 7.8% and 6.9% over MMI respectively. Numerical experiments show that increasing number of pickers and picking capacity has a greater impact on reducing makespan when the ratio of orders to number of pickers or picking capacity is high.}

The motivation to consider the time dependency factor is that it enables to have better approximations to many problems arising from practice. In this paper, we consider the Time-Dependent Traveling Salesman Problem with Time Windows (TDTSP-TW), where the time dependence is captured by considering variable average travel speeds. We propose an Integer Linear Programming model for the problem and develop an exact algorithm, which is compared on benchmark instances with another approach from the related literature. The results show that the approach is able to solve instances with up to 40 customers.}

Nevertheless, the translation of breakthrough regenerative medicine innovations remains a bit far to realization. Regenerative medicine products and procedures fall beyond translational challenges in the context of clinical validation, regulatory issues, manufacturing challenges, and scale-up deployment, and logistics optimization. There are specific aspects related to payment, reimbursement, commissioning, and financial risks and rewards, among many others, which can add complexity to clinical adoption. Indeed, conventional payment and financing models are resulting poorly suited for one-single dose administration therapies focused on curative treatments.

Yet research that links industrial agglomeration with rail transit is scant—what types of industries are likely to cluster near rail stations? To what extent can rail transit access be seen as having an influence on industrial agglomeration? And how do these interactions vary as rail transit proximity increases? To answer these and related questions, we investigate the relationship between industrial agglomeration and rail transit in the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area using the Longitudinal Employer Dynamics (LEHD) employment data from 2014 at the census block level. First, we use the Local Indicator of Spatial Association statistics (LISA) tests to identify industrial agglomeration patterns within the study area. We then use logistics models to reveal the relationship between rail transit proximity and industrial agglomeration. Our study finds that the impacts of rail transit on industrial agglomeration, in terms of magnitudes and signs, are mixed across industries. The varying results suggest that the benefits of rail transit access exhibit considerable demand from certain industry sectors including the manufacturing, knowledge, and services industries, while exerting weaker forces in pulling agglomeration in its immediate environs among other industries (including the retail trade sector). In practice, these results are useful for justifying evidence-based rail transit planning.}

abstract = {Introduction
The outcomes of organ transplantation activities are greatly affected by the ability to haul organs and medical teams quickly and safely. Organ allocation and usage criteria have greatly improved over time, whereas the same result has not been achieved so far from the transport point of view. Safety and the highest level of service and efficiency must be reached to grant transplant recipients the healthiest outcome.
Objectives
The Italian National Transplant Centre (CNT), in partnership with the regions and the University of Bologna, has promoted a thorough analysis of all stages of organ transportation logistics chains to produce homogeneous and shared guidelines throughout the national territory, capable of ensuring safety, reliability, and sustainability at the highest levels.
Methods
The mapping of all 44 transplant centers and the pertaining airport network has been implemented. An analysis of technical requirements among organ shipping agents at both national and international level has been promoted. A national campaign of real-time monitoring of organ transport activities at all stages of the supply chain has been implemented. Parameters investigated have been hospital and region of both origin and destination, number and type of organs involved, transport type (with or without medical team), stations of arrival and departure, and shipping agents, as well as actual times of activities involved.
Results
National guidelines have been issued to select organ storage units and shipping agents on the basis of evaluation of efficiency, reliability, and equipment with reference to organ type and ischemia time. Guidelines provide EU-level standards on technical equipment of aircrafts, professional requirements of shipping agencies and cabin crew, and requirements on service provision, including pricing criteria.
Conclusions
The introduction in the Italian legislation of guidelines issuing minimum requirements on topics such as the medical team, packaging, labeling, safety and integrity, identification, real-time monitoring of temperature, and traceability of the organ during the logistics chain is deemed a valid response to the necessity of improving safety, reliability, and sustainability of organ transplantation activities in Italy.}

abstract = {Rural transportation networks are highly susceptible to geohazards such as earthquakes and landslides. Indirect losses can be severe because the breakdown of a transportation network aggravates rescue, supply, and other recovery activities. The operations and logistics of rural networks that are under seismic risks must be managed using the limited resources specifically in developing countries. We propose a methodology to evaluate road recovery strategies for restoring connectivity after blockages due to earthquakes and earthquake-triggered landslides. This paper gives insight into the recovery process, which can be used by decision-makers for enhancing resilience and supplying immediate relief to rural areas. The proposed framework has four steps: 1) identification of strategies for increasing recovery performance, 2) determination of graph-based metrics to represent network connectivity, 3) applying topology-based and Monte Carlo simulations to each strategy, and 4) analysis of recovery times to compare these resilience-enhancement strategies. The methodology was tested using a case study from Sindhupalchok District, Nepal, a region that was severely affected by the Gorkha earthquake in 2015. The closed road segments and recovery times were determined through field surveys with locals and governmental authorities, and by investigating the intensity of earthquake-triggered landslides. Our results showed that the proposed approach provides information about the recovery behavior of road networks and simplifies the evaluation process. It is robust enough to extend and assess decision-makers’ preferences for improving resilience.}

abstract = {At a biogas plant, a truck driver was overcome by toxic fumes while unloading food waste slurry collected at sites that operate a shredder and tank system. Trucks unload their cargo into a feedstock pit. While unloading, hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide and possibly other toxic gases were released. Ventilation systems were overwhelmed. The driver narrowly escaped death. Several would-be rescuers collapsed. Under marginally different conditions, this accident could have led to five fatalities. The case offers a rich account of the actions of fellow workers who with stubborn determination sought to extract the unconscious driver. Even after having collapsed themselves, been extracted and recovered, they re-entered the building — amazingly still without realizing the gas danger. The article argues that long retention time in the logistics chain may alter the hazard profile of food waste slurry. This emerging risk appears overlooked and under-studied. The case exposes insufficient attention to safety in the rapidly expanding biogas sector. The biogas plant was unprepared. The investigation was quick, superficial and woefully inadequate. Root causes were not identified. Broad information sharing is limited or non-existent.}

abstract = {Rollout algorithms lead to effective heuristics for the single vehicle routing problem with stochastic demands (VRPSD), a prototypical model of logistics under uncertainty. However, they can be computationally intensive. To reduce their run time, we introduce a novel approach to approximate the expected cost of a route when executing any rollout algorithm for VRPSD with restocking. With a sufficiently large number of customers its theoretical speed-up factor is of big-o order 1/3. On a set of instances from the literature, our proposed technique applied to a known rollout algorithm and three variants thereof achieves speed-up factors that range from 0.26 to 0.34 when there are more than fifty customers, degrading only marginally the quality of the resulting routes. Our method also applies to the a priori case, in which case it is exact.}

This problem is relevant due to its applications in fields such as emergency logistics, transportation, wireless network and computing, among others. This paper presents the first two tractable integer formulations capable of solving instances with up to 44 nodes and two versions of an Iterated Greedy procedure for dealing with larger instances. Experimental results show that both formulations obtain optimal solutions in a reasonable amount of computational time. Regarding the two metaheuristic procedures, they were able to reach optimal and best known solutions and, in some cases, outperform the bounds obtained by exact methods for tested instances with up to 199 customers. Using larger instances, the proposed metaheuristics showed competitive results when compared to the best known values reported in the literature, with a significant reduction in computational time.}

The first order, modified Gompertz and logistics models were used to obtain the kinetic parameters of the biogas production process. Results indicate the chemical composition of the algae substrate could be written as C316H613O289N13S1, with a theoretical methane yield of 336 ± 0.86 L CH4 kg VS−1. Experimental methane yield obtained from the reactors for 25, 35, 45, and 55 °C were 318 ± 1.58, 293 ± 1.11, 271 ± 0.98 and 352 ± 0.63 mL CH4/gVS respectively. Their R2 > 0.90 indicate both models fits well for predicating kinetics of methane production. The lowest kh (0.31), high biodegradability index (0.96) and lag time (9.3–11.7 days) were obtained for 55 °C.}

Because of Germany's high demand for biofuels, the production and distribution of levulinic acid and bioethanol by wheat straw is studied. An illustrative bio-based supply chain model is developed and implemented in the Advanced Interactive Multidimensional Modeling (AIMMS) software. Then, this model is used to study the logistics, network optimization, transportation and inventory management, and the resulting environmental and economic impacts. In the end, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to evaluate the influence of key model parameters on these impacts. The results showed that a wheat straw supply chain network is profitable in the area of Bremen and Lower Saxony even though the bioproducts demand is not fully covered and that the transportation costs did not have a strong impact on the supply chain network.}

With the projection of future vehicle stock in China, we calculated the fuel demand and direct CO2 emission from 2015 to 2050 for every five-year period and made an assessment on the potential of different fuel pathways to reduce direct CO2 emission and fuel demand with the methodology established. This study showed that the growth of vehicle stock will reach its saturation point in about 2045. As projected, China’s vehicle population will reach 278, 481, and 546 million by 2020, 2030, and 2050 respectively. This study also shows that the fuel demand for vehicles will keep increasing until its peak in 2030, and then decline until 2050. Natural gas vehicles (NGVs) contribute the most to the energy saving and CO2 emissions reduction in the short term before 2020, while in the medium and long term, new energy vehicles, especially electric vehicles (EVs), will contribute more significantly and account the main proportion of the reduction.}

This paper first, illustrated a material flow of used mobile phones with quantitative information. Then, a sensitivity analysis was applied to clarify important factors in reducing material consumption and environmental impact. Result showed that transportation length has a big influence on environmental impact. Thus, an efficient logistics can be a key in reducing environmental impact. The material flow showed that a big portion of used phones are stored in homes. To collect such stored mobile phones, official network called MRN (mobile phone network) is the best strategy in reducing material consumption and avoiding problems regarding outflow. Finally, the paper concluded that sensitivity analysis of material flow is a useful method in determining proper strategy of treatment of used products.}
