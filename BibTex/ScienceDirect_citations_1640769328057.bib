abstract = {In this study we examine the effects of horizontal inter-organizational arrangements on inventory costs for hospitals facing two key environmental conditions, namely the logistics services infrastructure where the hospital is located and the demand uncertainty for clinical requirements that a hospital experiences. Utilizing detailed data from hospitals in the State of California, we investigated the potential mitigating effects of affiliation with multi-hospital systems while controlling for service performance. We argue that these arrangements potentially influence managers' confidence in their supply chains, which in turn impacts inventory accumulation. Results suggest that while affiliation with local, regional, and national systems has mitigating effects under weak logistics services infrastructure, the mitigating effect is greatest for affiliation in local systems. The results also point to potential for improved operating efficiency with system affiliation, a factor that is often not considered in policy discussions regarding hospital system formation. Theoretical and managerial implications are discussed.}

Our interest in this study is to analyse the benefits of horizontal collaboration related to perishability, energy use (CO2 emissions) from transportation operations and logistics costs in the Inventory Routing Problem (IRP) with multiple suppliers and customers by developing a decision support model that can address these concerns. The proposed model allows us to analyse the benefits of horizontal collaboration in the IRP with respect to several Key Performance Indicators, i.e., emissions, driving time, total cost comprised of routing (fuel and wage cost), inventory and waste cost given an uncertain demand. A case study on the distribution operations of two suppliers, where the first supplier produces figs and the second supplier produces cherries, shows the applicability of the model to a real-life problem. The results show that horizontal collaboration among the suppliers contributes to the decrease of aggregated total cost and emissions in the logistics system. The obtained gains are sensitive to the changes in parameters such as supplier size or maximum product shelf life. According to experiments, the aggregated total cost benefit from cooperation varies in a range of about 4–24% and the aggregated total emission benefit varies in a range of about 8–33% compared to the case where horizontal collaboration does not exist.}

abstract = {Disturbances are inevitable and ubiquitous in the precast supply chain. Systematic evaluations of the impact of individual disturbances to prioritize the prevention of various disturbances are critical for realizing the full potential of logistical profits. This is especially true when the disturbance prevention budget is insufficient. Whereas, existing studies focused primarily on single disturbance analyses or precautions evaluation. This study proposes an overall disturbance evaluation model to assess the uncertainty of precast supply chain. The model is developed using ARENA-based discrete event simulation methods, and aims to address the lack of systematic multiple disturbances evaluation before the implementation of precaution measures. The model constructs include a real-world precast supply chain environment which considers four categories of disturbances derived from suppliers, manufacturers, logistics, and customers. In the model, the importance of disturbance is evaluated from both operational and economic perspectives, and the upper bound for the implementation cost of each precaution measure is provided. Finally, eleven scenarios with different levels of exposure to disturbances are investigated to test the validity of the proposed approach. Numerical results indicate that system failure is the most critical disturbance in this precast supply chain, followed by PC quality problem, PC reproduction owing to repair failure, and the material quality problem. The findings could facilitate the multiple disturbance management in the precast supply chain.}

However, this technology requires increasing cyanide production to obtain desirable recovery efficiency.

In this study, results showed that LB medium did not produce highest yield of cyanide. Under optimal culture conditions (25 °C, pH 7.5), the maximum cyanide yield of the optimized medium (containing tryptone 6 g/L and yeast extract 5 g/L) was 1.5 times as high as that of LB medium. In addition, kinetics and relationship of cell growth and cyanide production was studied. Data of cell growth fitted logistics model well. Allometric model was demonstrated effective in describing relationship between cell growth and cyanide production. By inserting logistics equation into allometric equation, we got a novel hybrid equation containing five parameters. Kinetic data for cyanide production were well fitted to the new model. Model parameters reflected both cell growth and cyanide production process.}

The paper presents an approach to robust optimization of logistics vehicle routes in urban areas on the basis of estimated short-term traffic time forecasts in a selected area of the urban road network. The forecast values of optimization parameters have been determined using the spectral analysis model, taking into account the forecast uncertainty degree. The robust counterparts approach of uncertain bi-criteria shortest path problem formulation is used to determining the robust routes for logistics vehicles in the urban network. The uncertainty set is created on the basis of forecast travel times in chosen sections, estimated by means of spectral analysis. The advantages and the characteristics are exemplified in the actual Krakow road network. The obtained data have been compared with classic approach wherein it is assumed that the optimization parameters are certain and accurate. The results obtained in the simulation example indicate that use of forecasting techniques with robust optimization models has a positive impact on the quality of final solutions.}

Vector control programmes have failed to contain the disease and worst of all, no specific treatment is available at the moment. Thereby, this pushes the demand for a dengue vaccine as a long-term protective approach. Despite there are numerous vaccine candidates ahead, they could be held back by different aspects in promoting vaccine implementation. Particularly for developing nations, logistics and cost are the major hurdles that need to be addressed in order to provide a quick yet affordable medical relief. As an alternative, plant-based vaccine production system is able to offer an attractive prospect given to its advantages of biocontainment warranty, low operation cost, rapid scalability and logistics flexibility.

abstract = {A collaborative multiple-center vehicle routing problem (CMCVRP) is a multi-constraint combinatorial and game optimization issue containing both vehicle routing optimization and profit distribution procedures. The CMCVRP is generally used to study the logistics network structure adjustment from a non-optimal network structure to a collaborative multiple DCs network optimization structure. The optimization of CMCVR can effectively improve vehicle loading rate and reduce the crisscross transportation phenomenon. Designing a reasonable profit distribution mechanism is a critical step of CMCVR optimization. Collaboration can be organized through a negotiation process by a logistics service provider. This paper establishes an integer-programming model that contains transportation costs among distribution centers (DCs) and vehicle routing costs in each DC to minimize the total costs of CMCVRP. A multi-phase hybrid approach with clustering, dynamic programming, and heuristic algorithm is presented to solve the model formulation. The clustering procedure increases the likelihood that the solution will converge to an optimal value, between-route operations (relocate, 2-opt* exchange, and swap move) in the heuristic algorithm will improve the initial solution, and the within-route (dynamic programming) procedure will calculate a good feasible solution for each vehicle route. Both between- and within-route operations are recursively executed to find the best solution. Profit distribution plans are then established using the improved Shapley value model. Optimal sequential coalitions are selected based on strictly monotonic path, cost reduction model, and best strategy of sequential coalition selection in cooperative game theory. An empirical study in Chongqing, China suggests that the proposed approach outperforms other algorithms, and the best sequential coalition can be selected and adjusted to increase the negotiation power for network optimization of logistics distribution.}

abstract = {Vendor-managed inventory (VMI) is a common inventory management policy which allows the vendor to manage the buyer's inventory based on the information shared in the course of supply chain management. One challenge in VMI is that both the vendor and buyer are manufacturers who try to achieve an inventory as small as possible or even a zero inventory; it is therefore difficult to manage inventory coordination between them. This paper considers a decentralized VMI problem in a three-echelon supply chain network in which multiple distributors (third-party logistics companies) are selected to balance the inventory between a vendor (manufacturer) and multiple buyers (manufacturers). To handle this issue, this paper first proposes a tri-level decision model to describe the decentralized VMI problem, which allows us to examine how decision members coordinate with each other in respect of decentralized VMI decision-making in a predetermined sequence. We then turn our attention to the geometry of the solution space and present a vertex enumeration algorithm to solve the resulting tri-level decision model. Lastly, a computational study is developed to illustrate how the proposed tri-level decision model and solution approach can handle the decentralized VMI problem. The results indicate that the proposed tri-level decision-making techniques provide a practical way to design a novel manufacturer-manufacturer (vendor-buyer) VMI system where third-party logistics are involved.}

Energy consumption and system efficiency are assessed for livestock products based on both the Final and Useful Energy, based on the Brazilian Useful Energy Balance. An overview of the country legislation and government ordinances are presented, followed by R&D actions and industrial structure. Data assessment shows an expanding of the volumetric capacity, from 5.7 mm3 in 2010 to 16.0 mm3 in 2014, but still below the required capacity of 54.6 mm3, calculated in this paper. The 38.5 mm3 deficit is an opportunity for new industrial investment followed by an effort in quality improvement of the installed infrastructure. Refrigerated vehicle fleet is estimated to be around 7500 vehicles for internal distribution, with a 43% share for long-haul trunks and 57% for short-haul trunks. Electricity drives the cold chain, with 24.5 TJ in 2014. The energy efficiency index indicates an improvement on the cold chain quality due to replacement of old refrigerated systems by new ones. An overview of the Brazilian legislation, composed by a set of laws and ordinances, shows a relation between different actors, as regulation agencies, heath ministry, industrial and civil sectors, regarding different aspects of the cold chain.

We submit that the inconclusiveness in the relationship between lean and green arises from not investigating it from a holistic standpoint. In this study, we address this gap by adjudging the relationship of lean systems with holistic supply chain context which includes sourcing, production and logistics. The proposed hypotheses are grounded in the resource-based view of the firm. We examine the relationship in the context of emerging economy such as India. Results obtained using structural equation modelling method indicates that lean implementation positively influences the implementation of sustainability practices for supplier selection and production but negatively impacts sustainability practices for delivery and logistic services. We conclude that the relationship between lean management and sustainable supply chain management is not straightforward. Gain at some place may cause loss at other places. Therefore, the net impact must be seen in totality and segmented analysis is the cause of inconclusive findings.}

abstract = {Considering that the transport sector is responsible for 30% of the CO2 emissions in the EU, reaching up to 40% in urban areas, the efforts for technological improvements and innovation in transportation have been increasing during the last few decades. It is evident that urban freight distribution requires innovative solutions that are capable of improving the efficiency of transport whilst promoting innovative use of renewable energy, thus reducing energy consumption and associated GHG emissions while adopting and not stifling economic development. In this context, six Mediterranean cities (Barcelona, Bologna, Piraeus, Rijeka and Valencia)) collaborated with the purpose of contributing to the improvement of energy efficiency on urban freight transport as part of the SMILE Project (2015) (SMart green Innovative urban Logistics Models for Energy efficient mediterranean cities project), funded by the MED Programme. The SMILE project aims to improve the energy efficiency of Mediterranean cities through the promotion of innovative ‘green’ and cost effective solutions for urban freight logistics, addressing the target of green and smart urban development. This paper shows the results of the live test of smart city urban logistics solutions in the cities of Barcelona and Valencia that consisted of combining the use of electric tricycles and Transhipment terminals (or Urban Consolidation Centres) for the last-mile delivery of parcels and small shipments. A thoughtful analysis of the quantitative outcomes of the pilot test in both cities are presented from different perspectives: economical, operational, energy efficiency, environmental and social.}

abstract = {The decision of where to locate a dry port requires the analysis of the whole logistics supply chain, with the objective of transferring the largest volume of goods possible from road to more energy efficient means of transport, like rail or Short Sea Shipping, that are less harmful to the environment. However, such decision ought to cope also with the sustainability of the site inland. The objective of this article is to investigate the variables influencing sustainability of dry port location and how this sustainability can be evaluated. We propose a methodology based on Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) and Bayesian Networks (BNs). MCDA is used as a way to establish a scoring, whilst BNs were chosen to eliminate arbitrariness in setting the weightings using a technique that allows us to prioritize each variable according to the relationships established in the set of variables. In order to determine the relationships between all the variables involved in the decision, giving us the importance of each factor and variable, we built a K2 BN algorithm. To obtain the scores of each variable, we used a complete cartography analysed by ArcGIS. As case studies, the sustainability of all of the 10 existing dry ports in Spain has been evaluated. In this set of logistics platforms, we found that the most important variables for achieving sustainability are those related to environmental protection, so the sustainability of the locations requires a great respect for the natural environment and the urban environment in which they are framed.}

As a metaphor of the digital internet, the concept of PI aims to integrate independent logistics networks into a global, open, interconnected system. Prior research shows that the new organization can reduce transportation cost through flow consolidation. Continuing along these lines, this paper examines how PI deal with disruption problems at hubs as well as the resilience of such an open logistics system. To attain this, a multi-agent based simulation model is developed. Disruptions at hubs are considered and formulated by a two-state Markov process, with a probability of breakdown αi and a probability of repair βi. Faced with the disruptions, two PI-based transportation planning strategies are proposed and investigated: risk avoidance and risk-taking. Results of experimentation on fast-moving consumer goods (FMCGs) chains in France suggest that PI can provide better performance on resilience in freight transportation. This paper also indicates a novel approach to build a resilient distribution system.}

In contrast, men are more likely than women to have frequent higher order interactions, such as discussing ideas and participating in research. These findings introduce a new typology of student-faculty interaction and contribute to our understanding of gendered pathways through higher education.}

Although it seems that an increasing number of firms is seeing environmental sustainability as a source of competitive advantage, there is a large gap of research focusing explicitly on the connection between competitive strategy and GSCM. It is also necessary to examine GSCM practices in several operational contexts. This article refines the competitive strategy approach and examines external GSCM strategies along the tiers of supply chain from the perspective of logistics users and providers using a dataset of 128 manufacturing, 110 trading and 144 logistics firms operating in Finland. The results reveal a connection between competitive strategy and GSCM strategy. Marketing differentiators and firms pursuing hybrid strategies tend to use more advanced GSCM strategies to manage the environmental performance of their suppliers. For them, GSCM seems to be a way to differentiate products and services, and to minimise the risk of potential losses resulting from poor environmental performance by suppliers. The results highlight the need to understand the role of competitive strategy in GSCM adoption, both in academia and in business.}

The GSCM implementation and performance assessment is relatively important for survival in an ever-increasingly competitive environment. Within the circular economy context; companies that aim to improve GSCM must constantly monitor their performance. In order to integrate the circular economy concept into GSCM, it is required to achieve an optimal balance of environmental, economic, logistics, organizational, and marketing performance indicators. However, in the literature, these indicators were investigated separately in terms of GSCM performance assessment, therefore, to achieve this optimal balance, it is necessary to assess these different indicators. Within this context, the aim of this paper is to propose a new holistic conceptual GSCM performance assessment framework which integrates environmental, economic, logistics, operational, organizational and marketing performance. The framework has three-dimensional hierarchy which includes the main criteria, sub-criteria, and the measures for the GSCM performance assessment which have great significance to implement effective GSCM.}

Thus far, available literature on the EOQ model do not consider any situation where both market demand and acquisition quantity are uncertain. Therefore, this work develops an evolved environmental sustainability EOQ (EES-EOQ) model to overcome the limitations of the classical EOQ model. Employing the remanufacture-up-to ratio to control the production quantity indirectly, we deduce three optimal strategies: (I) minimize the inventory cost, (II) maximize the overall environmental benefit in a dedicated remanufacturing model, and (III) coordinate forward logistics and reverse logistics to achieve environment optimization in the combined remanufacturing model. With stochastic analysis, we mathematically prove the existence and uniqueness of the optimal remanufacture-up-to ratio in each strategy. Validated by numerical experiments and sensitivity analysis, we demonstrate that the replenishment of new products in the combined model can effectively eliminate the risks of being out of stock and strike an optimal balance between uncertain supply and demand. This study provides the theoretical foundation for remanufacturers to develop optimal remanufacturing strategies for mitigating environmental issues caused by excessive carbon emissions.}

From its initial function of a point of transit, Panama became a tollbooth with the setting of the Panama Canal mostly servicing intercoastal networks. Then, with the growth of transpacific trade and increasing ship sizes Panama became a major transshipment hub, a process facilitated by reforms of its port governance with setting of a landlord port authority model and concessions to private terminal operators. With the emergence of Panama as a logistics platform, governance has gone beyond the realm of the port. The setting of a national Logistics Cabinet in 2014 is illustrative of that trend aiming at coordinating the operations of the Panama Canal (with its expanded locks), port activities focusing on transshipment and the setting of port centric logistics zones. Still, the intermediary location of Panama is facing some risk in the post expansion era since shipping lines are no longer forced to use Panama and could elect for other transshipment hubs. In light of the emerging commercial context, it remains to be seen how the connectivity of Panama will fit within global supply chain strategies.}

Studies conducted by various international and national organizations led by the FAO indicated that about one third of all food produced on the planet and about a half of all fruit and vegetables (F&V) are lost and not consumed. FLW occurs during five key stages of the food supply chain: agricultural production, postharvest handling and storage, processing, distribution, and consumption. Large portions of FLW in developed countries occur during retail and consumption, and are largely related to logistic management operations and consumer behaviors. In light of the great importance of FLW reduction, the United Nations set up in September 2015 an ambitious goal to halve per capita global food waste by 2030, and this decision was adapted by the US Federal Government, the EU Parliament, and many other countries. This first Adel Kader review article is dedicated to the subject of F&V losses during retail and consumption, and contains the following chapters: 1) Introduction of the problem of global food losses; 2) Quantifications of F&V losses during retail and consumption in the UK, US and other countries; 3) Causes and consumer decisions related to F&V wastage; 4) Emerging new technologies for prevention of F&V losses, including advances in logistics and cold chain management, retail packaging and technological innovations; 5) Other means to reduce F&V losses, including consumer awareness campaigns, advertisement of home storage instructions and policy and legislative measures. Due to the great importance of reducing F&V losses, we encourage postharvest researchers to become more engaged with logistics and food supply-chain operations, and to conduct multidisciplinary research incorporating consumer behavior studies into postharvest research.}

To reduce the effect on the schedule and cost performance of construction projects, managers should allocate limited material among activities effectively. Motivated by observations of construction practices, this paper investigates the integration of supply logistics and site logistics issues and develops a framework to model inventory replenishment and allocation decisions jointly. On the basis of the activity feature information (e.g., schedule, cost, and demand), we propose five allocation policies to support the integrated inventory management process: schedule-based, cost-based, demand-based, schedule-cost-based, and schedule-demand-based policies. Meanwhile, a genetic algorithm (GA)-based simulation optimization method is utilized to solve the integrated inventory model and find the optimal inventory level under a given allocation policy. Based on a large set of fictitious project networks with different path difference (PD), a computational analysis is conducted to make detailed interpolicy comparisons. It is shown that for a project network with a small (or large) PD value, the schedule-based (or schedule-cost-based) policy is the most appropriate choice.}

This paper considers a Home Health Care Routing Problem with stochastic travel and service time, which comes from the logistics practice of the home health care company. A stochastic programming model with recourse (SPR) is proposed, the Hybrid Genetic Algorithm (HGA) and stochastic simulation method are integrated to solve the proposed model. Three series of experiments are carried out to evaluate the model. Firstly, the SPR model is reduced to the deterministic one, experimental results for the related instances validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed HGA. Then HGA and stochastic simulation are integrated to solve the stochastic model. Comparisons between the solutions obtained by stochastic model and deterministic one validate the reasonable and robustness of considering the stochastic travel and service time. This research will help HHC companies to make appropriate decisions when arranging their vehicle routes.}

In such a framework, it turns out that logistics inevitably has to aim at avoiding or, at least, reducing, all the possible inefficiencies that could emerge during the execution of the various activities that are needed to deliver a required product to a customer. These inefficiencies could be, among others, delays in the searching of the needed product code within a warehouse, errors in the retrieval or in the picking of an item, waste of time for carts or for operators’ travelling activity, lack of availability of warehouse facilities and devices due to failures and breakdowns. Of course, the overcome of the inefficiencies has to pass through the retrieval of the information that can be useful to increase the awareness of such existing lacks. For example, it would be important to have the data related to the movements of resources and to objects handling. In this paper, an innovative indoor positioning system is presented. Based on a real-time indoor location technology using Ultra Wide Band, it can be used for having an effective overview of a logistic system. After an introduction of the possible technologies for indoor positioning and tracking, the configuration of the system is showed, together with a description of a simple test and of an industrial application.

abstract = {A plan to achieve self-sufficiency in manufacturing biologicals for public health has been structured for the last 40 years in Brazil, in the context of a reform in the health system. Industrial plants of the national public laboratories have been modernized, and a program for reducing morbidity and mortality of venomous snakebite has been created, as part of the National Epidemiological Surveillance System. The epidemiological data are essential to plan for the antivenom production of 400,000 vials of snake antivenoms per year, and the acquisition by the Ministry of Health, which is the exclusive purchaser in the country. Distribution is decentralized to reach hospitals in almost 3000 municipalities, and to provide free of charge antivenom treatment. The National Sanitary Surveillance Agency organized the regulatory environment to implement rules and supervise compliance of GMP procedures, elevating the quality of the biologicals that are produced, as well as reducing the costs in production. Despite all the advances in the health system, antivenom availability and accessibility is not uniform in regards to the most vulnerable parts of the populations, which inhabit remote areas in the Brazilian Amazon region. Better logistics and transportation of liquid form antivenoms is an issue to be addressed and realistic and comprehensive health programs for indigenous groups should be effectively structured, in order to reduce the high morbidity and mortality rates associated with snakebite envenoming.}

In traditional systems, transportation streams from one echelon of the supply chain to the next. Systems that are more flexible allow transshipment movements within an echelon, enabling the sharing of inventories among wholesalers and consequently reducing inventories and handling costs without changing the service level. This paper introduces a multi-period, multi-product Inventory-Routing Problem with planned Transshipment (IRPT). The novelty with regard to existing approaches is that transshipment movements are performed by the same vehicles that are distributing from the factory, meaning that they are subjected to the same capacity, time and cost restrictions. We present an exact formulation and develop a metaheuristic for the problem. The methods are applied to a real large-scale Brazilian retail industry producing a reduction of 9% in logistics costs and 70% in inventory level compared to the existing operation.}

The number of studies available in the literature on reverse logistics is a good indicator of its significance. Almost all of the available studies deal with a single product that is collected and recovered as a whole unit. In reality, manufacturing firms produce multiple products and spare parts. When a product reaches its end-of-life, the product and the spare parts produced to service it over its operational life are collected and then returned to the manufacturer for possible recovery (e.g., reuse, remanufacturing, and repairing). In most cases, returned items are disassembled to recover useful components that could be reused in producing new items or remanufactured ones, after which are introduced into the market as-good-as new. This paper develops a mathematical model for a system where a product (new or remanufactured) and its spare parts are returned and disassembled, where applicable, for recovery. The demand for the product and spare parts are met from production, remanufacturing and inspection/disassembly center. This paper identifies which strategy (pure remanufacturing, pure production or mixed) is more viable. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the behavior of the model and to draw some insights.}

Since transportation costs constitute one of the largest forms of expenditure in the HHC industry, it is of importance to research the optimization of the HHC logistics. This paper considers an HHC routing problem with stochastic travel and service times, which comes from the logistics practice of HHC companies. A Stochastic Programming model with Recourse (SPR model) is proposed based on the specific structure of the supply chain. Three series of experiments are carried out to evaluate the model. Firstly, the SPR model is reduced to the deterministic one, and five approaches (Gurobi Solver, Hybrid Genetic Algorithm, Simulated Annealing, Bat Algorithm and Firefly Algorithm) are respectively implemented to solve the deterministic model. The SPR model is finally solved by the proposed SA-based heuristic algorithm. Evaluation of the solutions achieved by the two models highlights the advantages of considering stochastic travel and service times. Finally, a case study is given to explain how the SPR model works for an HHC company. This research will help HHC companies to make appropriate decisions when planning their vehicle routes.}

Innovative technological developments are leading to smart ways for producing food more efficiently and of higher quality. Nevertheless, lots of perishable goods are wasted because of inefficiencies during the subsequent transport process. The amount of wastage could be reduced via better planning and control of transport activities. Perishable goods logistics can be better supported by real-time information of goods and the emerging concept of synchromodality, as sensing and communication technology develops. In this paper a decision making system is proposed for perishable goods logistics service providers to reduce loss of freshness using synchromodal transport. The approach starts from the perspective of individual containers and the different types of equipment/vehicles used to transport these containers. With both the perishing feature and the transport situations of perishable goods considered, the controller decides when and where containers with such goods should be moved to. Simulation experiments illustrate how the approach could improve the quality and reduce the operation time during transport processes.}

Estimates of industrial, non-industrial reported, illegal/unreported (IUU) and discards reveal changes in country dominance, catch composition and fishing gear use. Catch of industrial and non-industrial marine fishing by year, fishing country, taxa and gear by 30-min spatial cell broken to reported, IUU and discards is available. Results show a historical increase in bottom trawl with corresponding reduction in the landings from seines. Though diverse, global landings are now dominated by demersal and small pelagic species.}

Young drivers are youth who are progressing through the developmental milestone of adolescence, thus youth are experiencing developmental changes in cognitive, physiological and social domains. These developmental changes, combined with driving inexperience, increase the risks associated with driving. Such risks can be further increased in young drivers with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), as these individuals may have difficulties in problem solving, organisational skills, conceptual development, inferences and judgement, and attention and impulse control. Clearly these skills are fundamental for safe driving behaviour. The aim of this study was to understand the driving and licensing experiences of youth with ASD, and the barriers associated with licensure, using Bronfenbrenner’s Social-Ecological Theory (SET), with the sub-theme SET-Individual, as the foundation. A qualitative study analysis of comments written by 117 participants from three groups (101 Individuals with ASD, seven Relations, and nine individuals whose status was Unknown) in five online discussion forums, revealed perceived differences and similarities, between each group, regarding barriers experienced by individuals and/or drivers with ASD. To illustrate, while all three groups recognised the difficulties in licensure for Individuals with ASD, Individuals with ASD appeared to focus on the logistics of licensure, and crashes; Relations focused on their relationship and the ASD characteristics of the Individual; and Unknowns focused on reasons for licensure. The findings reflected the influence of internal structures, interpersonal relations, interrelations between settings, external environments, cultural frameworks, and social-historical changes on driving experiences regarding Individuals’ with ASD, relevant to Bronfenbrenner’s SET.}

We include handling costs at the warehouse and stores as these are main drivers for logistics costs. We find delivery patterns and order-up-to levels, both of which shall remain fixed for a certain time. As especially in retail stochastic non-stationary demand structures are prevalent, we extend the classic joint replenishment problem under dynamic demand by a stochastic yet distribution-free optimization approach based on historical data samples. We formulate a mixed integer linear program using the plant-location formulation and develop several hierarchical decomposition approaches and a genetic algorithm. We consider a cyclic approach for orders, which allows an order at the end of the time horizon to fulfill the demand at the beginning of the time horizon. Using this approach, there is no need for initial inventories to be set as an input; they are are optimized within the model. Furthermore, a metacalibration approach is introduced, which allows an automated setting of input parameters for the genetic algorithm. To derive insights into the performance of the models, random instances are solved and then the most promising models are used for a case study with a European retailer. The results for the controlled test instances are analyzed by a meta-modeling approach that provides insights into performance drivers for the investigated model variants. The average logistics cost savings of our model over a deterministic approach with safety stocks amount to 3.02 % for the controlled test instances. In a similar comparison for the case study, average results over different parameter combinations show a 20.60 % logistics costs saving potential.}

At present, studies on sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) practices in the industry do not include firm-internal factors that affect the sustainability strategies employed by different functional areas of its supply chains. Our study aims to address this gap by identifying the relevant internal factors and exploring their relationship with SSCM strategies. Specifically, we discuss the commitment to and preparedness for sustainable practices of companies that operate in upstream and downstream O&G supply chain. We study the impact of these factors on their sustainability strategies of four key supply chain functions: supplier management, production management, product stewardship and logistics management. The analyses of data collected through a survey among 81 companies show that management preparedness may enhance sustainable supply chain strategies in the O&G industry more than commitment does. Among the preparedness measures, management of supply chain operational risks is found to be vital to the sustainability of all supply chain functions except for production management practices. The findings also highlight the central importance of supplier and logistics management to the achievement of sustainable O&G supply chains. Companies must also develop an organizational culture that encourages, for example, team collaboration and proactive behaviour to finding innovative sustainability solutions in order to translate commitment to sustainable practices into actions that can produce actual difference to their SSCM practices.}

In this paper, the applicability of control theory to engineering and management problems in supply chain operations is investigated. Our analysis bridges the fundamentals of control and systems theory to supply chain and operations management. This study extends our previous survey in the Annual Reviews in Control (Ivanov et al. 2012) by including new literature published in 2012–2018, identifying two new directions of control theory applications (i.e., ripple effect analysis in the supply chains and scheduling in Industry 4.0) and analysis towards the digital technology use in control theoretic models. It describes important issues and perspectives that delineate dynamics in supply chains, operations, and Industry 4.0 networks and identifies and systemizes different streams in the application of control theory to operations and supply chain management and engineering in the period from 1960–2018. It updates the existing applications and classifications, performs a critical analysis, and discusses further research avenues. Further development of interdisciplinary approaches to supply chain optimization is argued. An extended cooperation between control engineers and supply chain experts may have the potential to introduce more realism to dynamic planning and models, and improve performance in production and logistics systems, supply chains, and Industry 4.0 networks. Finally, we analyze the trends towards the intellectualization of control and its development towards supply chain control analytics.}

We extract the stopping points from the trajectory data sequence based on the duration of nonmovement, and construct business time window and electronic fence by analyzing the driving habits of vehicles. Furthermore, we propose a probabilistic logic based data segmentation method (PLDSM) which not only helps finding all the business points but also assists in inferring the business affair categories. An efficient numerical algorithm integrating duality theory and Newton's method is proposed to obtain the optimal solution. Finally, a practical example is presented to validate the effectiveness of PLDSM. The results greatly enrich the data segmentation technique and promote the practicability of probabilistic logic.}

abstract = {Objective
To evaluate the potential impact and value of applications (e.g. adjusting ordering levels, storage capacity, transportation capacity, distribution frequency) of data from demand forecasting systems implemented in a lower-income country's vaccine supply chain with different levels of population change to urban areas.
Materials and Methods
Using our software, HERMES, we generated a detailed discrete event simulation model of Niger's entire vaccine supply chain, including every refrigerator, freezer, transport, personnel, vaccine, cost, and location. We represented the introduction of a demand forecasting system to adjust vaccine ordering that could be implemented with increasing delivery frequencies and/or additions of cold chain equipment (storage and/or transportation) across the supply chain during varying degrees of population movement.
Results
Implementing demand forecasting system with increased storage and transport frequency increased the number of successfully administered vaccine doses and lowered the logistics cost per dose up to 34%. Implementing demand forecasting system without storage/transport increases actually decreased vaccine availability in certain circumstances.
Discussion
The potential maximum gains of a demand forecasting system may only be realized if the system is implemented to both augment the supply chain cold storage and transportation. Implementation may have some impact but, in certain circumstances, may hurt delivery. Therefore, implementation of demand forecasting systems with additional storage and transport may be the better approach. Significant decreases in the logistics cost per dose with more administered vaccines support investment in these forecasting systems.
Conclusion
Demand forecasting systems have the potential to greatly improve vaccine demand fulfilment, and decrease logistics cost/dose when implemented with storage and transportation increases. Simulation modeling can demonstrate the potential health and economic benefits of supply chain improvements.}

This cross-sectional study was undertaken at 136 outreach sessions across 27 districts in three states (Bihar-62, Gujarat-43 and Kerala-31). Data was collected on session organization, vaccine supply, handling, beneficiary interaction, documentation, and waste handling.
Results
All essential items and vaccines were available at 52.2% and 59.7% of sessions. The overall beneficiary turnout was 72.6%. Matching diluents were available for 94.4% of lyophilised vaccine vials. All four messages were given to 58.8% beneficiaries and 40% were advised to wait for 30 minutes. Few sites received vaccine vials with unusable vaccine vial monitors and frozen free-sensitive vaccine vials.
Conclusion
Program attention is needed to improve organisation, logistics and vaccine handling at the outreach sessions to ensure optimal service delivery and beneficiary experience. The supportive supervision and monitoring must be strengthened focusing on updated beneficiary list, vaccine handling, counselling and waste handling.}

Besides, according to the recent related papers, utilizing both heuristics and metaheuristics to solve the problem is an interesting topic in this research area. So, in this paper, to find the optimal for receiving and shipping trucks sequence, we employ five metaheuristics along with hybrid one. Furthermore, two heuristics are firstly developed in this research area which generate better solutions in comparison with the previous ones proposed in the literature. Besides, Taguchiapproach is employed to tune the parameters of algorithms. The results of the developed heuristics and metaheuristics are compared with each other and also with the results yielded by previous related works in terms of different criteria such as solution quality and computational run time. In addition, to probe the performance of the algorithms precisely, a new lower bound is developed.}

It can be modeled as a variant of the open vehicle routing problem (OVRP), where the vehicles do not return to the depot after servicing customers. However, very few papers have studied fuel consumption in the context of third party logistics. In this work, the mathematical model of the green open vehicle routing problem with time windows (GOVRPTW) was described based on the comprehensive modal emission model (CMEM). A hybrid tabu search algorithm involving several neighborhood search strategies was designed to solve this problem. Computational experiments were performed on realistic instances based on the real road conditions of Beijing, China. The effect of empty kilometers is analyzed through comparing different cost components. Compared with closed routes, the open routes reduced the total cost by 20% with both the fuel emissions costs and the CO2 emissions cost down by nearly 30%. For the experiments with congested nodes, the fuel and emissions cost rose by 12.3%, and the driver cost even increased by 31.3%.}

As a newly industrialized country, Turkey still achieves high growth rate and continuous development of global trade. As a result of high volume of trade, the role of ports raises its importance, and it attracts global investors in the port business. Turkey has focused on port devolution in the last two decades, and both domestic and global investors have been authorized to establish new port facilities as well as operating existing ports. Meanwhile, the national logistics industry has achieved a great leap which is also improved by the development of port business. Under various national and global circumstances, a synopsis of port governance in Turkey will be discussed from different perspectives including institutional changes and transport policy. This comparative case study particularly focusses on the last two decades in transition of public ports to various forms of private entities. The change of governance scheme is investigated through its impact on cargo traffic (especially containerized cargo) as well as logistics infrastructure in brief.}

Generally, the models that emission factors originate from are unknown. This makes their application difficult, especially when interdependencies between measures must be considered. Here, we develop a policy oriented framework of simplified emission factors that are derived from internally consistent, comprehensive models, are applicable to the various measures by different logistic actors and are as easy to use as the usual ton-kilometer indicator. We identify a set of emission factors by taking simple first order derivatives of two comprehensive models proposed in the literature, the EcoTransIT World Model and the Ligterink model. The approach allows us to compare the models and discuss the effectiveness of our framework for alternative mitigation strategies. We position the emission factors of the first as a specific case of the latter model and discuss the bounds of the applicability of emission factors from the two models.}

To solve this problem, it is suggested to apply the Voronoi model adapted for transportation network. The model is developed with the geometrical instrumentation applied to find the map of the shortest distances. The development includes the space being subdivided into clusters. Mathematical formulation а the cluster model can vary depending on the city size. The larger the city is, the bigger the number and sizes of the clusters are. Standard Voronoi model satisfies some properties that are given in this article. To solve this problem, a module of the MATLAB software suite was used, in particular, the algorithm of constructing of Voronoi polygons. The capabilities of the software allowed carrying out the cluster analysis, and, on the basis of the comparative analysis, calculating a number of values that reflect the spatial arrangement. To arrange the effective operation of the transportation corridors, a direct interaction with logistics centers is necessary. They ensure the prompt delivery of the freight in the quantity required, without creating any obstructions in the network. Moreover, it is necessary to take into consideration economic factors, in particular, the decrease of: the fuel consumption rate, the average distance run of the rolling stock, a number of loading and unloading stations for the service activities of certain zones. To provide a complex solution of the designated problem, it is necessary to create systems of prompt management of operation of freight transportation, systems of forwarding services and implementation of methods that are able to reduce the load of the street and road network by means of the expert distribution of the freight traffic flows, to ensure reduction of ecological pressure, to find the more economic transportation variants.}

abstract = {Realization of Millennium Development Goals should be also reflected in construction industry. Sustainable consumption and production patterns can be associated with implementing and developing reverse logistics system on construction site to close the supply chain of construction materials. Initiating activities are undertaken already at the construction site, conditioning thereby further possibilities of resource recovery, stages of the recovery process, and total costs. Hence, the type, quantity and the quality of waste affect the cost of its collection – which can be a significant item in a project's budget. The paper provides an overview of the existing national recovery systems and waste policies to provide background for the case study. A crucial part of the research is an analysis of three waste management scenarios for a particular construction project. “Anthropocentric”, “current” and “ecocentric” approaches were studied in terms of waste collection costs. Two extreme approaches were created as an alternative to usual waste management policy applied on construction site. The “antropocentric” approach is a reflection of ill-conceived waste management - assuming no segregation, which leads to high costs of waste processing. The “ecocentric” approach, in turn, assumes direct sales of sorted waste at lower prices, and also by reverse logistics within the project, thereby providing cost savings. The results show that policy of waste disposal encourages and even forces entrepreneurs to implement reverse logistics despite the additional duties and requirements. General conclusions of research confirm that currently operating systems of waste management on site are sustainable, but nevertheless, it is still possible to make them more eco-efficient and, at the same time, more profitable. This was proved in the analysis of the “Ecocentric” scenario, which could be also called as “Economic”.}

The capacity of all hubs and transportation modes is considered to be limited. Thus, this study aims to find the optimal location of hubs and other elements for making the network efficient.

abstract = {Increasing concerns on supply chain sustainability have given birth to the concept of closed-loop supply chain. Closed-loop supply chains include the return processes besides forward flows to recover the value from the customers or end-users. Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) systems ensure collaborative relationships between a vendor and a set of customers. In such systems, the vendor takes on the responsibility of product deliveries and inventory management at customers. Product deliveries also include reverse flows of returnable transport items. The execution of the VMI policy requires vendor to deal with a Closed-loop Inventory Routing Problem (CIRP) consisting of its own forward and backward routing decisions, and inventory decisions of customers. In CIRP literature, traditional assumptions of disregarding reverse logistic operations, knowing beforehand distribution costs between nodes and customers demand, and managing single product restrict the usage of the proposed models in current food logistics systems. From this point of view, the aim of this research is to enhance the traditional models for the CIRP to make them more useful for the decision makers in closed-loop supply chains. Therefore, we propose a probabilistic mixed-integer linear programming model for the CIRP that accounts for forward and reverse logistics operations, explicit fuel consumption, demand uncertainty and multiple products. A case study on the distribution operations of a soft drink company shows the applicability of the model to a real-life problem. The results suggest that the proposed model can achieve significant savings in total cost and thus offers better support to decision makers.}

abstract = {Anaerobic bio-digestion/energy generation (ABD/EG) complexes that use animal waste have become increasingly important as renewable energy sources and logistics considerations are essential as animal biomass is of costly transportation due to its high weight per unit of energy generated. To ensure overall economic viability it is necessary to take into account the supply chain network when designing such a complex for at least two main reasons. First, these complexes provide power from energy sources which otherwise would go to waste and a well-designed supply chain network will significantly lower long-term operating costs. Second, because they provide an outlet for farm manure (their feedstock), these complexes allow farmers to expand production capacity whenever environmentally sound animal waste disposal is an active constraint to operations. This paper presents a methodology to design a supply chain which maximizes contribution and minimizes gas loss in the commonly found configuration in which feedstock providers are numerous small farms without on-site bio-digestion units, i.e., a configuration in which in-natura biomass is transported from those small farms to supply a nearby ABD/EG complex serving the region. The paper details three layers of analysis for designing optimal animal waste supply for anaerobic bio-digestion, including model formulation and mathematical solution for each stage. The broadest layer in the methodology is the identification of the optimal ABD/EG complex positioning given farm locations and consequent biomass transportation costs. The middle layer is the specification of the optimal logistics and transportation system, including the prioritization of supplying farms. The operational layer includes scheduling optimal biomass collection from each farm to minimize biogas loss.}

This study reports knowledge of onchocerciasis and surrounding factors from the perspective of community members, Community drug distributors and health workers in eight endemic LGAs of Ogun State, Nigeria.
Methods
Using structured questionnaires and Focus Group Discussion, a total of 417 community members, 37 health workers and 42 CDDs across 16 communities participated in the study.
Results
Majority (70.7%) of participants knew the disease by its local name, “Inarun”. Community members (62%) identified severe itching as a symptom of the disease while (35.9%) (17.6%) and (9.8%) of participants associated bites of black-flies, physical-exertion on farm and allergies to peanuts as the cause of the disease. Majority (62.2%) of health workers reported the insufficiency of drug-storage facilities at community-health centres. Drug distributors also decried the paucity of funds to facilitate wide therapeutic-coverage. Compliance with drug use was affected by adverse reaction by (4%) Community members, pregnancy (9%) and inability to swallow pills (11.6%).
Conclusion
To improve onchocerciasis control in Ogun State, public-health-education regarding the disease aetiology needs to be improved. Also, treatment rounds need to be increased to accommodate members who unwillingly missed treatment. Finally, government provision of transport logistics to CDDs for ease of logistics is very important.}

Taking an historical perspective, the paper argues that shipping is fundamentally a derived demand arising out of, but also enabling, the spatial separation of production and consumption that are integrated through global value chains. It is argued that the twin processes of innovation-enabled specialisation (into e.g. container ships; bulk carriers etc.) and increased scale both of ships and of shipping operations have embedded shipping into logistics systems of increasing complexity and reach. The objective of the paper is to demonstrate, using secondary data, the long-run trends in the growth of shipping carbon emissions for bulkers and tankers, as well as the impact of increased scale and vessel speed on such emissions. A fuel-based, top-down, methodology, based on fuel consumption estimates derived from secondary source industry data that are suitable for a macro-level analysis, is used to estimate global shipping carbon emissions. It is argued that technologies or operational innovations that reduce the environmental burdens of shipping, while useful, do not represent the socio-technical system ‘regime’ shift that international maritime logistics requires in order to contribute to improved sustainability. Rather, in the relative absence of strong governance mechanisms in the maritime field, it is underlying ‘landscape’ shifts in production and consumption that are likely to act to reduce the demand for shipping and hence to be more significant in the longer run.}

Warehousing is a crucial industry for trade-dependent nations like Malaysia. According to the World Bank Logistic Performance Index (LPI) 2016, Malaysia was ranked number 32 out of 160 countries in 2016, as against number 25 in 2014, despite a high level of warehouse activity during that year. The decrease in ranking was due to low warehouse productivity in Malaysia. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to consider ten parameters to assess the failure factors of warehouse productivity in the Malaysian logistics service sector, by applying a fuzzy analytic hierarchy process method. The findings highlighted the top three failure factors that influence the levels of warehouse productivity in the Malaysian logistics service sector as being ‘labour productivity’, ‘warehouse utilisation’ and ‘inventory space utilisation’. This study contributes to the empowerment of warehouse productivity in the industry, in alignment with Malaysia's aspirational 2020 economic target. Consequently, this study provides new knowledge on warehouse productivity issues that will benefit decision makers in the warehouse industry. This research may enable decision makers to recognise problematic factors when planning their warehouse productivity improvement strategy, which may contribute to fulfilling government targets and empowering the national economy.}

abstract = {Transshipment hub selection becomes increasingly important to the global logistics community. From the perspectives of shippers and freight forwarders, a selection must align with cost control strategy and sustain service reliability across cooperative service providers. This paper assesses the selection with the options of both sea and air transports, and from the influence of country of origin of the company. Critical factors of transshipment hub selection, both qualitative and quantitative, are identified through focus group discussions. Relative importance of these factors is determined based on collective views of logistics stakeholders. The competitiveness of transshipment hubs is then assessed using an AHP approach. Our analysis is based on the historical implementation of direct transportation link policy between Mainland China and Taiwan. With this empirical work, the finding suggests that even the spawn of other nearby ports with shorter transport distance and closer proximity to cargo sources, there remain overriding factors such as customs regulations & government policies and connectivity that a transshipment hub is preferred.}

Automatic identification (ID) of goods is widely used in industry, logistics, medicine and other fields. The aim is to obtain the ID information of a good in transit. Giant electronic commerce platforms such as Amazon, Alibaba or eBay are becoming the main choice for buyers worldwide. Instead of buying from a small retailer, final customers are directly in contact with a wholesaler or distributor. In this context, accurate tracking of each good to its final customer is a major concern in a massive and growing logistics market. An efficient, automatic organization of the stock in large warehouses (both sellers’ and logistics companies’) is also crucial to reduce costs and delivery times.}

abstract = {Emerging project management methods for construction projects create new kinds of challenges for the delivery process of materials. The main motive behind introducing such methods is to create short-term schedules, based on a constraint analysis of resources. This approach has two requirements for material deliveries: transparency of material availability and short response times in the supply chain. We propose a potential solution for managing the material logistics of construction projects. The empirically validated solution proposes a shipment tracking-based approach to provide inventory transparency, and a pro-active delivery approach for efficient material deliveries.}

abstract = {The Dynamic Facility Layout Problem (DFLP) is designing a facility over a multi-period planning horizon where the interdepartmental material flows change from one period to the next one due to changes in product demands. The DFLP is used while designing manufacturing and logistics facilities over multiple planning periods; however, it is a very challenging nonlinear optimization problem. In this paper, a zone-based block layout is used to design manufacturing and logistics facilities over multiple planning periods. A zone-based block layout inherently includes possible aisle structures, which can easily be adapted to different material handling systems. The unequal area DFLP is modeled and solved using a zone-based structure where the dimensions of the departments are decision variables, and the departments are assigned to flexible zones with a pre-structured positioning. A matheuristic approach, which combines concepts from Tabu Search (TS) and mathematical programming, is proposed to solve the zone-based DFLP on the continuous plane with unequal area departments. The TS determines the relative locations of departments and their assignments to zones while their exact locations and shapes are calculated by the mathematical programming. Numerical results for a set of test problems from the literature showed that our proposed matheuristic approach is promising.}

abstract = {Smart factory, as one of key future for our industry, requires logistics automation within a manufacturing site such as a shop floor. Automated guided vehicle (AGV) systems may be one solution, whose accuracy will be influenced by some factors. This paper presents a radio frequency identification (RFID)-enabled positioning system in AGV for smart factory. Key impact factors on AGV's accuracy such as magnetic field in circular antenna, circular magnetic field, and circular contours stability are examined quantitatively. Based on the examinations, simulation studies and a testbed are carried out to evaluate the feasibility and practicality of the proposed approach. It is observed that large diameter antennas are used in driving zone and small diameter antennas are used in parking zone. This approach was compared with another method using passive RFID tags and it is superior to that method with greatly reduced tags’ deployment. Observations and lessons from simulation and testbed studies could be used for guiding automatic logistics within a smart manufacturing shop floor.}
