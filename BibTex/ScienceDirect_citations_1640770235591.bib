abstract = {This paper argues both small and large firms use different resource allocation patterns to benefit from implementing environmental management practices (EMPs) and environmental management systems (EMS). Results from the multi-group structural equation analyses of a survey of manufacturing firms in two countries support the resource allocation arguments - large firms use resource-demanding EMPs such as green product design and green production to improve outcomes in environmental, cost-reduction and business performance, while small firms choose resource-light EMPs such as green logistics and green packaging to gain only environmental and cost-reduction benefits. The paper advances the existing resource-advantage view by revealing different resource allocation patterns and provides meaningful recommendations through which policy makers can address various resource allocation constraints among small and large enterprises.}

We demonstrate that container shipping lines have developed a very strong focus on market shares and on the lowering of the cost base by ordering ultra large vessels and by focusing on horizontal integration. The increasing “commoditization” of the liner shipping market and low margins are urging shipping lines to consider other growth strategies and revenue models by focusing on supply chain integration/vertical integration, digital transformation and by aiming for zero emission ships. These transformation processes within container shipping lines are not easy, given the weak financial base of most companies.}

abstract = {Introduction
Perioperative transfusion is associated with reduced with reduced survival1 and increased morbidity and mortality2 Several studies report poor adoption of guidelines and wide variation in clinical practice3. However, the influence of simple practical factors is disregarded, as for instance which blood products are available in which time for the transfusing physician? We hypothesize that local practical issues are a relevant cofounder of transfusion decisions.
Methods
With kind endorsement of EACTAIC, the link to a web-based survey was sent via newsletter to all EACTAIC-Members via the monthly newsletter in November 2020.
Results
The Newsletter was opened by 429 active members. We collected 66 survey responses, with 51 complete surveys, resulting in a response rate of 11.9% 72% of participants report having a local algorithm for the use of blood products and coagulation factors. Several factors were reported as having an influence on the local transfusion algorithm (Figure 1) and on transfusion practice (Figure 2).  86% of respondents report ROTEM®/TEG® available, 76% haemoglobin tests, 24% quick measurements and 22% Thrombocyte function tests. 6% of the respondents have no point of care test available. A majority of respondents report the possibility to receive more than 10 labile blood products delivered at once (64%). Packed red blood cells are available with a median time delay of 10-15 minutes (Figure 3). For platelets, a median time between ordering and delivery of 15-20 minutes was reported (Figure 4).
Discussion
The data of our survey reveals wide variability in the logistics of perioperative transfusion and significant subjective influence of these logistic factors. The time to delivery of labile blood products was the most mentioned factor. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate logistic factors with influence on transfusion practice. The principal limitation of our survey is the low response rate. In many situations, the transfusing physician has the consequences of a delayed or omitted transfusion directly in sight, while the consequences of unnecessary transfusions remain diffuse. Those subjective benefits of transfusion might lead to a risk-aversive behavior, as is known from economy and sociology 4. In combination with (perceived) long delivery times, this might be a contributing factor for transfusion incidence. The adaption of institutional processes therefore bear potential benefits for better adherence to transfusion guidelines. In conclusion, transfusion logistics show wide variation across different institutions and are a significant subjective contributor to the individual transfusion behaviour.}

In this paper, we have proposed a nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) based approach with objective-specific variation operators to address the MOVRPTW. In the proposed NSGA-II approach, the crossover and mutation operators are designed by exploiting the problem characteristics as well as the attributes of each objective.

Our objective in doing so is to highlight conditions which cause such attack to facilitate the development of protection mechanisms for them.

The local and global features are utilized respectively. The spatial attention maps are embedded into the original convolutional neural network to emphasize the interested local features and weaken the influence of other objects and background. The channel weight maps are introduced into the feature pyramid network of detection network to weight the multi-scale feature maps in channels. The representative global features are focused and unnecessary features are suppressed. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method has increased fault diagnosis accuracy for faulted current-carrying rings compared with the original detection network based on different backbones.

However, travel ban could significantly impact many industries, e.g. tourism and logistics, thus jeopardizing the regional economy. This paper focus on assisting the national or regional government to make dynamic decisions on restricting and recovering intercity multi-modal travel services. Our model can characterize impacts of inter-city traffic on the spread of the COVID-19, as well as on the regional economy. By applying a reinforcement learning approach, we develop an online optimization model to identify the modal-specific travel banning strategy that can balance the epidemic control as well as the negative impacts on regional economy.

Open and closed hydraulic systems are compared from different aspects; these are operability and response time, reliability, logistics and installation and environmental issues. Closed loop is the proposed hydraulic circulation system since it has much less emission to the sea compared to open loop. However, closed loop is more costly and it has impact on the actuator design and qualification program. The effect of closed loop on actuator design is also explained in this chapter.}

In this work, we extend the two-dimensional vector packing problem by considering a more realistic cost structure, which is a general function of volumetric weight. The problem is to pack a set of different items into some identical bins without violating weight limits and volume capacities so that the total delivery cost is minimized. We develop an exact approach based on a branch-and-price algorithm and subset-row inequalities for the problem. To efficiently solve the pricing problem in column generation, a label-setting algorithm with an effective label dominance rule and a bounding procedure is presented. A stronger label dominance rule is derived for the case where the cost function is convex. The computational results show that the exact method is effective in solving the various test instances of the problem. If the volumetric weight is not considered, the exact method can be adapted to solve the two-dimensional vector packing problem with piecewise linear cost function and outperformed the existing exact algorithm by computing 27 optimal solutions for previously open instances.}

abstract = {The search for sustainability has pointed to the need to transition from a linear to a circular model. However, such a transition is not trivial. Modifying production chains with the focus on reducing virgin raw materials consumption, cut emissions, and prevent waste generation implies implementing new processes and services, which can add considerable environmental impacts to the supply chain. This paper analyzes a real case from a production system aligned with circular economy principles. The production system consists of the manufacturing of baseboards made of recycled Expanded Polystyrene (EPS), obtained from an extensive reverse logistics system composed of different recycling processes. The system's potential environmental impacts were assessed by two widely used methodologies, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Emergy Analysis (EMA). For comparison purposes, the analysis was carried out for a fictional linear production system, in which the baseboard would be made of virgin EPS. EMA attributed a lower emergy load to the circular scenario compared to the linear scenario (8.62E+15 seJ to recycled EPS versus 1.26E+16 seJ to virgin EPS). LCA results indicate both scenarios as environmental preferable depending on the impact category under analysis (e.g. circular system has better performance regarding global warming, while the linear scenario demonstrated better results under water consumption). For the circular scenario, EMA identified the main impact drivers, such as transportation and electricity consumption. From LCA perspective impacts are also driven by electricity consumption. However, differently from EMA, logistics were only significant for Land Use impact category whereas Liquefied Petroleum Gas consumption and, landfill air emissions were identified as impact hotspots. These convergences and differences between the findings of LCA and EMA have demonstrated potentially complementation to broaden available information related to systems, enabling decision makers to act effectively in improving the environmental performance of their production processes, especially when implementing circular practices.}

abstract = {Several studies focused on harbour impact on air quality of port-cities showing that maritime emissions could be comparable to traffic emissions of a medium-size town having relevant impact on air quality nearby the harbours. In order to plan efficient mitigation strategies, environmental and port authorities have an increasing need of reliable tools for investigating the impact of ships traffic and harbour logistics on atmospheric pollutants. In this work a system based on the integration of measurements collected using a network of low-cost on-line sensors with local scale dispersion modelling was developed. It was implemented, as a pilot action, in the information and management software of the Bari harbour (SE Italy). It can operate in near-real-time, in forecast mode, and on archived data for long-term assessments. It was tested studying the impact of the Bari harbour for the year 2018. The lowest impact was observed for CO, being the pollutant with the lowest share of the contribution of ships (between 8% and 68%) compared with the total harbour contribution. The impacts on PM2.5 and PM10 are larger arriving up to 11.8% of concentrations in the harbour area with an influence of shipping between 44% and 97%. The impact on SO2 is almost solely due to ships and it arrives up to 80% in the harbour area. The impact on NOX ranges from a few percent in the urban area up to 40% in the harbour area and it is the pollutant of major concern regarding compliance with air quality standards.}

abstract = {In 2018, safety culture assessments were carried out in the Rotterdam region in nineteen major hazard companies. Four industrial sectors were involved: refineries, (petro) chemical industry, bulk storage, and chemical warehousing and logistics. Fourteen companies had participated in a similar evaluation in 2012. The assessment methodology developed in 2012 was both pragmatic (with a focus on fourteen dimensions) and normative (using a scale of 1–5 for safety culture maturity). A score of 3.0 was regarded as the minimum acceptable score for major hazards companies. The safety culture maturity scores compiled in this study allowed benchmarking of the safety cultures among the companies and sectors. The refineries had the highest ratings. In two chemical warehousing and logistics companies the safety culture maturity was below acceptable. Strengths and weaknesses of safety culture were identified at company and sector levels, and each company recognized and acknowledged the outcomes. The consistency in safety culture levels was shown to be an important factor, inconsistency blurring the borders between predefined levels of safety culture. The study is the first to present results of repeated safety culture maturity assessments. Comparing the 2012 and 2018 results in fourteen companies showed that consistently good or excellent scores in 2012 were a good predictor for an adequate safety culture six years later. The results showed that it is possible to improve the safety culture in six years from below acceptable (2.5) to good (4.0). However, no evidence was found for the ‘maturing process’ suggested in the theory. The interventions that were likely to have contributed to improvements in safety culture were education and training, launching a safety culture improvement program, realizing concrete safety improvements, and strengthening the involvement of the personnel.}

abstract = {Introduction
Hemorrhage is a leading cause of death among trauma patients, and is the most common cause of preventable death after trauma. Since the advent of blood component fractioning, most patients receive blood components rather than whole blood (WB). WB contains all of the individual blood components and has the advantages of simplifying resuscitation logistics, providing physiological ratios of components, reducing preservative volumes and allowing transfusion of younger red blood cells (RBC). Successful experience with fresh whole blood (FWB) by the US military is well documented. In the civilian setting, transfusion of cold-stored low titer type O whole blood (LTOWB) was shown to be safe. Reports of WB are limited by small numbers and low transfusion volumes.
Study design
We conducted a systematic review of the available published studies, comparing efficacy and safety of resuscitation with WB to resuscitation with blood components, in hemorrhaging trauma patients, using MEDLINE, EMBASE and ISI Web of Science. The main outcomes of interest were 24 hour and 30-day survival, blood product utilization and adverse events. Two reviewers independently abstracted the studies and assessed for bias. Sub-group analyses were pre-planned on the FWB and LTOWB groups separately.
Results
Out of 126 references identified through our search strategy, five studies met the inclusion criteria. Only one study of FWB showed a significant benefit on 24 hour and 30-day survival. Other studies of both FWB and LTOWB showed no statistically significant difference in survival. There is an apparent benefit in blood product utilization with the use of WB across most studies. There were no reports of transfusion related reactions, however there was an increase in the organ failure rates in the FWB groups.
Conclusions
WB was not associated with a significant survival benefit or reduced blood product utilization. Nonetheless, it seems that the use of LTOWB is safe and might carry a significant logistic benefit. The quality of the existing data is poor and further high quality studies are required.}

This research conducts a case study of Hong Kong with the aim of unraveling the causes of ineffective construction waste management from a logistics perspective and developing strategies to improve efficiency of waste collection and transportation. We analyze 112,892 individual trips undertaken by 2,563 construction waste hauling trucks and find three critical issues, namely irrational facility choice, disorganized trip chains, and serious underloading. We design an order-to-order distance matrix, based on which we develop a combinatorial approach to optimizing construction waste collection and transportation through (1) optimal facility choice, (2) proper order sequencing, and (3) increased loading ratio. Simulation results indicate that optimal facility choice is most effective of the three strategies, reducing travel distance by 15.2% (15,256 km) and saving 15.3% (21,467 kg) in CO2-eq emissions. Combining the three strategies creates the best optimization effects, saving 20.3% of travel distance (20,346 km) and 18.2% of CO2-eq emissions (25,544 kg). Our findings provide valuable insights for construction waste management and suggest strategies (e.g., developing a work dispatch system like Uber or proper vehicle routing algorithms) for improving waste collection efficiency and reducing carbon emissions.}

Because the crowdsourced delivery offers greater flexibility and requires less capital investment than traditional delivery methods, it has been playing a more crucial role when faced with the growing demand for the urban parcel delivery. With the increasing maturity of the crowdsourced delivery and the fierce competition among platforms, the evaluation of different crowdsourcing modes for the urban parcel delivery becomes important. This study proposes six mathematical models to evaluate different operation modes of the crowdsourced delivery in a quantitative way. Several realistic factors, such as the latest service time for each task, task cancellation rate and range distribution of tasks, are also analyzed in this paper. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed models and to analyze the impact of different modes. Some managerial implications are also outlined on the basis of the numerical experiments and sensitivity analysis to help crowdsourced companies to make scientific decisions.}

abstract = {By conducting a cross-sectional survey at Deutsche Post, a major German postal delivery service provider, we examine to what extent commercial drivers accept the substitution of conventional cars with light-duty e-vehicles (LDEVs). Specifically, we explore drivers’ acceptance from two perspectives. First, we investigate drivers’ perceived satisfaction with LDEVs compared to conventional vehicles. Second, we question whether electric cars in general increase drivers’ perceived efficiency of them. Combining these two perspectives, we show that the greater the drivers’ overall perceived satisfaction with LDEVs is, the higher is the drivers’ perceived efficiency of LDEVs. We prove this by means of perceived usefulness (perceived relative advantage) and perceived ease of use (the opposite of perceived complexity) of LDEVs, using adaptations of Davis’ Technology Acceptance Model and Rogers’ Diffusion of Innovations Theory to form our Unified Technology Acceptance Model (UTAM). Our findings suggest that, on average, drivers are slightly more satisfied with the LDEVs than with the available conventional cars (n = 66). If drivers were able to choose their preferred vehicles, the majority of them would favor LDEVs. We detect statistically significant patterns of latent measures affecting perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of LDEVs. Although this paper focuses on German delivery service employees, the methodology presented here could easily be applied to any other enterprise in the growing logistics segment which plans to electrify its car fleet. Hence, our contributions are valuable for transportation research and, more specifically, to all potential commercial EV drivers, e.g., our insights might be relevant for the approx. 500,400 drivers employed in the German logistics sector alone.}

To examine whether or not the detection rate of CIS was significantly higher after switching from PDD guided TURBT to NBI guided TURBT.
Materials and Methods
Pathological outcome regarding CIS detection was reviewed in all TURBT procedures in a 2 year period. A total number of 1,132 TURBT procedures were reviewed. In period 1, starting from January 2018 to December 2018, 487 TURBTs were performed and in period 2, from January 2019 to December 2019, 645 TURBTs were performed. PDD was used as assistance to detect CIS in period 1 and NBI was introduced as assistance instead of PDD in all TURBT in period 2.
Results
A significantly higher detection rate of CIS was found in period 2 compared to period 1 (8.7% versus 4.9%, p=0.02). In primary tumours, CIS was detected in 8.4% in period 2 versus 5.4% in period 1 (not significant) whereas in TURBs for recurrent tumour, CIS was detected in 8.6% in period 2 versus 4.6% in period 1 (p=0.04). There was no difference in CIS detection in patients investigated following BCG treatment for CIS (18,1% vs 21,4%).
Conclusion
The overall detecting of CIS is significantly higher in period 2 but not not in the recurrent tumour group, neither in the control after BCG group. These data suggest that PDD is not superior to NBI. The reduced cost and the convenient logistics of NBI can most likely improve the overall CIS detection rate.}

For this purpose, the impacts for each stakeholder were identified, their monetization was incorporated in the analysis and the results were discussed in light of the Kaldor-Hicks criterion. Two Brazilian cases are used to apply the proposed methodology. The results show that when socio-environmental impacts, such as a reduction in traffic congestion and pollution emissions, are incorporated into the economic evaluation, implementation is justified for cities with high levels of traffic congestion. This study might improve the future analysis of urban consolidation center projects by performing a more comprehensive economic evaluation.

Oxytocin (10 IU, 16.8 μg) coated onto stainless steel MN arrays was released into skin within 1–5 min after manual insertion. Among tested excipients, polyacrylic acid was best at stabilizing oxytocin stored at 75% relative humidity, with no significant loss for up to 2 months at 40 °C. Under desiccated conditions, MNs coated with formulations containing trehalose in a mixture of citrate buffer and ethanol retained 75% oxytocin potency at 40 °C for 12 months; the commercial oxytocin product Pitocin® was reduced to 35% potency under these conditions. These findings support development of MN patches for oxytocin administration with improved ease of use, extended thermostability and simplified logistics to enable greater access to this life-saving medicine.}

abstract = {Railway management deals with the most efficient organization of all components of the railway system, so as to achieve the best result, that is, the higher level of traffic and revenues with the lowest possible costs. As railways are a heavy and rigid industry, railway management should begin from a good understanding of the internal and external environment of railways, the conditions of the market and a reorientation from engineering to customer satisfaction. A critical decision is whether to keep railway unified or separate it to infrastructure and operation and decide the level of charges that operators must pay for the use of infrastructure. Understanding and control of costs, increase of yields and revenues, optimal allocation of resources, and higher rates of productivity are principal tasks for an efficient management, which should monitor continuously passengers’ exigencies through market surveys. Railway management can be based on some form of business or master plan and for big projects can employ the services of project management. A dilemma toward optimization of finances is whether to aim at increase of traffic or profit, while providing advantages to frequent travelers or to targeted segments of the market. Another condition of success is incorporation of rail freight within the logistics chain.}

Especially omnidirectional mobile robots are interesting due to their flexibility as they are able to move in any direction regardless of their orientation. In this context, we developed a robot platform for research on said types of robot. It turns out that this robot shows interesting behavior, which simple first principle models commonly used in the field fail to reproduce. Additionally, different robots of the same platform show different behavior although they should be identical, necessitating adaptive modeling techniques. As the sources of the mismatches are unknown, we opt for nonparametric Gaussian process regression to train a model of our robots based on carefully selected input-output data, which shows promising results. With an accurate prediction of the robot’s future position and orientation, it is possible to plan the trajectory of the robot several time steps ahead allowing for a good open-loop performance. This can be useful, e.g., if in industrial applications not the entire warehouse is covered with optical position feedback. We then proceed to develop an optimization-based ancillary controller, that drives the initially unknown system dynamics to the nominal one.}

This study focuses on the waste value chain optimisation to recover value added products from OFMSW. Our research presents a systems modelling approach, which integrates spatial data analyses, mixed integer linear programming (MILP) optimisation and technology performance evaluation to inform the waste-to-resource value chain design. Variation in OFMSW quantity and composition across the UK and over 600 existing anaerobic digestion (AD) operational plants in the UK have been accounted for in the model. Based on the 2018 UK land cover map, potential sites for new waste-recovery facilities have been identified and the transportation and logistics were modelled based on the network analyses of existing UK road transport infrastructures. Furthermore, OFMSW generation scenarios were constructed, where the probability was estimated based on OFMSW correlation with environmental variables. The optimisation problems were solved to provide insights into the economically optimal design of OFMSW-recovery value chains, which highlight the spatially-explicit solutions on technology choice, sizing, location, and logistics of AD and thermochemical treatment facilities.}

This study proposes a new hybrid time-dependent Dijkstra’s and minimum vertex degree algorithm on a spherical bipolar fuzzy weighted graph to find shortest travel time of Hamiltonian cycles on transportation problems. To weight the transportation points in uncertain environment, decision makers can express their views with spherical bipolar fuzzy information based on the criteria. In the proposed methodology, for a given digraph, the nodes are weighted by the decision makers’ spherical bipolar fuzzy evaluations, and fuzzy Hamiltonian paths are determined using the minimum vertex degree method. The fuzzy Hamiltonian cycles constitute the routes for transportation network, and the starting point, which gives the shortest travel time, is investigated by time-dependent Dijkstra’s algorithm. This approach is an alternative way to solve the traveling salesman problem (TSP) in time-dependent graphs with Θ(VN2) time complexity. The proposed methodology is illustrated on a logistic network. It is intended to guide future graph-transportation research.}

However, the protection of the environment is one of the main factors that should be considered based on environmental protection regulations of countries. In this paper, environmental concerns are considered in formulating a mathematical model to design and configure a multi-period, multi-product, multi-echelon green meat supply chain network. We develop a multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming formulation to optimize three objectives simultaneously: minimization of the total cost, minimization of the total CO2 emissions released from transportation, and maximization of the total capacity utilization of facilities. To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed optimization model, we design a green meat supply chain network for Southern Ontario, Canada. A solution approach based on augmented ε-constraint method is employed to solve the proposed model. As a result, a set of Pareto-optimal solutions is obtained. The set of Pareto-optimal solutions gives decision-makers the opportunity to make a trade-off between economic, environmental, and capacity utilization objectives. Our example shows that it is possible to keep emissions reasonably low without incurring high total costs. Finally, the impacts of uncertainty on the proposed model are investigated using several decision trees. Optimization of a food supply chain, particularly a meat supply chain, based on multiple objectives under uncertainty using decision trees is a new approach in the literature.}

Motivated by the challenge that this NP-hard problem represents, it has captured the attention of the optimization community for decades. As a result, a large number of algorithms have been proposed to tackle this problem. Among these, exact methods are only able to solve instances of size n < 40. To overcome this limitation, many metaheuristic methods have been applied to the QAP. In this work, we follow this direction by approaching the QAP through Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs). Particularly, a non-parametric distance-based exponential probabilistic model is used. Based on the analysis of the characteristics of the QAP, and previous work in the area, we introduce Kernels of Mallows Model under the Hamming distance to the context of EDAs. Conducted experiments point out that the performance of the proposed algorithm in the QAP is superior to (i) the classical EDAs adapted to deal with the QAP, and also (ii) to the specific EDAs proposed in the literature to deal with permutation problems.}

abstract = {With the rapid development of e-commerce and the new retail, the same-day or even same-half day delivery service is provided to compete for market share. Recently, an increased number of e-commerce companies implement the unmanned smart warehouses to improve the logistics efficiency. In order to further reduce the demand response time, a novel picking strategy is designed to firstly split the orders, and then assign the partial orders to different pickers. After all the order segments have been collected, it is shipped to the customer. Due to the inherent complexity of the problem, a two stage optimization model is introduced. In the first stage, an order splitting and batching strategy based on spatial measure is proposed. And a MIP model is constructed to minimize the total picking distance, which is then solved via a column generation based algorithm. In the second stage, the newly formed batches are considered as a priori inputs, which are then assigned to automatic pickers. The picking process is modeled as a special parallel machine scheduling problem with multiple due dates for a single item, which could reduce to a customer order scheduling problem on parallel machines, and it is unary NP-complete. A heuristic method is proposed to obtain an approximate solution. Although the order splitting technique is not new in the logistics industry, the split orders are picked according to a vehicle routing problem, which fails to address the kitting issue for fast turnovers. In the numerical analysis section, the proposed algorithm is validated through extensive testing on various scales of instances. It is observed that the optimality gap for our algorithm is within 9%, and the computation time is around 5 min. Also, the average turnover rate increases by approximately 50% in comparison with the no-splitting policy. In most cases, the average order tardiness decreases by 90% compared with order splitting and no-kitting policy.}

The first stage generates tractor schedules to maximize profit, and the second stage aims to ensure sufficient trailers at each trailer depot during the container drayage operation.

This category of waste, in contrast to products that are removed based on reaching their best before or use-by date, are also having little potential for redistribtion, and may thus be most targeted in future waste reduction legislative initiatives. We develop some relatively easy to calculate measures to help a retailer with identifying the financial implications of waste production in relation to some supply source characteristics, the financial motivation of its supplier to tackle item deterioration at the retailer level, and how this is affected by the level of logistics collaboration. We also discuss how the model can help in deriving the relative benefit of technological, logistical, supplier selection, and marketing strategies available to the retailer to meet future legislative waste reduction targets, and derive conclusions with respect to the design of legislative instruments.}

This article presents a novel method on the assessment and modeling of sustainability impacts of food consumption. First, sustainability impacts of food consumption categories are quantified using high sector resolution input-output tables of U.S. economy. Later, an integrated sustainability modeling framework based on two supervised machine-learning techniques such as k-means clustering and logistics regression is presented. The proposed framework involves five steps: (1) economic input-output life cycle sustainability assessment, (2) non-dimensional normalization, (3) sustainability performance evaluation, (4) centroid-based clustering analysis, and (5) sustainability impact modeling. The findings show that the supply chains of food production sectors are accounted for major environmental impacts with higher than 80% of portions for total carbon footprints. Animal slaughtering, rendering, and processing is found as the most dominant sector in most of the environmental impact categories. The logistic model results revealed an overall model accuracy equal to 91.67%. Furthermore, among all the environmental sustainability indicators, it has found that CO and SO2 are the most significant contributors. The results also show that 13.7% of the food and beverage sectors are clustered as high, in which the bread and bakery product manufacturing is the central sector. The large value of the variance (5.24) is attributed to the large total weighted impact value of the animal (except poultry) slaughtering, rendering, and processing cluster.}

abstract = {Manufacturing systems (MSs) have become more and more complex, due to global competition. Optimal spare parts provisioning plays a critical role in sustaining an anticipated operational competitiveness level, via efficient and effective maintenance of machinery. The forecasting of intermittent demand for spare parts is a challenge, as it is not always possible to avoid random unforeseen breakdowns, which reduce availability and increase the unreliability of manufacturing systems. The aforementioned requires a systemic perspective, in order to perform a criticality analysis and prioritization of the spare parts needed to increase a manufacturing system’s availability and reliability. This paper first demonstrates the development of an empirical model (EM), using a case study MS. The EM enables a criticality analysis to be performed, considering the system perspective of spare part management, by taking maintenance-related and logistics-related factors into account. After that, the machineries are categorized into groups, considering the factors related to the maintenance, logistics and criticality levels. The second part presents how to perform spare part prioritization within a selected group, via an analytic hierarchy process (AHP), to minimize ad hoc suboptimal assessments, together with sensitivity analyses. Finally, it presents the spare part prioritization and the subsequent sensitivity analysis results.}

This study analyzes occupational incidents and musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) caused by MMH in the MVPM industry. Also, this study conducted a risk assessment for predicting the possibility and severity of the injuries and MSDs. This study examined 236 injured persons registered for occupational incidents and MSDs caused by MMH tasks. Of the 236 injuries, 124 (52.5%) were caused by lifting/lowering, followed by 92 (39.0%) pushing/pulling and 20 (8.5%) carrying. MSDs were the highest at 36.9%, followed by struck by (22.9%), caught in (19.5%), and slip/fall (9.7%) incidents. In the case of incidents, the percentage caused by pushing/pulling was the highest at 55.7%, followed by lifting/lowering (35.6%) and carrying (8.7%). However, in the case of MSDs, the percentage caused by lifting/lowering was the highest at 81.6%, followed by pushing/pulling (10.3%) and carrying (8.0%). However, the rate of severe injured with over 180 work-loss days was higher in carrying works, women, or older workers over 50 years. The highest prevalence of MSDs was low back (63.2%), followed by shoulders (17.2%), and arm/hand regions (16.1%). In risk assessment according to the work process, ‘struck by incidents during pushing/pulling carts in the logistics process’ is the most possible and the highest average of work-loss days.
Relevance to industry
This study presents the overview of actual nationwide compensation records occurred during MMH tasks in the MVPM industry. Also, this study shows the outlines of occupational incidents and MSDs, and the most possible and severe incident according to the types of MMH and work process.}

Transportation of biomass focuses on how and when to get raw materials, intermediate products, and finished goods from their respective origins to their destinations. Each supplier can implement strategic and tactical decisions to reduce costs and improve local and export customer service levels in a responsive, economic, and sustainable transportation network. In the process of quantifying economic and environmental sustainability, it is necessary to take into account the greenhouse gas emissions and cost resulting from the transportation of the biomass. This study focuses on the techno-economic and environmental assessment of BSC by considering three transportation modes that include truck, train, and barge. For this purpose, a simulation model is developed using AnyLogic software and tested on a case study in Malaysia. Results show that each type of transportation plays a vital role in designing a BSC transportation network to decrease the cost and GHG emissions. The results of this work would help the biomass industry stockholders and suppliers to define long, and short-term horizons to achieve a timely, cost-effective, and sustainable BSC transportation network.}

Thus, bioremediation techniques attract attention owing to their low impact on the environment. Among petroleum-based compounds, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are known for their potential impact and persistence in the environment. Therefore, PAH bioremediation is notably a technique capable of reducing these polluting compounds in the environment. However, there is a lack of understanding of microbial growth process conditions, leading to a less efficient choice of bioremediation methods. This article provides a review of the bioremediation processes in mangroves contaminated with oils and PAHs and an overview of some physicochemical and biological factors. Special attention was given to the lack of approach regarding experiments that have been conducted in situ and that considered the predominance of the anaerobic condition of mangroves.}

abstract = {The fast depletion of fossil fuels and adverse environmental impact from combustion have triggered an urgent need for new, cleaner and sustainable energy resources. In the last few decades, biodiesel has been introduced as an alternative due to its advantages over fossil fuels, which include higher flash point, improved lubricity, and lower toxicity. However, high production cost of biodiesel is one of the major hindrances in making the commercial feasibility of biodiesel viable. Biodiesel can be obtained from various sources such as waste cooking oil, vegetable oil, animal fat, etc. Among these sources, animal fat which is a non-edible feedstock and currently being used in low-cost processes is one of the best options. To make the commercial feasibility of biodiesel viable, this research presents an animal fat-based biodiesel supply chain network design optimization model. The suggested optimization model minimizes the cost of total biodiesel supply chain operations besides minimizing the carbon emissions during the involved operations. The complex and dynamic business environment of the biodiesel supply chain leads to a high degree of uncertainty, as a result, the effectiveness of strategic level decisions is compromised. To model this uncertainty, a solution methodology based on robust possibilistic programming (RPP) is employed. To show the applicability of the proposed model and solution methodology, numerical experiments and sensitivity analysis on a real case study is performed. Case results depict that RPP based solution methodology can achieve efficient solutions having a high degree of robustness. The experimental results also indicate that by investing almost 16% higher cost, the strategic and tactical level decisions of the proposed biodiesel supply chain model can be secured against the inherent uncertainty. It is also revealed that for the given case, logistics-related activities are almost 80% of the total supply chain cost, which if managed efficiently, can play a significant role in making the commercial feasibility of biodiesel doable. The proposed model and its findings can be efficiently utilized by the policymakers and investors in the animal fat-based biodiesel production sector.}

In this paper, a real-world application of mobile factories in the chemical industry is studied. Critical production assets (e.g. reactor) are carried by truck and can produce a product family locally. For this purpose, a mixed-integer mathematical model is developed to optimize the logistics costs of MSCs, concerning retailer/job-order allocation, production scheduling, and MF routing. The proposed optimization model is overly complex due to the three NP-hard sub-problems. Therefore, a neighborhood search and an evolutionary algorithm are developed to solve the problem in large-scale data sets. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithms can find a near-optimal solution in a reasonable time.}

Among three collection models, the third-party incorporates technological innovation to filter and classify recycled products according to quality. Our results suggest, firstly, regulatory pressure serves as an effective emission-curbing measure in the forward logistics. Secondly, the effect of emission reduction investment under the third party-led collection is superior to that under the other two collection models. Thirdly, from the perspective of economic benefit, the optimal recycling channel for manufacturers is related to the fixed cost of establishing a recycling channel. From the perspectives of environmental benefit and social welfare, the third party-led collection is the optimal strategy.}

An illustrative case-study was presented for lignin extraction in eucalyptus Kraft Pulp mills in Brazil. Land availability, forest productivity, and interest rates were fundamental for the location and sizing of production facilities. Logistics networks prioritized the minimization of sales taxes over transportation distance. The precipitation technology has become financially attractive in a scenario with a 50% lignin price increase. The optimal technology location was Sao Paulo due to lower opportunities costs and markets’ vicinity. These outcomes highlight the importance of the whole supply chain evaluation in biorefinery design.}

This paper proposes a novel probabilistic linguistic decision-making method with consistency improvement algorithm and data envelopment analysis (DEA) cross-efficiency. Firstly, we put forward the concept of order consistency of probabilistic linguistic preference relation (PLPR). The order consistency is helpful for DMs to make quick and efficient decision in certain situations. Then, based on the defined multiplicative consistency of PLPR, we develop a consistency improvement algorithm to transform the unacceptable multiplicative consistent PLPRs into the acceptable ones. Furthermore, a DEA model is established to derive the priority weight vector of alternatives from the acceptable multiplicative consistent PLPR. Meanwhile, for the alternatives that have equal priority weights, we use a DEA cross-efficiency model to further differentiate and obtain the final ranking of alternatives. Finally, a numerical example of emergency logistics distribution selection is given to illustrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed method.}

abstract = {Construction site layout planning (CSLP) is important to ensure that cost, time, quality and environmental impacts are strictly controlled. Even though extensive research has been conducted on CSLP problems, the effect of the multi-stakeholder interactions on optimal site layout plans has been less studied. Therefore, this paper proposes an agent-based decentralized bi-level mathematical model that incorporates decisions from three stakeholders, to examine the CSLP multi-stakeholder interactions. To solve the model, a particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based solution approach is developed to generate the CSLP, construction material logistics planning (CMLP) and security planning (SP) solutions in an integrated CSLP-CMLP/SP system. Specifically, the stakeholders are modelled as individual agents with respective decisions and objective functions, and the inter-dependencies between the layout planner and the other two stakeholders (i.e. the logistics planner and the safety manager) are simultaneously incorporated and dealt with using the bi-level model. The multi-stakeholder interactions are realized by iteratively updating the individual decisions to determine an optimal integrated solution in which the potential stakeholder conflicts in the construction stage are minimized. A case study is given to validate the practicality of the designed model in addressing the CSLP-CMLP and CSLP-SP interactions. The contributions of this research are its applicability to model the effect of multi-stakeholder interactions in agent-based decentralized models, the design of a PSO-based solution approach to achieve an integrated CSLP-CMLP/SP solution, and the provision of academic and practical guidance for decision makers to further enrich global decentralized CSLP research.}

abstract = {The collection and recycling of end-of-life photovoltaic modules is emerging as a challenge due to the dramatic growing installment of distributed PV systems worldwide. This paper studies the locational strategy for recycling facilities of end-of-life PV modules from the perspective of various stakeholders with a case in Zhejiang province, one of the leading regions in promoting distributed photovoltaic applications in China. The generation of end-of-life modules in the “Million Household Rooftop PV Project” in Zhejiang Province is estimated from 2041 to 2045. The regional reverse logistics network for collection of the retired PV modules is optimized using the Mixed Integer Linear Programing (MILP) model. The article draws on the PV recycling scheme of PV CYCLE in Europe, and proposes the following two scenarios for comparison: (1) Scenario A: Municipal recycling, in which the local government takes the responsibility to establish the collection and recycling infrastructures; and (2) Scenario B: Producer cooperative recycling under Extended Producer Responsibility scheme, in which the PV producers use their sales and customer services network to help collecting the end-of-life PV modules. The different roles of the stakeholders affect the overall locational strategy for recycling. The result shows that: (1) Both scenarios result in similar path of the utility of recycling facilities: when only one recycling facility is needed in 2041, the recycling plant in Hangzhou will be used to minimize the overall transportation cost for the whole province; while more facilities are needed due to increasing generation of end-of-life modules in the next 4 years, regional collection centers will be assigned to the nearest recycling facility, dividing the province into three regional recycling group: “North Group (including Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou)”, “South Group (including Jinhua, Lishui, and Quzhou)”, and the “Coastal Group (including Wenzhou and Taizhou)”. (2) Although the overall cost of reverse logistic in scenario B is slightly higher than scenario A at the beginning in 2041, integrating the producer's sales and service network into the collection network can significantly lower the overall reverse logistics cost up to 9.7 percent at the end of the 2043 when the waste PV generation achieves 72 thousand ton/year. The conclusion suggests the necessity to introduce the Extended Producer Responsibility principle in Chinese PV market to encourage the industry to participate in the construction of an efficient recycling system for the coming wave of end-of-life PV modules.}

The topological models are leveraged for case adaption, which significantly reduces the engineering effort of adding new fault types to the system, compared to signal-based methods. Furthermore, the approach does not rely on complete fault models existing in advance; thus, the case database can be continuously built up during operation.}

Methods
Experts from different countries experiencing Corona Virus Infectious Disease 2019 (COVID-19) reviewed evidence and country-specific approaches and the results of their interventions.
Results
Three factors are essential: 1. Reintroduction from countries with ongoing community transmission; 2. The need for extensive testing capacity and widespread community testing, and 3. An adequate supply of personal protective equipment, PPE, to protect health care workers. Discussed at length are lifting physical distancing, how to open manufacturing and construction, logistics, and the opening of higher educational institutions and schools. The use of electronic surveillance is considered.
Conclusion
Each country should decide on the best path forward. However, we can learn from each other, and the approaches are, in reality, very similar.}

abstract = {Purpose
The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic presented unique challenges to lung transplant (LTx) programs. On the donor side, infection concerns resulted in a dramatic reduction in donor lung offers and raised the specter of viral transmission to procurement team members. On the recipient side, the need for pre-transplant COVID-19 testing and COVID free patient care units presented unprecedented logistical challenges. New indications for ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) also emerged, including logistics (e.g. providing adequate time for recipient COVID testing), and donor lung evaluation following 3rd party procurement. In this study, we defined the novel roles of EVLP that our LTx program developed during the COVI-19 pandemic.
Methods
Retrospective analysis of adult LTx procedures performed at our institute from March 17th (when COVID restrictions began at our institute) through May 31st 2020, compared to LTx performed during the same period in 2019.
Results
During the study period, 17 LTx were performed. Eight of 17 were performed after EVLP evaluation, and 6 with EVLP back-up. Notably, the number of LTx after EVLP doubled vs. the same period in 2019, and the number of LTx cases with EVLP backup tripled (Figure 1A). Indications for EVLP in 4 LTx cases and 4 cases with EVLP backup were unique to pandemic conditions (Figure 1B). To date, no patients transplanted during this period, or team members tested positive for COVID-19, or are suspected of COVID infection post-LTx. 30-day survival was 100%, and incidence of primary graft dysfunction grades 0, 1, 2, and 3 at 72 hours post-transplant were 39%, 52%, 4%, and 4%, respectively. Median ventilation duration was 1 day.
Conclusion
Maintaining LTx activity with EVLP was feasible in the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. EVLP enabled our team to solve challenges with donor evaluation and logistics. By enabling donor assessment after local procurement, EVLP also increased the procurement team's safety. In the future, these newer EVLP indications may be applicable beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.}

abstract = {Introduction
This retrospective analysis was performed to find out if clusters of mineralized chorionic villi can be regarded as an independent feature of fetal vascular malperfusion (FVM).
Methods
Of all 1698 placentas reviewed by the author during the last 10 years, 39 (2.3%) showed clusters of mineralized chorionic villi (Group 1), 100 cases (5.9%) showed randomly scattered mineralized chorionic villi with without clustering (Group 2), and the remaining 1559 placentas showed no villous mineralization (comparative Group 3). In doubtful cases, histochemistry stains were performed to determine the pattern of villous mineralization. Twenty three independent clinical and 43 placental variables were statistically compared among the groups: descriptive statistics (Chi-square, Fisher test or signed rank test), and logistics regression model.
Results
Clinically, Group 1 featured shorter gestational age than Group 2, and in addition to shorter gestational age, more common oligohydramnios, polyhydramnios, induction of labor, macerated stillbirth and fetal growth restriction than Group 3. Of placental variables, fetal vascular ectasia, and clusters of avascular chorionic villi were more common in Group 1 than in Group 2, and in addition, segmental villous stromal vascular karyorrhexis was more common than in Group 3. By the logistics regression mode, segmental villous mineralization was independently associated with other histological features of FVM as a group and particularly with clusters of sclerotic chorionic villi.
Discussion
FVM is characterized by temporal heterogeneity, i.e. coexistence of lesions of various duration, and strongly and independently correlates with clusters of mineralized chorionic villi. Therefore, segmental villous mineralization should be included into the category of segmental FVM. It can be seen even in totally fibrotic placentas of prolonged stillbirth when other histological features of segmental vascular malperfusion can be obscured by global villous sclerosis.}

Separate optimization of the reverse and forward logistics may cause sub-optimality; hence, the integrated optimization is taken into account. In this paper, respecting both forward and reverse flows simultaneously, a multi-stage closed-loop supply chain is developed with some dedicated and hybrid facilities. Since in many industries the demand depends on selling price, a price-sensitive demand is taken into consideration. Accordingly, a mixed integer linear programming model is developed to make location, allocation, and price decisions, with the aim of maximizing total profit regarding capacity and number of opened facilities constraints. Given that the proposed model is not easily solved through exact methods, a relatively new population-based metaheuristic, namely firefly algorithm (FA) is proposed to find the solutions of large-scale problems. The proposed FA uses an efficient solution representation based on the priority-based encoding. Moreover, the algorithm utilizes a heuristic backward procedure for decoding. The proposed approach efficiency is checked by GAMS/CPLEX solver for small-sized problems. For large-sized problems, the performance is compared with a differential evolution algorithm, a genetic algorithm, and an FA relying on the conventional priority-based encoding through statistical tests and a chess rating system. The results indicate the superiority of the proposed approach in both FA structure and encoding-decoding procedure.}

Then, simulation is used as a tool for testing scenarios and choosing changes required by the company. In this paper a literature review will present existing concepts, methods and tools (theory of systems, Industry 4.0 concepts, etc.) which could be used for defining the general approach, the decision aided tool and the joinery reference model, in order to transform with success a joinery company.

Consequently, it is necessary a transition to a circular economy model so that environmental problems may be avoided. Brazilian authorities have already been mobilized to seek ways to transitioning, and one way is centered on reverse logistics and shared responsibility for solid waste management laid down in Law No. 12,305/2010. However, this transition does not occur smoothly due to solid waste management in Brazil involves different segments of society, which implies different responsibilities for each segment, as well as a good interaction between them, but there is not an adequate approach to define the responsibilities. Therefore, this study seeks to develop a collaborative approach capable of defining responsibilities towards solid waste management. The proposed approach embedded three methods: Value Focused Thinking, Flexible and Interactive Tradeoff, and Shapley value. The approach was applied to a craft brewery located in a northeastern Brazilian city. The findings show that segments were able to define sustainable responsibilities for the tactical performance of solid waste management in transitioning to a circular economy.}

abstract = {There is growing interest in re-localization and re-connection of agriculture and food consumption, and Short Food Supply Chains (SFSCs) are becoming more and more popular. However, there are few studies on their environmental performance. Existing studies focus primarily on comparing imports and domestic consumption, often according to a single environmental criterion (i.e., energy or carbon footprint), without considering the great diversity of subnational commercialization patterns. This paper aims at assessing the environmental sustainability of different archetypes of food supply chains, from global ones to short ones, to identify hotspots and discuss the conditions under which a given supply chain performs better than another one. The overall methodology is based on a full Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) with a focus on a fresh and unprocessed product: apples purchased in an urban area. First, a consistent definition and classification of supply chains, is provided based on geographical and organizational features. An innovative approach is then developed to compute logistics data representative of these supply chains, using Geographic Information System tools. Finally, a comparison of the environmental performances of archetypes of apple supply chains is provided. The results show the relatively good environmental performance of the national long food supply chain which is used as the reference scenario in this study. Moreover, there are great differences in the environmental performance of SFSCs. Direct off-farm sales have the same level of performance as the reference. On the other hand, direct on-farm sales can be very impactful. Results also highlight the impacts of the final consumer trip which are significant and highly variable, depending on consumer-retailer distance, weight of apples purchased, and transport means used. This variability leads to reconsidering the questions frequently asked in LCAs of systems with extreme sensitivity to highly variable parameters. The concern is no longer whether one scenario is better than another, but to determine the values of those parameters that allow for better performance. Focusing on these parameters has direct implications in terms of decision-making by providing straightforward results with operational recommendations that are understandable to the general public, and not only LCA indicators.}

Synthetic seeds were produced by mixing fragmented gametophyte and alginate matrix. The gametophyte regenerated regardless of the syringe tip size and the injection molding type employed, to successfully form the sporophyte. The synthetic seeds were successfully stored short-term under cold storage (4 °C). The storage period influenced the percentage of sporophyte formation, which was 70.8% or more until day 7, but decreased to 56.9% or less after day 14 of storage. However, the storage period of 7 days is sufficient for short-distance transport. The development of gametophyte-derived synthetic seeds improves the logistics of transport and handling ferns, and it enables establishment of plug seedling cultivation.}

A comprehensive review produces three project inquiries into the continued reliance on oil and implications of greater moves toward renewable sources of energy. A situation audit appraises Indonesia's place in the global politics of oil supply, its domestic logistics, its continuing oil subsidy, and positioning toward fossil fuel emissions and renewable energy. Shortcoming are identified in the nation's high dependency on fossil fuels and, in particular, oil imports; the extent of its oil subsidy; a lack of strategic oil buffers; insufficient attention to emissions; and contradictory policies towards renewable energy. The article concludes by presenting a research agenda to support the transition of Indonesia's energy mix and security to 2050.}

In this work, we aim to uncover the behaviour of a planning agent by means of Behaviour Trees (BTs), a flexible and controllable mathematical model of plan execution used to describe flows between tasks in a modular fashion. We analyze the behaviour of a planning agent when solving a simple logistics problem by comparing the agent’s plan with the plans resulting from various BTs, each representing a different behaviour. We propose different distance metrics as a similarity measurement between plans and we evaluate their accuracy at identifying similar behaviours.}

The role played by facility and layout planning in logistic distribution centers has a great impact on the performance of parcel sortation. In this study, a simulation-optimization approach is adopted to solve the sortation conveyor layout problem, particularly the design of shortcuts in the sortation system that enhances processing capacity. The capacity is defined by the throughput of the sortation system. A genetic algorithm with local search is proposed to find the optimal design of the sortation system. Simulation is used to evaluate the performance of algorithm results. Moreover, an experimental design is applied to optimize the parameter setting of the algorithm and the system. A practical case is studied to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach.}

abstract = {The last-mile (LM) delivery is probably one of the most expensive and complex among global Supply Chain processes, and it suffers from problems such as road traffic congestion. On the other hand, urban goods delivery systems can be held accountable for the same negative externalities they suffer. The complexity of last-mile delivery systems arises from the heterogeneity of stakeholders and their objectives. In this context, local retailers might be called upon to adopt innovative last-mile delivery services offered by Logistics Service Providers (LSPs). The attractiveness of selected LM initiatives to local retailers has been explored by a stream of literature that focuses on the utility provided to the retailer by a sub-set of initiatives s, based on the retailers’ preferred requirements. With this paper, we aim to build on this stream of literature by analyzing the perception of local retailers regarding the value proposition of a wider set of LM delivery innovations, including the ones that do not comprise retailers among their paying customers. To this end, a survey is submitted to retailers of different sizes and type located in the limited traffic zone (LTZ) of Turin (Italy). Through the survey, we aim to assess the relative importance of nine service requirements retrieved from literature, and cluster them into factors, i.e. value propositions, by means of a confirmatory factor analysis. Results show that retailers are able to accept higher costs for the delivery for deliveries that are more reliable and for the reduction of stock. Retailers also appear to correlate punctuality and flexibility of the LM delivery service, because flexible and on time deliveries allow for better inventory management, higher control and in turn improved customer service level by the retailer. The convenience of the delivery service is seen as correlated with its sustainability, because logistics activities can be carried out with small and low impact vehicles that allowing easier deliveries into the city center. The highlighted factors serve as a basis for the value propositions to be taken into account by practitioners in the design of LM innovations.}

Existing evidence suggests that the harmonisation of standards to international benchmarks reduces compliance costs and is less trade-inhibiting, or may even be trade-promoting. This paper thus investigates how the regulatory margin in food standards affects Africa’s fish exports to the EU. We measure the regulatory margin in standards by comparing EU standards to the international scientifically-formulated benchmarks. Our results indicate that, relative to the international standards, EU fish standards are indeed non-inhibiting. Thus, the high number of fish exports from Africa rejected by the EU due to non-compliance with EU standards does not really suggest that the measures are overly restrictive but rather is an indication of the poor quality of Africa’s fish exports. This finding suggests a need for upgrades to Africa’s fish export quality, especially the fish supply chain infrastructure, through continuous improvements in fish export logistics facilitation and export promotion measures.}

However, no approach has been developed to holistically quantify and optimize the carbon reduction/economic costs trade-off for the modular construction supply planning (MCSP). This paper introduces a two-period based equilibrium strategy that fully considers the procurement-prefabrication-assembly logistics optimization to determine an economic costs/environmental impact balance in modular construction. The proposed methodology is capable of optimizing the preparation and construction schemes and dynamic transportation arrangements under multiple carbon-economy preference scenarios. By employing uncertain parameters to account for the material and delivery cost fluctuations, the model can accurately depict the industry characteristics of modular construction supply. A case study from Florida is then conducted to validate the practicality and robustness of the equilibrium strategy. The applications indicate that the proposed methodology can assist the construction enterprises to systematically reduce carbon emissions and serve as decision support for modular construction supply planning.}

These processes are becoming more complex with the gradual globalization. As the complexity of the supply chain increases, so does the risk of disruption. There are problems such as a lack of information on the origin of the products, a lack of real-time information and, with that, a problem with tracking shipments. With a large number of documents, the risk of fraud and forgery also increases. Due to the large number of stakeholders in logistics chains, the level of transparency is being lost. One possible solution to eliminate the risk of supply chain complexity is to integrate blockchain technology into the supply chain. Thanks to properties such as distribution, immutability, transparency, blockchain can have great potential to solve the problems of the traditional supply chain. The aim of this paper is to describe the basic problems of the traditional supply chain, which can disrupt its course. In the next part, we will introduce the basics of blockchain technology and describe what processes of the traditional supply chain could be replaced by this technology.}

Strict COVID-19 lockdowns made home delivery an essential service and a lifeline for many households that, for travel restrictions or health concerns, were not able to utilize traditional shopping methods. This research studies the impact of socio-demographic variables and e-commerce attitudes on household deliveries for seven product categories (groceries, meals, electronics, household and office goods, recreational items, and fashion, beauty and personal care products, and medicine/health-related products) during the lockdown period in the greater Portland metropolitan region. To understand these impacts, exploratory factor analysis and choice models with latent variables are estimated utilizing data collected from an online survey representing the population in the greater Portland metropolitan region. The results indicate that each factor has a unique profile in terms of significant socio-demographic variables. A novel contribution of this research is to study the impact on home deliveries of non-traditional variables like health and safety concerns and the presence of household members with disabilities during a pandemic. The results show that health concerns are very influential and that there are substantial differences across factors on delivery rate and expenditure levels. Key findings and perspectives regarding future delivery rates and implications for transportation agencies and logistics companies are discussed.}

Among them, we can highlight the problem of transporting customers from origin to destination locations, which is known as the dial-a-ride problem (DARP). This problem consists of designing least-cost routes to serve pickup-and-delivery requests, while meeting capacity, time window, maximum route duration, and maximum ride time constraints. This work proposes a hybrid algorithm to solve single and multi-depot DARP variants where both the demands and vehicle fleet are heterogeneous. The method combines the iterated local search metaheuristic with an exact procedure based on a set partitioning approach. In addition, several procedures were implemented to speedup the local search phase. Extensive computational experiments were conducted on existing and newly proposed benchmark instances in order to evaluate the impact of the different components of the algorithm, and to compare its performance against the best existing method. The results obtained suggest that the proposed algorithm is capable of producing highly competitive results regarding both solution quality and CPU time, and of improving several best known solutions.}

The objective of this paper is to identify the stakeholders' requirements and critical success factors (CSFs) for the sustainability initiative in SC during this pandemic situation. Three potential stakeholders' requirements and a total of 16 critical success factors have been identified by taking inputs from experts and decision-makers. Further, these critical factors are analyzed and ranked based on a hybrid quality function deployment (QFD)-best-worst methodology (BWM). The QFD method has been used to identify the stakeholder’ requirements. And, the BWM has been adopted to prioritize the CSFs. The scientific value of the study is the contribution of the framework model for the sustainable initiatives in the SC during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, identification of stakeholders’ requirements and CSFs, and prioritizes these CSFs. The top three most critical success factors are found to be social distancing, emergency logistics systems, and emergency backup facilities. The proposed framework provides a roadmap to operation and supply chain managers to come up with good solutions for sustainability initiatives in the supply chain during and after the pandemic outbreak.}
