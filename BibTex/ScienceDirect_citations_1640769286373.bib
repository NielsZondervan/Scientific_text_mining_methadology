abstract = {This paper analyzes the impacts of carbon emission regulations on the traditional inventory routing problem (IRP). We first present the traditional IRP model, which is an inbound commodity collection system consisting of one assembly plant and a set of geographically dispersed suppliers. At the beginning of each period, a fleet of capacitated identical vehicles depart the depot to pick up products from suppliers to meet the assembly plant’s demand, which is deterministic and time-varying. We use fixed transportation cost, fuel consumption cost and inventory holding cost to evaluate the system’s total cost, in which fuel consumption cost is determined by fuel consumption rate, distance and fuel price. Then we investigate the impacts of carbon emission regulations on the traditional IRP problem, wherein carbon emissions are generated by fuel consumption. A series of mixed integer nonlinear programming models are constructed and linearization methods are used. A hybrid genetic algorithm based on allocation first and routing second is proposed to find near-optimal solutions for these problems. Numerical tests are performed to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, and several managerial insights are observed from parameter sensitive analyses which may help both the government and the industry to adopt appropriate carbon reduction regulations.}

abstract = {This paper models a three echelon supply chain distribution problem considering multiple time periods, multi-products and uncertain demands. To take the problem closer to reality we consider multiple truck types and focus on the truck selection and loading sub-problem. Truck selection is important because the quantity of goods to be transported varies regularly and also because different trucks have different hiring cost, mileage and speed. Truck loading is important when considering the optimal loading pattern of products having different shapes and sizes on trucks, which themselves have distinct loading capacities. The two objectives considered here are the cost and responsiveness of the supply chain. The distribution problem is solved using the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II). However, the genetic algorithms compromise the optimality of the sub-problems while optimizing the entire system. But the optimality of truck selection and loading sub-problem is non-compromisable in nature. Hence a heuristic algorithm is used innovatively along with the NSGA-II to produce much better solutions. To make our model more realistic, the distribution chain is modelled as a push–pull based supply chain having multiple time periods and using demand aggregation over time. Using a separate algorithm also gives the advantage of utilizing the difference in nature of the push and pull part of the supply chain by giving every individual truck different objectives. Real life like data is generated and the optimality gap between the heuristic and non-heuristic approach is calculated. A clear improvement in objectives can be seen while using the heuristic approach.}

Although organizations are motivated to find ways to improve analytic capabilities and using these methods has been shown to improve some measures of data quality, there is little understanding of the tangible and intangible outcomes of employing these methods. In this study, we explore outcomes that arise from a data quality improvement process implementation in an operations management environment. Over a three-year period, we conducted a longitudinal single case study at an organization that maintains a large fleet of aircraft, collecting and analyzing qualitative interviews and observations. The findings suggest outcomes (both positive and cautionary) associated with the implementation of data quality improvement processes. These include increased stakeholder commitment to data quality and business analytics, as well as an over-emphasis on program metrics to the peril of operational outcomes, among others. From the basis of our findings, we construct a research agenda, which includes testable Propositions regarding outcomes of data quality improvement.}

These measures, however, do not take into account that customers will tolerate a reasonable delay and therefore, a firm does not incur reputation costs if customers wait less than their tolerable wait. Accordingly, we generalize the expected waiting time and fill rate measures to reflect customer patience. These generalized measures are termed the truncated waiting time and the window fill rate, respectively. We develop efficient algorithms to solve the problem for each of the criteria and demonstrate how incorporating customer patience provides considerable savings and profoundly affects the optimal spares allocation.}

abstract = {Oil exploration in Brazil is mainly held by offshore platforms which require the supply of several products, including diesel to maintain its engines. One strategy to supply diesel to the platforms is to keep a vessel filled with diesel nearby the exploration basin. An empty boat leaves the port and goes directly to this vessel, then it is loaded with diesel. After that, it makes a trip to supply the platforms and when the boat is empty, it returns to the vessel to be reloaded with more diesel going to another trip. Based on this description, this paper proposes a mathematical model based on the Vehicle Routing Problem with Intermediate Replenishment Facilities (VRPIRF) to solve the problem. The purpose of the model is to plan the routes for the boats to meet the diesel requests of the platform. Given the fact that in the literature, papers about the VRPIRF are scarce and papers about the VRPIRF applied to offshore platforms were not found in the published papers, this paper is important to contribute with the evolution of this class of problem, bringing also a solution for a real application that is very important for the oil and gas business. The mathematical model was tested using the CPLEX 12.6. In order to assess the mathematical model, tests were done with data from the major Brazilian oil and gas company and several strategies were tested.}

The model is formulated based on a graph such that each node represents a location in the warehouse at the end of a specific scheduling stage, and each edge indicates a crane's move between two locations in a stage. Variables reduction strategies are presented to accelerate solving the model. In order to solve large-sized instances of the problem, an exact dynamic programming approach based on optimal assignments between coils and positions in a bipartite network with cuts is designed by exploiting the problem structure. Then an approximate dynamic programming (ADP) approach is developed, in which an affine value function approximation is defined as the estimation of crane's traveling time for handling each coil, and updated via iterations by collecting information from the solutions of separate subproblems. Computational results show that the proposed model is tighter and can be solved much more quickly than a traditional model for a reduced crane scheduling problem in the literature and the standard time-space network flow model. Besides, the proposed algorithm can obtain high quality solutions for large-sized instances in a few minutes and is more efficient in solving the problem than a commercial software package.}

abstract = {The ever-growing applications of Additive Manufacturing (AM) in the production of low volume- high value metal parts can be attributed to improving AM processing capabilities and complex design freedom. However, secondary post-processing using traditional processes such as machining, grinding, heat treatment and hot isostatic pressing, i.e., Hybrid Manufacturing, is required to achieve Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&T), surface finish and desired mechanical properties. It is often challenging for most traditional manufacturers to participate in the rapidly evolving supply chain of direct digital manufacturing (DDM) through in-house investments in cost prohibitive metal AM. This research investigates a system of strategically-located AM hubs which can integrate hybrid-AM with the capabilities and excess capacity in multiple traditional manufacturing facilities. Using North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) data for machine shops in the U.S., an uncapacitated facility location model is used to determine the optimal locations for AM hub centers based on: (1) geographical data, (2) demand and (3) cost of hybrid-AM processing. Results from this study have identified: (a) candidate US counties to build AM hubs, (b) total cost (fixed, operational and transportation) and (c) capacity utilization of the AM hubs. It was found that uncapacitated facility location models identified demand centroid as the optimal location and was affected only by AM utilization rate whereas a constrained p-median model identified 22 AM hub locations as the initial sites for AM hubs which grows to 44 AM hubs as demand increases. It was also found that transportation cost was not a significant factor in the hybrid-AM supply chain. Findings from this study will help both AM companies and traditional manufacturers to determine location in the U.S and key factors to advance the metal hybrid-AM supply chain.}

In these urban terminals, freight flows from interurban carriers are consolidated and transferred to a neutral last-mile carrier to perform final deliveries. This operation would reduce both last-mile fleet size and average distance cost. Our UCC modeling approach is focused on continuous analytic models for the general case of carriers with different market shares. Savings are highly sensitive to the design of the system: the increment of capacity in interurban vehicles and the proximity of the UCC terminal to the area in relation to current distribution centers. An exhaustive collection of possible market shares distributions are discussed. Results show that market shares distribution does not affect cost savings significantly. The analysis of the proposed model also highlights the trade-off between savings in the system and a minimum market share per company when the consolidation center is established.}

Therefore UCCs are often heavily subsidised and tend to disappear as soon as the subsidies stop. This paper reports on a social cost-benefit analysis (SCBA) of an operational UCC in the Belgian city of Antwerp. The SCBA is based on real data and volumes. It concerns a private initiative that is not dependent upon subsidies and is located in an area with considerable problems (e.g., average delays of 28%). Results show that the consolidated deliveries are beneficial for society. Based on current volumes during the start-up period it is, however, not financially viable. The business volume lies considerably higher. This study shows that there is potential to reach a break-even turnover. Outcomes are linked to the transferability of the concept to other urban areas.}

Optimizing order picking planning problems sequentially may yield a suboptimal overall warehouse performance. Still, previous warehouse planning reviews focus on individual planning problems. This literature review differs by investigating combinations of multiple order picking planning problems. A state-of-the-art review and classification of the scientific literature investigating combinations of tactical and operational order picking planning problems in picker-to-parts systems is presented with the aim of determining how planning problems are related. Furthermore, this literature review aims to find excellent policy combinations and to provide guidelines how warehouse managers can benefit from combining planning problems, in order to design efficient order picking systems and improve customer service.

In such settings, components may have different features such as volume, weight, bill of material coefficient, etc. Additionally, a given component may have several alternative variants among which a single one is used in the assembly of end products. Each variant is thus characterized by a varying degree of usage rate. Hence, the diversity of parts requires the selection of the best assembly line feeding mode that aims at minimizing the average total operating cost which mainly consists of labor costs associated with parts preparation before assembly, transportation to the line, picking operations during assembly, as well as parts storage cost. This paper proposes an optimization model that assigns each individual component to the most efficient line feeding mode among three alternatives which are line stocking, kitting and sequencing modes. The developed mixed integer program is applied to a first tier supplier plant in the automotive sector. Based on this model, insight is gained on the trade-off to be considered when deciding the more appropriate line feeding mode for each individual component and how system parameters impact this trade-off.}

Problems in these classes generalize classical vehicle routing problems enlarging the decision space to optimize a broader system. The resulting problems are computationally harder to solve but offer opportunities to achieve remarkable additional savings. In this paper, we address the issue of quantifying the potential benefit deriving from tackling directly such complex problems instead of solving the individual problems in a not integrated manner. To this aim, we consider as a proof of concept the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) with Two-dimensional Loading constraints (2L-CVRP), a variant of the CVRP where rectangular-shaped items have to be delivered to customers and loading constraints have to be satisfied. We consider the 2L-CVRP in an integrated manner and compare the solutions with those obtained from three not integrated approaches based on addressing separately the routing and the loading problems. The importance of an integrated approach for the 2L-CVRP is validated through the study of the worst-case performance of the not integrated approaches, and conducting computational experiments on benchmark and new instances.}

The emergence of supply networks poses new challenges derived from a growing complexity in coordinating the flow of resources, materials, and information within and among an increasing number of network participants. In such situations, an intelligent resource distribution under various constraints is one of the most critical problems. In this paper, we have developed a novel Constrained-Collaboration Algorithm (CCA) for physically cooperative resource distribution planning. Based on Collaborative Control Theory (CCT) with theoretical formulations and network flow approaches, the CCA addresses an efficient and effective resource distribution by a suitable form of physical cooperation. We have applied it to an actual industry case, in combination with Direct/Indirect Delivery Protocol (DIDP), introduced in previous research. As a result, the integrated model achieves 55% increase in resource utilization and 20% reduction in distribution cost, while accommodating external changes. Besides, the new formalism of the physical dimension of collaboration requirement planning introduced in this research with new CCA approach can be generalized for other improvements in supply-and-demand management decision support.}

At each time period, a fixed transportation cost can be paid to buy a transportation capacity. If the transportation capacity is used, the supplier also pays an uncertain unit transportation cost. A unit inventory cost is charged for the unsatisfied demand. The aim is to determine the transportation capacities to buy and the quantity to send at each time period in order to minimize the expected total cost. We prove that this problem is NP-hard, we propose a multi-stage stochastic optimization model formulation, and we determine optimal policies for particular cases, with deterministic unit transportation costs or demand and zero fixed costs. Furthermore, we provide the worst–case analysis of the rolling horizon approach, a classical heuristic approach for solving multi-stage stochastic programming models, applied to this NP-hard problem and to polynomially solvable particular cases. Worst–case results show that the rolling horizon approach can be very suboptimal. We also provide experimental results.}

Furthermore, we investigated input–output-processes in nature, especially the webs of orb-weaver spiders (Araneidae), to mimic the pattern for factory layouts. In addition, the hunting behaviour of the spider was examined and imitated. To prove the feasibility of the proposed methodology, the first step was to collect material flow data from three Austrian factories. We implemented the original factory layouts within our model as reference. As second step, we applied traditional logistical methods for layout planning according to theory. In a third step, we applied our nautilus shell and spider web layout approach to arrange the material flow system of the three factories.

Retail companies increasingly are investing in unpacking operations at their distribution centres (DC). Given the opportunity to unpack at the DC requires a decision as to which products should be selected for unpacking at the DC and which should be shipped to stores in a case pack (CP) or outer pack provided by the supplier. The combined unpacking and unit size decision is evaluated by focusing on the relevant costs at the DC and in-store, i.e., picking in the DC, unpacking either in the DC or in the store, shelf stacking in the store and refilling from the backroom. For replenishing stores, an (R, s, nQ) inventory policy is considered when using the supplier CP and a (R, s, S) policy when the product is unpacked at the DC. Expressions are developed to quantify the relevant volumes and to calculate the corresponding costs on which the unpacking decision is based. A numerical example with empirical data from a European modern retailer demonstrates that unpacking a subset of the stock keeping units (SKUs) at the DC results in a significant cost reduction potential of 8% compared to no unpacking at the DC. The example shows that DC unpacking can generally be highly favorable for a large share of products.}

abstract = {We analyzed the economic feasibility and environmental benefits of an alternative technology that converts coal and biomass to liquid fuels (CBTL), using West Virginia as a real case scenario. A mixed integer linear programming model was developed to analyze the economic feasibility. A cradle-to-grave life cycle assessment (LCA) model was also developed to analyze the environmental benefits. Sensitivity analyses on required selling price (RSP) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of CBTL fuels were conducted according to feedstock availability and price, biomass to coal mix ratio, conversion rate, internal rate of return (IRR), capital cost, operational and maintenance cost. The results showed the price of coal had a more dominant effect on RSP than that of biomass. Different mix ratios and conversion rates led to RSP ranging from $104.3 – $157.9/bbl. LCA results indicated that GHG emissions ranged from 80.62 kg CO2 eq to 101.46 kg CO2 eq/1000 MJ of liquid fuel at various biomass to coal mix ratios and conversion rates if carbon capture and storage (CCS) was applied. Most of the water and fossil energy were consumed in the conversion process. Compared to petroleum-derived-liquid fuels, the reduction in GHG emissions could be between −2.7% and 16.2% with CBTL substitution.}

Ports can be severely affected by these changes; therefore, ports need insight into how the system might change and what the impact of this will be on their competitive position. Given the intrinsic complexity of the container transport system and the presence of a wide range of deeply uncertain factors affecting the system, we use an exploratory modeling approach to study future scenarios for the global container network. Using scenario discovery and worst-case discovery, we assess the implications of various uncertain factors on the competitive position of the port of Rotterdam. It is found that overall the competitive position of Rotterdam is quite robust with respect to the various uncertain factors. The main vulnerability is the quality of the hinterland connections. A modest deterioration of the quality of the hinterland connections, resulting in increased travel time, will result in a loss of throughput for Rotterdam.}

abstract = {Introduction
A modern treatment of patients with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is based on a rapid primary percutaneous coronary intervention with direct recanalization of the affected coronary artery (dPCI). The outcome of the treatment depends largely on the pre-hospital care management, which can reduce the total ischaemic time and subsequently improve patient's outlook.
Aims
The principal aims of this retrospective study were to assess the development of time intervals related to the pre-hospital care and the effect of the mode of transportation to the cathlab (primary vs secondary) on these intervals in patients with acute STEMI treated by primary PCI in 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014 and 2016.
Methods
We have analysed patients with STEMI treated using PCI within 12h of symptoms onset. In total, 1250 patients were included. To evaluate the development over the last 8 years, uni- and multivariate analyses were used. Categorical variables were analysed using chi-squared tests while continuous variables were analysed using one-way ANOVA and general linear models. The effect of the year and of mode of transportation on time intervals were studied.
Results
The time intervals did not significantly differ among years with the exception of 2014 where the reason of the deviation was however not related to the quality of the pre-hospital care. The 120min limit from the first medical contact to unblocking the affected artery (FMCTB) was met in more than 80% patients (80.8), the recommended limit of 90min in 55.2% of patients. The key factor affecting the total ischaemic time was however the patients’ choice of the mode of transportation – in patients who opted for the primary route of transportation, i.e., called the ambulance, the intervals were significantly shorter (FMCTB on average by 38.2min and total ischaemic time by 92.9min). The principal delays were detected in the patients’ delay (103min inpatients with primary transportation route, 131 in patients with secondary route) as well as, unfortunately, in the intervals between reporting the patients’ problem to the system and ECG-confirmed diagnosis (26min if the patient calls ambulance vs 52min if they present at a general practitioner or outpatient clinic) and subsequent transportation to the cathlab (60min for primary route, 97 for secondary). The latter two should be in particular targeted and we can see a significant room for improvement here.
Conclusion
The time intervals do not vary among individual years (with some exceptions). The route of transportation, which is a patient's choice, on the total ischaemic time is however a crucial and predominant factor affecting the total ischaemic time as well as individual intervals.}

abstract = {Given a set of customer orders and a routing policy, the goal of the order-batching problem (OBP) is to group customer orders to picking orders (batches) such that the total length of all tours through a rectangular warehouse is minimized. Because order picking is considered the most labor-intensive process in warehousing, effectively batching customer orders can result in considerable savings. The OBP is NP-hard if the number of orders per batch is greater than two, and the exact solution methods proposed in the literature are not able to consistently solve larger instances. To address larger instances, we develop a metaheuristic hybrid based on adaptive large neighborhood search and tabu search, called ALNS/TS. In numerical studies, we conduct an extensive comparison of ALNS/TS to all previously published OBP methods that have used standard benchmark sets to investigate their performance. ALNS/TS outperforms all comparison methods with respect to both average solution quality and run-time. Compared to the state-of-the-art, ALNS/TS shows the clearest advantages on the larger instances of the existing benchmark sets, which assume a higher number of customer orders and higher capacities of the picking device. Finally, ALNS/TS is able to solve newly generated large-scale instances with up to 600 customer orders and six articles per customer order with reasonable run-times and convincing scaling behavior and robustness.}

abstract = {Middle and long-term inventory-production plans have deserved interest of managers of supply chains since the 80’s. However, from 90’s to now, to plan a reverse channel has been also an important business practice. This paper deals with such an issue. In this way, a chance constraint, stochastic quadratic problem subject to linear discrete-time inventory-production systems is formulated. The objective of this problem is to meet the demand for a single product, which can be manufactured from a forward channel and/or remanufactured (refurbished) from a backward channel. The demand fluctuation is a random variable, with mean and standard-deviation known over time. On the other hand, the return rate is assumed deterministic, but with some periods of delay over the planning horizon. The random nature of demand fluctuation affects the variability of serviceable inventory variable in the sense of its variance increases over periods of planning horizon. In order to mitigate such variability, a feedback gain, which relates remanufactured/refurbished rate to serviceable inventory level, is considered. This gain is obtained from a minimum variance problem. As a result, an optimal plan is developed from an equivalent Mean Value problem that has constraints regulated by the gain. Through a simple example, it will be shown that the open-loop optimal plan obtained with problem’s constraints fixed by optimal gain has a better performance than the optimal plan provided without such a gain.}

The analysis reveals that previous research has primarily focused on humanitarian operations, with researchers adapting established supply chain methodologies to improve humanitarian disaster response. While this has benefited humanitarian organizations in their ability to respond to disasters with greater efficiency, it also clarifies that there has been little research done on humanitarian development, the overlooked part of humanitarian operations. This finding suggests the need for future research to focus on the role that humanitarian development plays in reducing future social and economic disaster losses.}

In this context, accessibility, or the opportunity for individuals to receive services provided by facilities, and equity, or fairness, among individuals are both important. Accessibility and equity can be negatively impacted when facility location decisions are not coordinated among responding organizations, but coordination is difficult in large-scale humanitarian response efforts. In this paper, we introduce a methodology to quantify the impact on accessibility and equity resulting from lack of coordination in locating post-disaster health care service facilities. Our method includes a dynamic, scenario-based, robust optimization model to choose facility locations that optimize accessibility while ensuring equity. This hypothetical centralized solution may then be compared with actual uncoordinated facility location decisions to identify opportunities for improvement and build support for enhanced coordination. We demonstrate our approach using data from the international response to the 2010 Haiti cholera outbreak.}

In contrast to the existing supply chain network design models, a new application of a CLSC network was studied in this paper to reduce waste. A multi-product, multi-tier mixed integer linear model is developed for a CLSC network design. The main objective is to maximize profit and provide waste management decision support in order to minimize pollution. The result shows applicability of the model in the tire industry.

The optimal solutions of the model are compared with the decisions made in accordance with the manpower policy adopted by a real transhipment container terminal. The experimentation sheds light on when its policy is effective or when there is room for optimisation. The computational tests indicate that the model can be optimally solved even in the case of huge transhipment container terminals.}

abstract = {Order picking describes the process of retrieving items from their storage locations to satisfy customer orders. Because order picking is considered the most labor-intensive process in warehousing, effectively routing order pickers through a warehouse can result in considerable time and cost savings. In practice, picker routing is often influenced by precedence constraints, i.e., the order-picking sequence is partially predetermined due to fragility restrictions, stackability, shape, size, and preferred unloading sequence. Although many warehouses face such precedence constraints for picking items (especially in the grocery sector), they are hardly considered in the scientific literature. This paper is inspired by a practical case observed in a warehouse of a German manufacturer of household products, where heavy items are not allowed to be stored on top of light items to prevent damage to the light items. Currently, the sequence for retrieving the items from their storage locations is determined by applying a picker-routing strategy that neglects this precedence constraint, and the order pickers pack the items respecting their weights after picking. To avoid this sorting effort at the end of the order-picking process, we propose a picker-routing strategy that incorporates the precedence constraint by picking heavy items before light items. We develop an exact solution method to evaluate this strategy. Furthermore, we examine the influence of different problem parameters on the proposed picker-routing strategy, and we derive managerial insights for dealing with precedence constraints in order picking.}

The traffic management system Tristar which is under implementation and its related systems show a potential to assist in development of freight transport measures. Recommendations for urban freight policy development supplementing Gdynia's Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan were used as a basis for identification where ITS/ITC could be implemented. The first stage may involve modelling and analysis of freight vehicle traffic with new multilevel transport model for Gdynia. Other possible measures include, among others provision of dynamic information for vehicle routing and priorities for trucks on selected sections of road network. However, problems with access to reliable data describing delivery vehicle traffic were identified in this early stage as no practical rules for their collection had been developed. Additional problems appear in acquiring urban supply chain characteristics that require collaboration with the private sector. Such studies have not as yet been conducted in Poland. The identified factors indicate the need to precisely specify expected results and the areas of ITS application in Gdynia to prepare for their. Dynamic routing and scheduling with real time information appeared to be the most promising solution applying ITS, with temporary priorities for HGV providing services to the sea port in Gdynia in peak traffic and directing lorries implementation to free parking slots. Experience gained in these applications will be useful in developing other, complex solutions, e.g. in organising distribution in the city centre.}

The simulation component allows developers to estimate the impact of user-defined asset selections on the likely cost and duration of the full or partial completion of the installation process. The optimisation component provides developers with an installation schedule that is robust to changes in operation durations due to weather uncertainties. The combined framework provides a decision-support tool which enhances the individual capability of both models by feedback channels between the two, and provides a mechanism to address current OWF installation projects. The combined framework, verified and validated by external experts, was applied to an installation case study to illustrate the application of the combined approach. An installation schedule was identified which accounted for seasonal uncertainties and optimised the ordering of activities.}

The behavior of truck deliveries is distinctly different from commuter parking: trucks do not cruise for parking spaces, and demand for goods delivery is driven by customers and is practically inelastic to the delivery costs. We generalize the downtown on-street parking model from Arnott and Inci (2006) to study the relationship between passenger vehicles’ parking and truck delivery behaviors, and provide tools for policy makers to optimize the trade-offs in parking space allocation, pricing, and aggregate network congestion. The social optimum can be obtained by solving a nonlinear optimization problem. The parking model is able to replicate the commuter-only scenario as a special case. It is shown that ignoring truck delivery behavior can significantly overestimate travel speeds and cruising stock. We applied the model to a case study of downtown Toronto and found that compared to a baseline scenario representative of Toronto in 2015, increasing parking fees from CAD $4/h to nearly CAD $7.85/h and assigning 4.1% of parking spaces to truck deliveries would eliminate cruising and truck double-parking, resulting in a social surplus gain of over CAD $14,304/h/mile2. In a first-best allocation scenario where total parking spaces can also change, we found that increasing total parking spaces by 18%, having 3.5% truck delivery allocation, and reducing parking fees to CAD $2.47/h would eliminate cruising and double-parking while increasing social surplus by CAD $24,883/h/mile2. These model findings are along the same level of effect as demonstrated in the literature.}

abstract = {We address the problem of managing repair capacity and repaired component inventory in a service center. With modular products, the repair essentially involves identifying the faulty component in the product and replacing it with a repaired component or a new component, if repaired components are not available in stock. The faulty component is then repaired and used to service a future faulty product that arrives for repair. The problem is modeled as a queueing system with a limit on the queue length. The total cost function involves the steady-state probabilities and queue length of the queueing system. Using the properties of the cost function that we derive, we identify bounds on the decision variables, and use them in developing an algorithm to determine the optimal repair capacity and repaired component inventory. A computational study is carried out to investigate the impact of the various cost parameters on the optimal solution.}

abstract = {Communication about containers onboard a cargo carrier approaching a harbor with a hinterland operator who is to receive the containers usually reveals the total amount of goods (aggregate number of containers) to be transported inland upon unloading at the arrival dock. This communication is useful for the hinterland operator to plan and deploy its transport capacities. However, further transport of containers on the hinterland involve various transport modes at differing costs. For example, the delivery time requirement of a container dictates the most appropriate mode of inland transport, be it truck, rail, or barge, in decreasing order of speed, flexibility and cost, to move the container to the next destination. In general there may be several types of delivery time requirements and containers of each type is most economically moved inland in a corresponding transport mode. Trucking is usually used for containers that need urgent delivery and train or barge for not so urgent types. In order to efficiently plan the transport capacities for after-arrival conveyance of containers having multi-type delivery time requirements, not only should the aggregate number of containers, but also the number of containers of each type, be made available to the hinterland operator. We consider several information scenarios and in each scenario we solve a single-period capacity planning serving multi-type demands with product substitution. We then compare expected transport costs between information scenarios to evaluate the benefit of specific cargo information in improving the next-step transporting after containers are unloaded at the port of entry.}

A key objective was to refine the methodology for estimating crop residue harvesting for bioenergy use, while maintaining soil productivity and avoiding displacement of competing residue uses. At current conditions, the sustainable bioenergy potential from maize and wheat residues was estimated to be about 104 PJ. There is potential to increase the amount of crop residues to 238 PJ through measures such as no till cultivation and adopting improved cropping systems. These estimates were based on minimum residues requirements of 2 t ha−1 for soil erosion control and additional residue amounts to maintain 2% SOC level. At the farm gate, crop residues cost between 0.9 and 1.7 $ GJ−1. About 96% of these residues are available below 1.5 $ GJ−1. In the improved scenario, up to 85% of the biomass is below 1.3 $ GJ−1. For biomass deliveries at the conversion plant, about 36% is below 5 $ GJ−1 while in the optimised scenario, about 87% is delivered below 5$ GJ−1. Co-firing residues with coal results in lower cost of electricity compared to other renewables and significant GHG (CO2 eq) emissions reduction (up to 0.72 tons MWh−1). Establishing sustainable crop residue supply systems in South Africa could start by utilising the existing agricultural infrastructure to secure supply and develop a functional market. It would then be necessary to incentivise improvements across the value chain.}

Given the uncertainty of when patients are in need of prompt medical attention we consider these demand points to be uncertain. We consider various ways in which ground and helicopter ambulances can work together to make the whole process go faster. We develop a mathematical model that minimizes travel time and maximizes service level. We use a compromising programming method to solve this bi-objective mathematical model. For numerical experiments we apply our model to a case study in Lorestan, Iran, using geographical and population data, and the location of the actual hospital based in the capital of the province. Results show that low-accessibility locations are the main focus of the proposed problem and with mathematical modeling access to a hospital is vastly improved. We also found out that once the budget reaches a certain point which suffices for building certain ambulance bases more investments does not necessarily result in less travel time.}

It turns out that the real options trigger performs best, especially under conditions of high competitive intensity and freight rate volatility. A sensitivity analysis concludes that competitive intensity, alliance complexity cost, and freight rate volatility lead to alliance instability and that shorter lead times increase industry concentration.}

abstract = {Concerns about air quality and global warming have led to numerous initiatives to reduce emissions. In general, emissions are proportional to the amount of fuel consumed, and the amount of fuel consumed is a function of speed, distance, acceleration, and weight of the vehicle. In urban areas, vehicles must often travel at the speed of traffic, and congestion can impact this speed particularly at certain times of day. Further, for any given time of day, the observations of speeds on an arc can exhibit significant variability. Because of the nonlinearity of emissions curves, optimizing emissions in an urban area requires explicit consideration of the variability in the speed of traffic on arcs in the network. We introduce a shortest path algorithm that incorporates sampling to both account for variability in travel speeds and to estimate arrival time distributions at nodes on a path. We also suggest a method for transforming speed data into time-dependent emissions values thus converting the problem into a time-dependent, but deterministic shortest path problem. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches in reducing emissions relative to the use of minimum distance and time-dependent paths. In this paper, we also identify some of the challenges associated with using large data sets.}

The logic adopted by the developed traffic model is derived from a particular simulation scenario of electric charging: a freight distribution service operated using medium-sized vans. In this case, the CWD service is used to recover the state of charge of the FEV batteries to shortly start with further activities after arrival at the depot. The CWD system is assumed to be implemented in a multilane ring road with several intermediate on-ramp entrances, where the slowest lane is reserved for the dynamic charging of authorized electric vehicles. A specific traffic model is developed and implemented based on a mesoscopic approach, where energy requirements and charging opportunities affect driving and traffic behaviours. Overtaking manoeuvres as well as new entries in the CWD lane of vehicles that need to charge are modelled according to a cooperative driving system, which manages adequate time gaps between consecutive vehicles. Finally, a speed control strategy is simulated at a defined node to create an empty time-space slot in the CWD lane, by delaying the arriving vehicles. This simulated control, implemented to allow maintenance operations for CWD that may require clearing a charging zone for a short time slot, could also be applied to facilitate on-ramp merging manoeuvres.}

In terms of the consequences for supply chains, they will promote a much more dispersed and diversified, local and network based usage of goods than the current economy, which is comparatively linear, concentrated, long distance oriented and scale economy based. A gap in the literature is the assessment of the effects of these systems on freight transport flows. In our paper, we present a first attempt at estimating this impact using freight transport scenario building and quantitative modelling. In order to translate the main parameters that characterize these systems into factors determining freight transportation volumes, we develop a framework based on a typology of goods categories describing functional and spatial proximity between producers and consumers. In order to simulate changes in the economy, we develop scenarios for the shifting of goods from one category to another and, additionally, include internalization policies that should guide their realization. We calculate the impacts on freight flows using a new interregional transport model for France that includes distribution chains and produces estimates of external costs of transport. Our results show that circular and functional economies could lead to a 2–5% reduction of air pollutant emissions and up to a 14–26% reduction if combined with the internalization of external costs. The scenario with ongoing mass production for differentiated demand is found to lead to a 5% increase of environmental impacts compared to the baseline.}

It is distinctly different from general transportation scenarios where a vehicle is used to load and transport several cargos, namely “one-vehicle and multi-cargo transportation” (OVMC). The MVOC generates the difficulty in synchronizing several vehicles for transporting a cargo. A mathematical program that can be solved by existing mixed-integer linear program solver is formulated, by considering the synchronization constraint among the unit-load flat vehicles under the minimization of makespan. To improve the computation performance of the solution methods, a sequential insert algorithm is developed as the basic procedure for a greedy insert algorithm and as the decoding scheme of a proposed genetic algorithm. These three methods (the mathematical program, the greedy insert algorithm and the genetic algorithm) are compared by numerical studies considering the effects of instance scales and synchronization complexity on the optimality and computation performances. The genetic algorithm performed better for solving small- and medium-scale instances with lower complexity, and the greedy insert algorithm is very fast and suitable for solving large-scale and complex instances.}

abstract = {Several global challenges exist that force manufacturing organizations to reduce the environmental impact of their products. Nowadays, the most common practices of products’ end-of-life stage are landfilling and recycling. However, there are several other practices for products’ end-of-life management that support reduction of environmental impact. One such option is remanufacturing which is a product-recovery option that gives the opportunity to produce new products by using products that have already reached their end-of-life stage. In the process, all modules and components are disassembled, and the used parts – recovered. Depending on the product remanufactured, the process helps reducing energy consumption by 85%, avoiding up to 60% of emissions and saving up to 85% of raw materials, thus reducing the environmental impact considerably. Still, many barriers exist that prevent manufacturing enterprises from implementing the remanufacturing process. To assist enterprises, a decision support tool based on system dynamics modeling has been developed. The paper presents the decision support tool, and shows how the decision of implementing the remanufacturing process in an enterprise changes its performance with respect to environmental and economic aspects.}

This work focuses on optimizing inventory and delivery strategies. While in traditional brick-and-mortar operations customers select products based on quality and expiration date, in e-groceries, primarily the provider performs this selection, impacting both food waste and customer satisfaction. Shipping goods close to expiration reduces spoilage, however, customers mainly prefer products with a long-lasting shelf life. To support sustainable provision of food, this work develops a decision support system incorporating an agent-based simulation and dynamic routing procedures to investigate e-grocery inventory and delivery operations. Food quality functions for 48 produces are incorporated to model food decay. Based on test scenarios motivated by an e-grocery provider operating in Vienna, Austria, managerial implications are provided and discussed. Results highlight major trade-offs between minimizing travel distances and food waste as well as the high importance of the selected inventory strategy. Furthermore, insights on the impact of the number of operated stores and individual store utilization are given.}

abstract = {Due to uncertainty in supply chains and carrier networks stretched thin by demand, it is sometimes necessary for shippers to procure capacity for shipments on the transportation spot market. The transportation spot market is a mechanism by which unfulfilled and urgent demand is satisfied. Shipments are tendered one at a time on a load-by-load basis. Because of the often severe shortage of spot market capacity and its relatively high and volatile prices, shippers must actively as opposed to passively seek carrier capacity. Often, they turn to third parties. This research considers third party brokers (3PL, or non-asset carriers) operating in the spot market. On behalf of shippers, these brokers take responsibility for shipments and secure capacity for them. The paper proposes a behaviourally-based conceptual framework that uses 3PL broker data to improve the search for capacity on the spot market. It seeks to improve the effectiveness of the search process by combining (1) broker data on the availability of carrier capacity, (2) a priori information on a particular carrier’s likely response to various prices to service a load (the reservation price), and (3) the ability to source multiple loads simultaneously (bundling). These components are incorporated into a framework that enables brokers to better prioritize the carriers they contact, thereby improving outcomes in terms of lower carrier costs and reduced search effort.}

Delivery companies are affected by emission-sensitive traffic management systems. These systems are installed in cities to react instantly to emission hot-spots through adapting traffic light programs at intersections. This results in a change of the travel times for the delivery vehicle. In this paper, we model the problem in a dynamic vehicle routing problem with stochastic transition of deterministic travel time matrices. To solve this problem, we apply approximate value iteration, a method of approximate dynamic programming, to anticipate future travel time matrix changes in dynamic routing decisions. We vary the approach in the level of information about the state of the traffic management system. This allows to distinguish the required information for the routing decisions. Further, we compare the dynamic and anticipatory routing policies with a static a priori routing. Computational studies show an improved tour duration of routing with traffic management information over the a priori routing by up to 6.5%. We further show that an efficient representation of the traffic management system status in the approximate value iteration approach is mandatory to achieve sufficient anticipation.}

The Multi-Mode Resource-Constrained Cross-Dock Scheduling Problem (MRCDSP) approach minimizes material flow and schedules inbound and outbound containers to dock-doors such that the total processing time is minimized subject to the resource constraints at the cross-dock. While container scheduling and resource allocation problems at cross-dock facilities have been studied previously in isolation, our work is the first to consider a complete view of cross-dock operations providing optimal container to dock-door allocation, and a makespan minimizing schedule of containers to the cross-dock. We present a comprehensive framework that includes identification of container clusters to reduce the problem size, a container-to-dock-door assignment algorithm, and a container clusters scheduling model that is solvable for practically sized problems. In a comparative numeric study based on data simulating a cross-dock facility, our approach is shown to outperform current practice, reducing the average time required for processing a set of containers by 37% and reducing the weighted-distance material traveled within the cross-dock by 45%.}

abstract = {Due to rigorous environmental legislations and competitive economics worldwide, a growing number of companies are devoted to recovering and remanufacturing used products. Consequently, over the past few decades, the management of manufacturing/remanufacturing systems has been receiving increasing attention from researchers and companies leaders. Most of the existing research papers in the literature considered that remanufactured products have the same quality and price as new ones. However, in practice, the market perceives new items as higher quality products rather than remanufactured items. This paper aims to bridge the gap in research on manufacturing/remanufacturing supply chain, by investigating an optimal storage and manufacturing/remanufacturing planning, while taking into consideration the difference between new and remanufactured items, random machine failures, carbon constraints and distinct random customer demands for both items types. Furthermore, to make our system more realistic, it is assumed that the return rate of used items depends on the sales in the past periods, machine repair time is stochastic and set-up time period is not negligible. In this study, two models are developed, considering carbon emissions or not, to determine the optimal values of the manufacturing/remanufacturing period lengths and serviceable stock capacities of new and remanufactured items. Numerical results are provided to illustrate the impact of set-up cost, percentage of returned used items, machine availability, carbon cap and carbon trading price on the optimal storage and production planning. Moreover, the influences of carbon cap, carbon trading price and percentage of returned used items on carbon emissions have been analyzed. The results reveal that set-up cost, percentage of returned used items and machine availability have significant impact on storage and production planning of new and remanufactured items. In addition, the results indicate that a lower carbon cap and/or a high carbon trading price, induce the producer to collect and remanufacture used items and curb carbon emissions.}

Although these health risks could be substantial, there is little previous work quantifying detailed emission profiles at POEs. Using the Mariposa POE in Nogales, Arizona as a case study, light-duty and heavy-duty vehicle emissions were analyzed with the objective of identifying effective emission reduction strategies such as inspection streamlining, physical infrastructure improvements, and fuel switching. Historical traffic information as well as field data were used to establish a simulation model of vehicle movement in VISSIM. Four simulation scenarios with varied congestion levels were considered to represent real-world seasonal changes in traffic volume. Four additional simulations captured varying levels of expedited processing procedures. The VISSIM output was analyzed using the EPA’s MOVES emission simulation software for conventional air pollutants. For the highest congestion scenario, which includes a 200% increase in vehicle volume, total emissions increase by around 460% for PM2.5 and NOx, and 540% for CO, SO2, GHGs, and NMHC over uncongested conditions for a two-hour period. Expedited processing and queue reduction can reduce emissions in this highest congestion scenario by as much as 16% for PM2.5, 18% for NOx, 20% for NMHC, 7% for SO2 and 15% for GHGs and CO. Other potential mitigation strategies examined include fleet upgrades, fuel switching, and fuel upgrades. Adoption of some or all of these changes would not only reduce emissions at the Mariposa POE, but would have air-quality benefits for nearby populations in both the US and Mexico. Fleet-level changes could have far-reaching improvements in air quality on both sides of the border.}

This paper presents a novel distribution model of digital products inspired by lean supply chain principles called CloudChain, which has been designed to support the information management during digital product lifecycle. This model enables connected networks of customers, partners and organizations to conduct the stages of digital product lifecycle as value chains. Virtual distribution channels are created over cloud resources for applications of organizations to deliver digital products to applications of partners through a seamless information flow. A configurable packing and logistic service was developed to ensure confidentiality and privacy in the product delivery by using encrypted packs. A chain management architecture enables organizations to keep tighter control over their value chains, distribution channels and digital products. CloudChain software instances were integrated to an information management system of a space agency. In an experimental evaluation CloudChain prototype was evaluated in a private cloud where the feasibility of applying supply chain principles to the delivery of digital products in terms of efficiency, flexibility and security was revealed.}

Disruptions at hubs result in excessive transportation costs and economic losses as customers (demand) initially served by these facilities must now be served by other hubs. In this study, we first present a novel mathematical model that builds hub-and-spoke systems under the risk of hub disruption. In developing the model, we assume that once a hub stops normal operations, the entire demand initially served by this hub is handled by a backup facility. The objective function of the model minimizes the weighted sum of transportation cost in regular situation and the expected transportation cost following a hub failure. We adopted a linearization for the model and present an efficient evolutionary approach with specifically designed operators. We solved a number of small problem instances from the literature using CPLEX for our enhanced mathematical model. The obtained results are also used as a platform for assessing the performance of our proposed meta-heuristic which is then tested on large instances with promising results. We further study and provide results for the relaxed problem in which demand points affected by disruption are allowed to be reallocated to any of the operational hubs in the network.}

This work further addresses this problem by particle swarm optimization with bad experience to avoid bad solutions, in which a novel solution representation is designed for simultaneously handling both order batching and picker routing. The idea of the design is to transform the warehouse floorplan into a grid, in which virtual order center and batch center are defined to represent symbolic positions of orders and batches of the solution, respectively. By calculating the distance between the two centers, similar orders are categorized as the same batch. Additionally, theoretical analysis of convergence and stability of the proposed approach is also derived. Performance of this approach is evaluated via comprehensive experimental analysis and a case study.}

This paper addresses this problem and suggests using a procedure based on role-playing games (RPGs). A first application is described with the intent of providing a preliminary contribution to validate an ABM trying to mimic stakeholders’ interaction in a multi-level decision-making process in the context of urban freight transport policy-making. The aim is twofold: (1) understand if the structure of the model and the opinion dynamics envisioned are consistent with a real negotiation process, (2) verify if the results derived from the ABM effort are in line with those derived from a real-life experiment. Results of the first preliminary experiment show that the model seems capable of reproducing real-world processes and confirm that well-thought-out RPGs can contribute to validating ABMs.}

This coordination involves extensive communication about specific needs, resource availability, optimal sizes and packaging of goods, and location and timing of deliveries. Faster, more accurate communication within the disaster response network translates to more effective response at the disaster site. This article presents a modeling project that assessed the effects of distinct communication media on response times within a centralized network. In the United States, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) provides support and coordination among numerous responding agencies. An initial agent-based simulation model incorporated data from participant interviews and FEMA documentation about communication processes among response organization representatives. This model tracked effects of meetings, meeting scheduling, and bulletins on time required to complete the processing of requests. Following a second round of interviews and detailed observations during a national disaster exercise, we built a second agent-based simulation model that varied usage of email, phone, and face-to-face communications alongside a centralized information system and tracked the processing of anticipated, standard, and non-standard resource requests. Results show significant effects of different combinations of communication media on response times. Recommendations based on the study include: resist the temptation to schedule more than one meeting per day; use bulletins to disseminate information updates; supplement the centralized information system with direct interpersonal communication media such as email; and for unusual or difficult requests enable representatives to have in-person conversations or the closest alternative such as video teleconferencing with screen-sharing.}

The international trade literature has given little attention to this issue. The aim of this paper is to analyze transport-mode competition in inter-provincial deliveries within Spain. To this end, we use a detailed dataset with fifty inter-provincial, industry-specific flows by four transport modes (road, train, ship and aircraft). We then feed this dataset into various specifications of a gravity model that incorporates cross-sectional dependence attributable to unobservable factors directly associated with the presence of transport-mode competition schemes. In considering alternative distance segments, we also test for competition effects between road and the other three modes.}

However, such systems bring greater managerial complexity, and thus the determination of an appropriate operation strategy to set the recycling ratio of the old product and allocate the capacities of production to the new and remanufactured products is an important issue. This study mainly focuses on a hybrid production system in which the determination of the optimal operation strategy is based on the consideration of the related costs, the uncertainty about recycling, the demand substitution, the capacity limitation, and the component durability. Moreover, the competition between new and remanufactured products is also considered to construct the proposed model, with the aim of maximizing the profit of the manufacturer. The mathematical model are designed from several possible scenarios to estimate the expected revenue and related costs of the hybrid production system. A Hessian matrix and multivariate optimization methods are used to examine and obtain the optimal solution of the mathematical model. The impacts of related parameters are investigated by utilizing sensitivity analysis, and the results of this can give insights to the related production managers.}

This is partly due to the diversity of commodities transported, shipment units, vehicle types used, stakeholders’ objectives (e.g. suppliers, carriers, receivers), and to the limited availability of data. Thus, existing modelling efforts require several assumptions yet have limited behavioral foundations and minimal interaction between agents. This paper proposes a new agent-based modelling framework, which considers the heterogeneity of urban freight agents and their interactions. Agents include establishments (suppliers, carriers, and receivers) and freight vehicle drivers. Agents’ decisions are structured in three temporal resolutions: strategic, tactical, and operational. A single set of agents is represented throughout all modelling levels ensuring a consistent and sequential flow of information. At the strategic level, establishments’ characteristics and strategic decisions are modelled. These include location choices, fleet constitution, annual production/consumption of commodities, and establishment-to-establishment commodity flows. At the tactical level, shipments are assigned to carriers, who in turn plan their operations in terms of vehicle-driver-route assignments. Finally, at the operational level, the interactions between daily operational demands and transportation network supply are simulated. The supply representation has two different resolution levels (micro or meso) allowing for either detailed or computational efficient simulation. The simulation platform is distinct from previous works, as it explicitly considers planning horizons, replicates agent decision makings/interactions and involves a structure that allows for the propagation of influences bottom-up (e.g., prior simulation travel times on future route choice). The paper describes the simulation platform, constituent models, and illustrates its capabilities using an application of the modelling framework to the city of Singapore.}

Utilizing real-word data, tradeoffs and comparative advantages of UAVs are discussed. Breakeven points for operational emissions are obtained and the results clearly indicate that UAVs are more CO2e efficient, for small payloads, than conventional diesel vans in a per-distance basis. Drastically different results are obtained when customers can be grouped in a delivery route. UAV deliveries are not more CO2e efficient than tricycle or electric van delivery services if a few customers can be grouped in a route. Vehicle phase CO2e emissions for UAVs are significant and must be taken into account. Ground vehicles are more efficient when comparing vehicles production and disposal emissions per delivery.}

Currently there lies a knowledge gap in studies on the spatial prediction and mapping of determinant parameters (e.g. temperature) for the shelf life of perishable products. Through the viewpoint of different refrigeration failure scenarios this paper investigates and compares three data estimation tools (artificial neural networks, Kriging and capacitive heat transfer) for improved food safety. Results indicate that using these techniques makes it possible to reduce the number of sensors (through estimation of temperature distribution) within an industrial scale fully loaded strawberry-shipping container, thus reducing the overall commercial cost. Using a set of eight source sensors, an average error of 0.1 °C was achieved, which represents an improvement of 97.14% in regards to the absolute error between the ambient and product temperatures. Even when using only a single container sensor as a source for prediction, with an average error of 1.49 °C there still was an improvement of 62% with regards to the same baseline. This paper demonstrates that the adoption of these technologies not only presents significant industrial value-added potential but also the data obtained can further improve cold chain strategies and reduce product losses through more accurate shelf life calculations.}

The truck scheduling problem has been studied by many authors, but mainly in a deterministic case. And yet, many uncertainties can arise in the process: if a truck is delayed, or the process times change, does the truck schedule remain feasible and stable? This article proposes robust models for the truck scheduling model with time windows. The reformulations of the original model are based on classical techniques in robust optimization (minimax and minimization of the expected regret) but also on techniques from robust project scheduling (resource redundancy and time redundancy). The numerical study carried out to compare the nine different models shows that the methods based on resource redundancy give good results in the cross-docking case. Minimizing the average number of trucks docked at a given door is a good way to ensure robustness in the schedule, but it also increases storage.}

abstract = {The integration of distribution and routing constitutes the Inventory Routing Problem (IRP), an important aspect of Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) systems. IRP involves decisions on timing of deliveries, sizes of shipments and routing of vehicles. In the context of supply chain collaboration, the scope of IRP expands to include replenishments at the depot. This paper studies an IRP involving multiple products from different suppliers, a central depot (CD) and a set of warehouses. We develop an integrated Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model to determine the optimal replenishments from suppliers to the CD as well as the routing schedules of vehicles from CD to the multiple warehouses over the defined time horizon. We propose an extended three-phase heuristic called CARE (Clustering, Allocation, Routing -Extended). In the heuristic, the replenishment schedules, from suppliers to the CD (for multiple products in the defined time horizon), is solved using a dynamic programming (DP) model. The routing schedules of vehicles from CD to the multiple warehouses is then modeled and solved as a capacitated IRP (CIRP) problem. With the replenishment schedules as an input from the DP model, the CIRP is solved in three-phases: Cluster the nodes, Allocate to these nodes and Route delivery vehicles through clusters of nodes. Three variants of heuristics are proposed based on the changes to the routing phase – CARE1, CARE2, and CARE3. Computational results for a broad range of test instances yield promising results and show usefulness of the solution approaches. Particularly, the proposed heuristics outperformed CPLEX upper bounds for larger problems with lesser computational effort. The average improvement obtained by the heuristics over CPLEX upper bounds for 15 and 20 warehouse problems, respectively, are: CARE1 – 0.94% and 3.6%, CARE2 – 1.36% and 4.26%, CARE3 – 2.87% and 6.08%. We also show that the results from the proposed heuristic are statistically better than the CPLEX upper bounds. The proposed approaches can easily be implemented into existing VMI systems.}

The objective is to minimize the total cost rate consisting of fleet costs, distribution costs from the depot to the customers and inventory holding costs at the customers. A solution is built in two phases: designing routes and composing the fleet. When designing vehicle routes in the first phase, the route cycle times are chosen such that the distribution and inventory holding costs are minimized. When assigning routes to vehicles in the second phase, the routes remain unchanged, but their cycle times can be adjusted to minimize the required number of vehicles. The building blocks of this two-phase solution approach are embedded in a metaheuristic framework. Computational experiments show that the resulting solution framework outperforms existing solution approaches.}

Port-to-port movements comprise the majority of events and about 30% of activity relates to movements offshore. Port Fourchon, Venice, New Orleans, Sabine-Neches, and Lake Charles were the most active ports during the period.

The model is designed as a three-stage complete information game: in the first stage, the firms simultaneously invest in their fleet; in the second stage, they individually design their services and solve the route assignment problem with respect to the transport demand they expect to serve, given the fleet determined in the first stage; in the final stage, the firms compete in terms of freight rates on each origin–destination movement. The game is solved by backward induction. Numerical solutions are provided to characterize the equilibria of the game.}

Dual shuttle cranes have received minimal academic attention and thus continue to pose new problems that must be solved. The miniload AS/RS problem is addressed by decomposing it into a location assignment and sequencing problem. Different heuristic strategies are introduced for making the assignments, while a general mathematical model and efficient branch and bound procedure are proposed for optimizing the sequence. Additionally, a fast metaheuristic capable of solving larger instances is also developed. A set of real-world based benchmarks with varying characteristics is generated to evaluate the proposed methods. Very small instances prove the only for which optimal sequences are found in reasonable calculation time. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the heuristic decomposition method.}

Resulting from our analysis, this paper gives advice on the improvement of the environment and enhance in social welfare. Tested through the data we collected, this study is practical in both its theory and its applicability.}

abstract = {Due to comfort, convenience, and flexibility, taxis have become increasingly more prevalent in China, especially in large cities. However, many violations and road crashes that occurred frequently were related to taxi drivers. This study aimed to investigate differences in driving performance between taxi drivers and non-professional drivers from the perspectives of red-light running violation and potential crash involvement based on a driving simulation experiment. Two typical scenarios were established in a driving simulator, which includes the red-light running violation scenario and the crash avoidance scenario. There were 49 participants, including 23 taxi drivers (14 males and 9 females) and 26 non-professional drivers (13 males and 13 females) recruited for this experiment. The driving simulation experiment results indicated that non-professional drivers paid more attention to red-light running violations in comparison to taxi drivers who had a higher probability of red-light running violation. Furthermore, it was found that taxi drivers were more inclined to turn the steering wheel in an attempt to avoid a potential collision and non-professional drivers had more abrupt deceleration behaviors when facing a potential crash. Moreover, the experiment results showed that taxi drivers had a smaller crash rate compared to non-professional drivers and had a better performance in terms of crash avoidance at the intersection.}

The goal is to minimize the total time to deliver relief goods to satisfy the demand, considering uncertain data and of the risk-averse attitude of the decision-maker. A numerical example based on the large-scale earthquake that occurred on September 21, 1999 in Taiwan is presented to demonstrate the system.}

The right engagement approach may require knowledge of agents’ preferences across multi-echelon supply chains to align private sector value creation with humanitarian outcomes. We propose a multi-attribute value analysis (MAVA) framework to elucidate such preferences. We formalize this approach and apply it in collaboration with a HO pilot aiming to facilitate better private sector availability of malaria rapid diagnostic tests in Uganda. We demonstrate how HOs could use criteria weights and value functions from MAVA for project evaluation; in the process, we reveal business model insights for importers, distributors, and retailers in the pilot. We also show how MAVA facilitates the impact assessment of hypothetical options (i.e., combinations of products, services, and subsidies) to guide HO resource deployment. This paper offers the first attempt, to our knowledge, to develop quantitative measures for economic and non-economic objectives involving all agents in a multi-echelon supply chain, either humanitarian or commercial. We hope that this initial step stimulates further research to validate results and develop the framework proposed.}

The objectives are to minimize both total cost and time for transportation. Some particular models for (a) substitutable items (b) damageable items and (c) safety Factor have been derived. To convert bi-criteria solid transportation problem into a single objective problem, three different techniques (i) Fuzzy interactive satisficing method, (ii) Global Criterion Method and (iii) Convex Combination Method are used. Then the reduced single objective problem is solved by a non-linear optimization technique – Generalized reduced gradient method using LINGO-14.0. The models are illustrated through some numerical examples and optimal results are presented in tabular forms.}

This study is a first attempt to empirically analyze and describe the effects of returns policies on consumer behavior and the moderating effects of the policies on profitability. The method involves analyzing the transactional data of a Swedish online fashion retailer. The results of the regression analyses show that with a lenient returns policy, repeat customers generate a significantly higher contribution per order, while returners and customers who enjoy free returns generate a significantly lower contribution per order. In addition, returners and repeat customers generate a significantly higher total contribution, while customers who enjoy free returns generate a significantly lower total contribution. Hence, returns policies that are free of charge do not necessarily benefit retailers in terms of long-term profitability. From a managerial perspective, the results provide guidance on how to address the recent changes in European consumer legislation.}

We further find that an increased level of competition will lead to a higher consumer surplus if the respective consumer goodwill of donation is sufficiently small.}

abstract = {Container terminals are facing great challenges in order to meet the shipping industry’s requirements. An important fact within the industry is the increasing vessel sizes. Actually, within the last decade the ship size in the Asia–Europe trade has effectively doubled. However, port productivity has not doubled along with the larger vessel sizes. This has led to increased vessel turn around times at ports which indeed is a severe problem. In order to meet the industry targets a game-changer in container handling is required. Indented berth structure is one important opportunity to handle this issue. This novel berth structure requires new models and solution techniques for scheduling the quay cranes serving the indented berth. Accordingly, in this paper, we approach the quay crane scheduling problem at an indented berth structure. We focus on the challenges and constraints related to the novel architecture. We model the quay crane scheduling problem under the special structure and develop a solution technique based on branch-and-price. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.}

abstract = {The collection of sawmill residues is an important logistic activity for the pulp and paper industry, which uses the biomass as a source of energy. We study a vehicle routing problem for a network composed of a single depot and several sawmills. The sawmills serve as potential suppliers of biomass residues to the depot, which in turn processes and distributes the residues to the pulp and paper mills. This problem consists of identifying the best daily routing schedule for a fixed number of trucks. The objective is to maximize the ratio of energy returned on energy invested, while satisfying a minimum daily amount of dried biomass residues. There are several random components in the problem, including the availability and moisture content of the biomass residues. We use a combination of scenario analysis and heuristics to solve this stochastic vehicle routing problem. A performance comparison of the proposed method reveals an estimated daily energy savings of 6 GJ over the benchmark method.}

abstract = {In this paper, a new variant of the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (PDPTW) named the Fleet Size and Mix Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows (FSMPDPTW) is addressed. This work is motivated by fleet sizing for a daily route planning arising at a Hospital center. In fact, a fleet of heterogeneous rented vehicles is used every day to pick up goods to locations and to deliver it to other locations. The heterogeneous aspect of the fleet is in term of capacity, fixed cost and fuel mileage. The objective function is the minimization of the total fixed cost of vehicles used and the minimization of the total routing cost. A set partitioning model is proposed to model the problem, and an efficient column-generation algorithm is used to solve it. In order to test our method, we propose a new set of benchmarks based on Li and Lim’s benchmark (altered Solomon’s benchmark) for demands and from Lui and Shen’s benchmark for types of vehicles. In the propounded column-generation algorithm, the pricing problem is divided in sub-problems such that each vehicle type have its own pricing problem. A mixed integer linear program is proposed to model and solve the pricing sub-problems. Regret heuristics are proposed to speed-up the resolution of pricing sub-problems. Computational experiments are done on 56 (with up to 100 customers) new proposed instances.}

The LLRP is customer oriented by pursuing minimization of the latency instead of minimization of the length of routes. One of the main applications of this problem is the distribution of supplies to affected areas in post-disaster relief activities. It is also relevant in customer-oriented supply chain where latency at demand locations plays a significant role in the satisfaction of the customers. The problem is formulated mathematically and two heuristics, the Memetic Algorithm (MA) and the Recursive Granular Algorithm (RGA), are proposed. An extensive experimental study shows that both algorithms are able to produce promising results in reasonable time.}

First, the deterministic problem is formulated as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP). A sensitivity analysis is carried out in order to investigate the impact of variations of the main input parameters such as customer return rates, revenues, costs as well as the proportions of returns assigned to each recovery option, on the network structure and the company profit. Then, a stochastic version of the model is developed to account for the high uncertainties faced by companies. A scenario-based approach is used to model the uncertainties of return rates, revenues, costs and the quality of returns. The computational results show that the solution of the stochastic problem is stable over different replications and that the benefit from using stochastic modeling increases when the penalty over non collected returns increases.}
