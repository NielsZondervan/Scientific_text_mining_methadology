abstract = {Baltic Sea Region is one of the prime cruise destination. In 2017 over 5 million passengers visited the Baltic ports onboard cruise vessels. The number of calls amounted to 2497. The estimates for 2018 shows further increase by 8,4% in passengers and 6,4 % in calls. Cruise business requires dedicated services for ships and travellers. Handling of cruise vessels and their passengers generate a number of logistic challenges related to the water and land sides. Vessels require specific areas and facilities from waterside and ports services such as pilotage, tugs, bunkering, waste management, shipchandler, etc. From landside cruise passengers need to prepare dedicated tourist offer, effective transfer from the terminals, as well as areas for different groups and facilities to embark and disembark. Handling both large and small cruisers create challenges for harbours and cities that are the destinations for cruise lines. The purpose of the paper is to research the areas of services dedicated for cruise industry from waterside and landside in context of ecological requirements and sustainable logistics in ports cities being ports of calls and ports of turnaround of cruisers. Further the investigation will focus on services provided in Baltic harbours for large and small segments. On the base of available data, the services will be assessed in terms of legal requirements and service quality.}

The intelligent use of sensing and information technologies has the potential to start a new food revolution in which limited resources such as water, capital, transportation capacity and labor could be optimally exploited so that fresh food, in particular fruits and vegetables, get to the consumer with minimal or no food waste. One of the keys for making this vision a reality is transforming the data collected as these products traverse the supply chain into effective and efficient supply chain decisions. This transformation relies on that the underlying decision systems that take advantage of this data exist or can be developed. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the state of the art and challenges and opportunities emerging from the integration of sensing data and information into decision support systems for supply chain of fresh fruits and vegetables.}

To shed light on the cognitive aspects of forklift operators, this paper aspires to quantify the learning process for n = 5 forklift operators and mental fatigue effects for another n = 5 operators in a retail warehouse for cooled and perishable items. Our results indicate that learning, as well as fatigue effects, can be observed in this field of operations and are measurable through a multivariable parametric approach.}

abstract = {A problem faced by some Logistic Support Organisations (LSOs) is that of forecasting the demand for spare parts, corresponding to equipment failures within the system. Here we are particularly concerned with a final phase of operations and the opportunity to place only a single order to cover demand during this phase. The problem is further complicated when the service logistics context can change during this final phase, e.g. as the number of systems supported or the LSO's resources change. Such a problem is typical of the final phase of many military operations. The LSO operates the recovery and repair loop for the equipment in question. By developing a simulation of the LSO, we can generate synthetic operational data regarding equipment breakdowns, etc. We then split that data into a training set and a test set in order to compare several approaches to forecasting demand in the final operational phase. We are particularly interested in the application of Bayesian network models for this type of forecasting since these offer a way of combining hard observational data with subjective expert opinion. Different LSO configurations were simulated to create a test dataset and the simulation results were compared with the various forecasts. The BN that learned from training data performed best, followed by a hybrid BN design combining expert elicitation and machine learning, and then a logistic regression model. An expert-adjusted exponential smoothing model was the poorest performer and these differences were statistically significant. The paper concludes with a discussion of the results, some implications for practice and suggestions for future work.}

This model allows establishing the level of sustainability (high, medium, or low). Several classification algorithms were trained, finding that the support vector machines algorithm is the most accurate, with 98% accuracy for the data set used.

Eight experts from different organizations in maritime logistics and seaport operations were interviewed in a qualitative multiple-case research design. The interviews were evaluated by qualitative-quantitative content analysis with MAXQDA software. Automated twistlock handling systems are hardly implemented, although they represent the missing link between other container handling technology in the automated container transport. The study reveals that most implementation barriers consist of technological issues, followed by economic and strategic barriers. The study identifies implementation strategies and their key success and shows that safety improvements and cost reductions are major benefits of this automation. An innovation framework for this field of automation is conceptualized as scientific contribution. Practical implications include recommendations for relevant stakeholders in container logistics.}

However, the classic queue-pricing literature emphasizes the former and ignores the latter. In order to bridge the gap between research and practice, this study addresses the interactive impact of price, delivery time, and delivery-reliability level on the equilibrium behaviour of rational customers and the optimal decisions of a revenue-maximizing service provider. We assume that the customers’ sensitivity to the delivery-reliability level is characterized by an increasing concave service value function. We model the operations of the service provider as an M/M/1 queue. Two cases are investigated: homogeneous customers and heterogeneous customers. For the homogeneous customers case, we analytically characterize the service provider’s optimal price, delivery time, and delivery-reliability level decisions. We show how the service provider’s decisions on whether to provide faster or more reliable service are affected when different problem parameters are subject to variation. For instance, when customers become more sensitive to the delivery-reliability level, the service provider increases the delivery-reliability level at the expense of a longer delivery time. However, the optimal price may either increase or decrease depending on a benchmark value for the delivery-reliability level. For the heterogeneous customers case, our results suggest that when the potential arrival rate is sufficiently high, the service provider always benefits from markets with higher levels of customer heterogeneity.}

abstract = {City logistics and goods movement using road freight is an outcome of the economic activities that sustain urban life. However, they produce negative externalities like traffic congestion and pollution. There are key areas within cities that are largely affected by logistics activities, such as commercial centres and retail districts. These locations attract many freight vehicles attempting to fulfil deliveries, often with limited parking supply. This results in long queues of delivery trucks waiting for parking spaces or illegal kerbside parking. Therefore, urban planners and decision-makers are motivated to initiate policies that can mitigate these impacts. Urban freight management policies like delivery time or truck size restrictions, and Urban Consolidation Centres (UCC) have been proposed as potential solutions. A UCC is a facility that allows deliveries to be consolidated before entering a busy commercial area. The focus of this study is to offer a theoretical framework for predicting the impact of a UCC on the number of freight trips attracted to a retail district in any city. A mathematical model is developed and used to analyse two possible policy cases concerning the location of a UCC: one where the UCC is located within the retail district, and another where the UCC is located outside the retail district. This model is subsequently applied to examine a retail district in Singapore using real-world data. The critical level of participation in a UCC scheme required for the retail district to experience fewer freight trips is characterised. The results show a diminishing marginal benefit associated with achieving greater consolidation by operating the UCC. This contribution offers a theoretical explanation for the traffic impacts of urban freight consolidation, and aids with the development an ex-ante evaluation of a UCC. The model may be readily applied to any city considering this initiative, by adjusting the model parameters for local conditions.}

However, most of the literature focuses on the homogeneity of CLSC products and on the dyadic structure of the CLSC mostly involving single manufacturers, distributors, or retailers. Very seldom do we find studies conducted in the analysis of the CLSC with network structure, in which multiple agents compete and coordinate. Inspired by some recent business cases, we develop a coupled CLSC network model dealing with heterogeneous products facing different market demands. The end-of-life product from the forward supply chain is collected and recycled so that raw material can be extracted and used as an input for the reverse supply chain which produces another type of product. Moreover, in each supply chain, raw material suppliers, manufactures, and retailers have to compete and coordinate to satisfy the demand while the forward and reverse supply chains have to work together to materialize the supply chain “loop”. Additionally, a CLSC network equilibrium is defined and studied by using variational inequalities. The properties of the equilibrium solution are also examined. By applying the modified projection method, we analyze a series of numerical examples. Based on the proposed model, the managerial insights are provided to show how the market size of the forward chain, raw material costs in both forward chain and reverse chain impact the demand, equilibrium prices and total profits of the CLSC network. It is also worth noting that the consumers' environmental awareness is critical to make the coupled CLSC networks viable.}

abstract = {Due to its location on the world dry belt, Iran is known as a disaster-prone country. Regarding such a problem, planning for relief operations in disaster situations seems significant and undeniable. The literature on disaster management has mostly defined their problems in a single-level framework, ignoring the bi-level aspect of such problems in both preparedness and response phases. However, in the context of disaster in the real world, there is normally more than one decision-maker that each of them may have their own objective. In this study, a bi-level multi-objective programming approach is extended to design a pre-positioning and distribution network under disastrous conditions considering both preparedness and response phases. The extended framework takes into account simultaneous planning for the distribution of drug, blood and relief items among disaster victims, and transferring the injured to hospital in order to diminish the adverse effects of potential disasters in the response phase. Additionally, to determine suitable candidate places for locating relief centers in the preparedness phase, a modified version of data envelopment analysis model is utilized, something that is not frequently done for facility location planning in the disaster management field. On the other hand, to solve the bi-level multi-objective programming problem with decision-makers at the upper level (the affected country) and the lower level (the international organization), a fuzzy goal programming algorithm is proposed. Furthermore, a consolidated method with respect to a novel fuzzy measure is developed to keep the considered network safe against the inherent uncertainty. Finally, the extended framework is utilized to solve a case study in Kermanshah, the province of Iran.}

At the same time, even during lockdowns, many countries did practically no attempt to restrict road traffic, fearing that this would freeze the shipping of vital goods, primarily food. As a result, shipping by road transport has only been impacted by the drop in consumer demand. Nonetheless, shipping companies’ operations have undergone drastic changes due to the quarantine. Sending some of the personnel to work from home has been one of these changes. On the one hand, this has exacerbated certain risks. On the other hand, when personnel works from home, this helps reduce spending and may even be considered as a way of enforcing the lean transportation principle. The insights gained from remote controllers’ efforts to keep road shipping safe and reliable during the COVID-19 pandemic may find successful uses as a step towards greater shipping efficiency, not only in emergencies, but under other circumstances as well. In this paper, we consider the capabilities of a virtual machine-based architecture for a road shipping control system. We also elaborate on the practical results of deploying such an architecture. Our study proves that our concept of a geographically dispersed shipping company that uses a Virtual Desktop Infrastructure and Process Mining has the means to ensure productive remote controller operation, including operation through low-bandwidth Internet channels, and guarantees the integrity and confidentiality of the relevant business information.}

These congestions cause many problems such as pollution (gasoil, Carbon, etc.), noise, waste of time. Indeed, cities like Paris, Hamburg, Milan, and “Grand Paris Sud” conurbation are thinking about a sustainable alternative solution to road transportation. Then, a research based on co-creation methodology integrating all stakeholders (local authorities, companies, citizens) for elaborating an alternative solution to road transportation has been defined. This paper presents the architecture and the development of a decision aided tool for simulating and optimizing alternative solutions to road transportation}

abstract = {In a hospital, surgical supplies can be stored in multiple locations, each of which has limited space and different associated costs. The locations include central storage, where items are retrieved to build a cart of supplies for each procedure; sterile storage adjacent to the operating rooms; and within the operating rooms themselves. In practice, the decision on allocating items to these locations is often based on the staff’s experience, rather than through optimization methods. In this research, we have identified the costs associated with each location to determine where each item should be stored and in what quantities. These costs include the cost of building the case cart, the cost of returning unused items to storage, the cost of picking items during a procedure, the cost of restocking and the cost of reviewing items to determine what needs to be replenished. Since the number of supplies required to perform a procedure is uncertain, we have developed a robust stochastic mixed-integer programming model to make the inventory allocation decision. The model also enables a hospital to assess the potential cost saving from optimization of the preference cards, which are used by surgeons to specify the requested supplies available on the case carts. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated through a case study. Three alternatives to the current configuration of the system are presented and reduction of inventory expenditure within each alternative is discussed. Finally, sensitivity analyses are performed to determine which cost parameters contribute to the model more significantly and how the model behaves against different levels of risk coefficient.}

More than half of the world's population lives in cities, or urban areas, and this share will continue to grow. Rapid urban growth has posed both challenges and opportunities for city planners, not least when it comes to the design of transportation and logistics systems for freight. But urbanization also fosters innovation and sharing, which have led to new models for organizing movement of goods within the city. In this chapter, we highlight one of these new models: crowd logistics. We define the characterizing features of crowd logistics, review applications of crowd-based services within urban environments, and discuss research opportunities in the area of crowd logistics.}

abstract = {Inbound logistics is a vital step in warehouse receiving processes and has a direct impact on supply chain cost and performance. As a result of an inefficient check-in operation, the incoming trucks may experience inordinate wait times between arrival and check-in, which in turn leads to unnecessary cost to the company in the form of detention fees (a penalty for holding the truck and driver beyond the agreed upon time) and delayed delivery of subsequent consignments. Moreover, prolonged idling of queuing trucks is not environmentally sustainable as it increases the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2), a primary contributor to climate change, in the atmosphere. This research is motivated by a case study of one of the largest consumer goods companies in the US, which pays over a million dollars in detention fees every year. The trucks entering the facility under study encounter an average waiting time of approximately an hour. The primary objective of this paper is to minimize the detention fees paid to the carrier by enhancing the check-in process of the inbound trucks, and the secondary goal is to reduce the CO2 emissions. Different check-in policies (staging area, dynamic dispatching rules, and automated technology) are proposed and compared to the current operations using discrete-event simulation models. The results suggest the adoption of a staging area with dynamic dispatching rule in the short-term as it requires minimal capital investment and achieves substantially lower detention fee and CO2 emission. A more expensive yet superior alternative is the use of automated technology for check-in processing as it eliminates detention fee and reduces the CO2 emissions from the trucks by 80%. The modeling approach and proposed dispatching rules are generic and can be adopted by any facility characterized by long waiting time for check-in and high detention fees.}

The main goal of this paper is the analysis of current state of parking areas in the Slovak republic. Based on the analysis, we design a methodology for evaluation parking areas with application on the conception settled in 2004, as well as a methodology for calculation of sufficient number of parking lots.

abstract = {Supplier selection problem has gained extensive attention in the prior studies. However, research based on Fuzzy Multi-Attribute Decision Making (F-MADM) approach in ranking resilient suppliers in logistic 4.0 is still in its infancy. Traditional MADM approach fails to address the resilient supplier selection problem in logistic 4.0 primarily because of the large amount of data concerning some attributes that are quantitative, yet difficult to process while making decisions. Besides, some qualitative attributes prevalent in logistic 4.0 entail imprecise perceptual or judgmental decision relevant information, and are substantially different than those considered in traditional suppler selection problems. This study develops a Decision Support System (DSS) that will help the decision maker to incorporate and process such imprecise heterogeneous data in a unified framework to rank a set of resilient suppliers in the logistic 4.0 environment. The proposed framework induces a triangular fuzzy number from large-scale temporal data using probability-possibility consistency principle. Large number of non-temporal data presented graphically are computed by extracting granular information that are imprecise in nature. Fuzzy linguistic variables are used to map the qualitative attributes. Finally, fuzzy based TOPSIS method is adopted to generate the ranking score of alternative suppliers. These ranking scores are used as input in a Multi-Choice Goal Programming (MCGP) model to determine optimal order allocation for respective suppliers. Finally, a sensitivity analysis assesses how the Supplier's Cost versus Resilience Index (SCRI) changes when differential priorities are set for respective cost and resilience attributes.}

Since 2016, the Government of Tanzania has been implementing TImR, an integrated Electronic Immunization registry-logistics management information system (EIR-LMIS) that includes stock notifications. The objective of this study is to estimate the impact of this intervention on vaccine availability.
Methods
Monthly stock-out data were collected from paper registers at facilities, an Excel-based system at districts, and the new system (TImR) across all 924 health facilities in Arusha, Tanga and Kilimanjaro Regions. Six months of stockout rates pre- and post-introduction, by antigen, were compared via a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). A mixed-effects logistic regression model with the TImR data identified predictors of vaccine availability across antigens.
Findings
Post-introduction, ANOVA models estimated that overall stock-out rates declined from a monthly average of 7.1% to 2.1% (p < 0.01). Three specific vaccines had fewer stock-outs; OPV’s monthly average dropped from 12.5% to 2.1% (p < 0.01), MR from 9.4% to 1.0% (p < 0.01) and DTP-HepB-HiB from 8.1% to 1.7% (p < 0.01). In the mixed-effects logistic regression model, controlling for antigen, odds of stock-out were 4.1% (95% CI: 3.3 – 4.9) lower for each week of tenure. Compared to DTP-HepB-HiB vaccine, odds of BCG vaccine being stocked out were 4.31 as high (95% CI: 3.1 – 5.0). The odds of being stocked-out were 29.7% lower for PCV (95% CI: 8.8 – 45.8) and 26.6% (95% CI: 3.4 – 44.1) lower for rotavirus vaccines compared to DTP-HepB-HiB. The odds of stock out were 37.7% lower for MR vaccine than DTP-HepB-HiB (95% CI: 18.1 – 52.6).
Conclusions
Tanzania’s integrated EIR-eLMIS may increase vaccine availability compared to its paper and Excel based system. Post-introduction of an eLMIS, the odds of a vaccine stock-out reduced over time. Further research could determine the impact of this intervention on vaccine wastage and replenishment response times.}

To obtain datasets for the agricultural routing problem, we gathered data from previous publications describing different fields. A mathematical model representing the optimisation of these datasets is also provided. The experimental results conclude that EHNS can either out-perform or obtain the same best solution as other algorithms in the literature. Among 9 problem sets, this study could find for 56% of the cases an improved combination of tracks saving an average of 10.68% non-working distance compared to other algorithms.

The objective is to minimize the total cost including the fixed cost and the energy consumptions. An improved artificial fish swarm (IAFS) algorithm is proposed, where a special encoding approach is designed to consider the problem feature with different type of vehicles. Then, improved preying and following heuristics are developed to perform the exploitation and exploration tasks. A novel customer satisfaction heuristic is embedded in the proposed algorithm, which makes the problem close to the reality. To further improve the performance of the algorithm, a right-shifting heuristic is designed to increase the customer satisfaction without increasing the energy consumption. An initialization heuristic based on the canonical Put Forward Insertion Heuristics (PFIH) is proposed to generate initial solutions with better performance. Finally, a set of realistic instances is generated to test the performance of the proposed algorithm, and after detailed experimental comparisons, the competitive performance of the proposed algorithm is verified.}

A revised U.S. heart allocation system (HAS) instituted 10/18/18 was designed to eliminate donation service area (DSA) boundaries/reduce geographic disparity. The new status 1-3 is equivalent to the old status 1A. The effect of HAS change on DSA and heart transplant program (HTP) logistics are unknown. We report our DSA and HTP experience 1 year later.
Methods
Data from 2 groups of patients defined by date of transplant were analyzed: pre HAS change (PRE, 10/18/17-10/17/18) and post HAS change (POST, 10/18/18-9/30/19). The data from our local DSA and our HTP PRE and POST are reported separately.
Results
Our local DSA has 2 adult/1 pediatric HTPs. During the PRE, the DSA recovered 65 adult hearts (30 allocated to our HTP, 13 to 2nd adult HTP, 1 to pediatric HTP). 21 hearts were allocated outside of the DSA (32.3%). 40 hearts were allocated to status 1A (62%). During the POST, the DSA recovered 75 adult hearts (10 allocated to our HTP, 4 to 2nd adult HTP). 61 (81.3%) hearts were allocated outside the DSA. 84% were allocated to the old status 1A equivalent (new status 1-3). Table illustrates our HTP statistics PRE and POST. 38 transplants were performed PRE, and 40 performed POST. Cold ischemic time increased 21% from 161 to 195 minutes. Flights were required in 15 PRE and 34 POST cases. While the miles per flight were similar PRE and POST (331 vs 354 nautical miles [nm]), the total nm increased 2.4 fold from 4969 to 12032. Travel time increased 25% from 251 to 315 minutes. Total organ acquisition cost increased 36% per transplant POST vs PRE.
Conclusion
After HAS change, 81% (vs 32%) of hearts were allocated outside the DSA and to the most urgent statuses (84 vs 62%). HAS change led to significant increase in cold ischemic time (21%), travel time (25%)/distance (242%), need for procurement team flyout (34 vs 15) and per transplant organ acquisition cost (36%). Further analysis are needed to examine the impact of HAS on procurement logistics, HTP cost, surgeon travel safety and post transplant survival.}

The paper examines the following questions: 1) What are the characteristics of the online grocery market? 2) Which challenges do retailers face in the online market? 3) And what strategies, in particular which logistics and distribution strategies, do they use to meet these challenges and with what success? The research is based on expert interviews combined with in-depth desk research. The paper focuses on the German and French online grocery market, where the forms of supply differ greatly. Applying a systematic research methodology, the paper first describes what types of online grocery services are currently available, mainly distinguishing between home delivery and collection options. The different patterns of storage and picking are compared in terms of their strengths and weaknesses and by assigning them to a modular scheme. The next step examines logistics processes and online sales-related distribution strategies, whereby most challenges are shown to be operational and optimisation is a challenge due to low margins. Consequently, existing location structures are often used, but new ones are also created. A typology of online logistics strategies and distribution organisations is derived with regard to the impact of online sales strategies on the logistics and transport structure. The paper concludes with a discussion of these impacts and an overview of future opportunities.}

This study aims to identify and prioritise these challenges for strategic importance of MN3PLs operating in China. Through an extensive literature review of 3PL research fourteen challenges for MN3PLs are identified and a theoretical underpinning relative to these challenges is provided. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) approach is employed to assess the criticality of challenges. Five executives from five large MN3PLs are invited to participate in this study. Results indicate that the most critical challenges confronted by the MN3PLs are guanxi, government regulations, price pressure, and transportation cost. To remain competitive MN3PLs must build guanxi networks with key stakeholders and minimize cost of delivery.}

Often, such communities are heavily dependent on maritime transportation for the ingress of essential goods such as food, fuel, and medicine. Major natural disasters can cause damage to critical infrastructures, causing disruptions to logistics chains and delays in the delivery of essential goods to vulnerable coastal communities. Estimating such delays is an important aspect of disaster preparedness planning, as it can support community-focused risk mitigating policies, improve emergency response operations, and help identify resilience strategies. In this article, a Bayesian Network risk model is developed for estimating the delays in maritime transportation to island communities in British Columbia, resulting from a major earthquake in the region. The model takes a regional scope and is primarily expert-driven. Correspondingly, it uses information about the earthquake intensity, infrastructure damages, impacts on shipping operations, and community needs to estimate delay times of the operability of different shipping services in the region under various scenarios. The model is illustrated through a series of hypothetical scenarios. Various validation tests furthermore indicate an adequate model performance for supporting regional disaster preparedness planning for the immediate response phase following an earthquake.}

Transport systems in urban and metropolitan areas in Brazil have suffered heavy impact over the years due to intensifying economic growth. Urban transport has been affected, particularly, by increasing numbers of passenger vehicles and the use of road vehicles to transport necessary goods and several problems are identified. City Logistics concepts and modelling can be an efficient tool to study the planning of cargo handling activities in urban areas. This study drew substantially on a survey by questionnaire administered to specialists in transport logistics. The questionnaire comprised six questions addressing items designed to contemplate the need for urban freight logistics planning, existing policies and regulations. The objective of the survey was to ascertain the need to develop specific guidelines for urban freight transport to be considered in urban planning. The guidelines that are the object of this study were drawn up on the basis of the questions posed and the expert interviewees’ responses. Transport Master Plans must embody the guidelines described in this research. In towns, mobility is complex and cargo circulation issues need to be carefully addressed. The guidelines presented in this study tackle freight mobility by renewing public policies. Some comparisons with major Brazilian capitals legislation are presented.}

The numerical method is based on a capacitated vehicle itinerary issue for time intervals, considering various heuristic procedures. The fixed and time-dependent travel times are considered. Compared to the standard operational costs, a multivariable objective function is developed that considers: (1) the risk associated with an incidental event involving a fuel tank; (2) that not all the roads are suitable for heavy vehicles transporting fuel products. These two additional terms permit to better quantify the costs for the operator, since it is assumed that roads with higher number of accidents or with not suitable infrastructure conditions have also higher probability of making the fuel tank experiences at least a delay during the day. Results show that a proper vehicle routes design on our multivariable objective function allows economizing about 40 km daily respect to a benchmark. The fuel company can also consider the itinerary design, modifying the weights used with the aim to comprise the additional variables with respect to the standard operational costs, thus assuring a higher safety route planning.}

Large amounts of forest biomass in the north of the country are not utilised. In this study, resource mapping of surplus forest biomass, (logging residues, tree stumps and mill by-products) is carried out according to ecological harvesting restrictions to determine the annual potential of this resource. Using a network of terminals, optimised supply chains are used to determine the cost of feedstock supply and upgrading of biomass to value-added torrefied pellets. The results indicate that the total biomass surplus is 5.75 Mt (dry mass), representing a forested procurement area half the size of Sweden (224 500 km2). The surplus represents two per cent of Sweden’s annual energy consumption and 60 % of its coal and coke use. Aggregation of the existing terminal network results in 274 to 1611 kt of biomass (dry mass) supplied to ten terminals. Supply and upgrading costs at the terminals reflect a trade-off between the size of procurement area and the scale of upgrading; a large plant capacity corresponds to a low upgrading cost but a large supply cost and vice versa. The lowest supply cost is 79 € t−1 (dry mass) of feedstock and the upgrading capacity ranges from 86 to 1310 kt (dry mass). Utilisation of the surplus would require an effective energy cost range of 27–37 € MWh−1 exclusive of delivery cost to the end user and operational profits – corresponding to a minimum torrefied pellet price of 131 € t−1. Though much higher than other solid fuels, the energy price is comparable to that of natural gas. The results of this study have importance for legislation supporting EU and Swedish energy policy objectives.}

A cross-sectional study, supported by the British Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons (BAOMS) and a national trainee-led recruitment team, was conducted over 14 weeks. A total of 132 participants took part (demographic data is reported in Part I). For fibular-flap mandibular reconstruction, most participants (69% - 91%) perceived printed titanium as superior to intraoperatively or preoperatively hand-bent plates for surgical duration, accuracy, dental restorability, and aesthetics. There was less agreement about complications and plate-failure risks. Most perceived printed plates to be superior to traditional wafer-based maxillary osteotomy for surgical duration (61%) and maxillary positioning (60%). For orbital floor repair, most perceived improvements in surgical duration (83%, especially higher-volume operators p=0.009), precision (84%), and ease of placement (69%). Rarely (less than 5%) was any outcome rated inferior to traditional techniques for any procedure. Perceived turnaround times and costs were variable, but the greatest consensus was for two-segment fibular-flap reconstructions and orbital floor repair. Industry estimates were generally consistent between two company representatives, but manufacturing-only costs differed when using in-house (departmental) designers. Costs and turnaround times are questionable barriers since few understand ‘real-world’ figures. Designing in-house can dramatically alter costs. Improved accuracy and surgical duration are common themes but biomechanical benefits are less-well understood. This study paints a picture of the potentially routine applications and benefits of printed titanium, capacity for uptake, understanding amongst surgeons, and areas for improvement.}

A mathematical model for the TDVRPTW is formulated by considering the time-dependent vehicle speeds, capacity, travel time, wait time, customer demand, service time, time window, impact of dynamic loads, and travel speed effect on vehicle carbon emissions. The objective of the TDVRPTW model is to minimize the sum of the fixed costs of the vehicle used, as well as the costs of drivers, fuel consumption, and carbon emissions. A calculation method for the road travel time across time periods with time-dependent speeds is presented. A congestion avoidance approach is proposed to avoid peak hour traffic congestion and temporal traffic congestion. An improved ant colony algorithm with a congestion avoiding approach (IACACAA) is elucidated according to the characteristics of the TDVRPTW model. The effectiveness of the proposed approaches was demonstrated in several computational experiments. The results show that the proposed IACACAA can scientifically plan the departure time and driving route for each vehicle, effectively avoid traffic congestion, and reduce the total distribution costs. The congestion avoidance approach effectively reduces vehicle fuel consumption and carbon emissions and protects the environment.}

One set of strategies for managing fleet distribution involves incentivising users to participate in relocating the vehicles. The objective of this study is to establish FFCS customers’ preferences for each of four incentivisation mechanisms: 1) vehicle delivery, 2) paid relocation, and 3–4) incentivisation for alternate vehicle pick-up and drop-off locations. Survey data (n = 311; collected Sept. 2017) from FFCS users in Vancouver and Washington D.C. are employed to quantify willingness-to-pay/accept (WTP/WTA) for these mechanisms. We find that a majority of respondents report positive attitudes (“definitely” or “possibly” willing to use) toward each of the four incentivisation mechanisms, with alternate drop-off the highest (57%) and paid relocation the lowest (40%). Regression analysis finds that user experiences using FFCS are generally stronger predictors of WTP/WTA than socio-demographic features, with (intuitively) the frequency of FFCS unavailability the strongest predictor. Age is the strongest socio-demographic predictor, with the WTP for vehicle delivery increasing and the size of required incentives for alternate pick-up/drop-off locations decreasing with age. Finally, we performed k-means cluster analysis of respondents based on the times-of-week that they report experiencing difficulty finding an available FFCS vehicle, and identified four distinct segments of users. However, we found generally weak relationships between WTP/WTA and the specific time-of-week periods that unavailability is experienced.}

abstract = {This study investigates the effects that carbon policies and green technologies may have on the integrated inventory of a two-echelon supply chain with consideration of carbon emissions during the processes of product production, transportation, and storage. The three carbon emissions policies: limited total carbon emissions, carbon taxation, and cap-and-trade, are considered in the study. The proposed model can assist firms in determining their corresponding optimal production quantity, delivery quantity, and green investment amount with an aim of minimizing the costs under different carbon emissions policies. Moreover, this study also provides practical implications for the government to make appropriate policies and regulations in balancing the trade-off between environmental protection and economic growth. Finally, the results indicate that firms adopting the carbon tax policy would prefer to invest in a relatively efficient green technology. With regard to the sources of carbon emissions, the effects of unit carbon emissions during production and unit distance of transportation are the most dramatic, and the cap limit has greater effects than the carbon emissions reduction factor of the green technology. Besides, the government should set the limit of carbon emissions within a reasonable range under the cap-and-trade policy to avoid suppliers overly trading their quotas of carbon emissions.}

Over recent decades the location of logistics jobs has shifted as the industry has consolidated into larger warehouse and distribution centers. We conduct a case study of the Los Angeles Region and identify the locations of jobs, existing workers, and potential workers—those who would be qualified to work in the industry. We find that logistics jobs are held by a greater share of race/ethnic minorities than the workforce as a whole, but the share of women is much lower than the workforce as a whole. Logistics jobs are more spatially clustered than workers, and job access by car is orders of magnitude greater than access by public transit. Public transit would have to be greatly improved, perhaps by using new platform-based services that could operate more efficiently in low density environments, in order to become a viable option for accessing logistics jobs.}

The findings indicate that providing a suitable location in the city center for urban logistics activities, in this case a micro depot, required substantial effort from local authorities. The chapter concludes that to attract other actors to initiate commercial use of cargo bikes public authorities should make this process easier to complete, either by (1) defining space in land-use plans for logistics activities, (2) setting aside existing locations for this usage, or (3) by developing a centrally located multi-user terminal. Overall, the Oslo case shows that a public-private partnership was fruitful in initiating testing of new sustainable ways of performing goods delivery in Oslo.}

abstract = {In recent years, the Coriolis mass flow meters (CMF), devices based on the Coriolis effect over a vibrating pipe, have developed better metrological performance and they are now a reasonable alternative for the custody transfer measurements. Nowadays, many custody transfer operations require measurement of the net volume (volume measured at a certain reference temperature) and, therefore, it is not feasible to use the CMF as a mass flow meter. However, the actual CMF can be used as net volume meters because they have special equipment to measure density and temperature, and a flow computer. In this work, firstly a mathematical simplification of the physical model is proposed for the CMF. We part from the dimensional analysis of the flow-phase relationship produced by the Coriolis force, the main physical principle behind these devices. A simplified formula is obtained and it permits identifying the magnitudes of influence of the CMF as a mass meter. Secondly, its metrological properties are characterized. For such purpose, a 4” straight tube commercial meter has been calibrated in volume, in the 50 to 165 m3/h range against a standard container and a bidirectional prover, employing gas oil and kerosene (JET-A1). These calibrations have turned out to be compatible with the ones performed by the manufacturer in mass and using water. Then it is verified that the CMF fulfills the requisites of the legal metrology: maximum error allowed, linearity and repeatability. Skewness is observed in the relative error (expressed in %) of the CMF and it has been researched to be due to systematic effects related to constructive parameters of the meter. Lineal correlation is verified between relative error and temperature, and between relative error and flow rate, with negative slopes of −0.03% °C−1 and −0.001% h/m3 respectively.}

The first two simulations on the regional hub showed that the number of containers transshipped at Colombo port increases while in neighbouring hub ports, it decreases as the transshipment time at Colombo port decreases. Moreover, the construction of a new container hub in south India would cause a significant decrease in the number of containers transshipped at Colombo port, if the new port is able to successfully attract all services operated by the largest shipping company. Another four simulations related to the logistics policies on hinterland transport in South Asia were then examined; namely, the improvement of the level of hinterland infrastructure around JNP, the international connection by ferry between India and Sri Lanka, multimodal use in hinterland transport between Dhaka and Chittagong in Bangladesh and new port construction in the AP state of India. The simulation results show that Indian West Coast ports would be very competitive in acquiring cargo originating from/destined to Delhi and, among them, a capacity constraint of hinterland transport around JNP is critical. Another finding shows the reduction of cross-border barriers as essential for promoting international ferry services between south India and Sri Lanka as well as the improvement in connecting rail services. Encouraging the use of rail and IWT between Dhaka and Chittagong could raise the share of these modes, especially IWT. The new container port in the AP state would encourage shifting cargo of inland cities such as Hyderabad and Nagpur to it, although the development of multiple ports in the same state might weaken the attractiveness as a whole of the state.}

The simulation with integrated receiver behaviour is applied to a small case as proof of concept.

In the base case with a demand of 180,000 dry Mg/year of biomass, the delivered costs ranged from $67.90 to $86.97 per dry Mg with an average of $79.58/dry Mg. The biomass delivered costs by county were from $67.90 to 150.81 per dry Mg across the northeastern U.S. Considered the entire study area, the delivered cost averaged $85.30/dry Mg for forest residues, $84.47/dry Mg for hybrid willow, $99.68 for switchgrass and $97.87 per dry Mg for Miscanthus. Seventy seven out of 387 counties could be able to deliver biomass at $84 per dry Mg or less a target set by US DOE by 2022. A sensitivity analysis was also conducted to evaluate the effects of feedstock availability, feedstock price, moisture content, procurement radius, and facility demand on the delivered cost. Our results showed that procurement radius, facility capacity, and forest residue availability were the most sensitive factors affecting the biomass delivered costs.}

In the modeling process, we make a classification of the demand nodes. Then, we introduce an innovative robust goal programming model with priority factors and optimize the distribution decisions under uncertain supply and capacity characterized by an uncertainty set. Under robust optimization techniques, the solving process of our proposed robust model is discussed and depends on a parametric cone program which can be efficiently solved by the commercial software. Finally, we conduct a number of numerical experiments about the Food Bank of Central and Eastern North Carolina in America to illustrate the application of our new model. The computational results show that our model can realize the trade-off between equity and effectiveness under uncertainty for humanitarian relief problem.}

In this context, the purpose of this article is to estimate the survival of a group of pieces of industrial port equipment known as solid bulk conveyors, thus contributing to decision-making in the maintenance process. To achieve this goal, the Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the probability of global survival, and the survival curves were compared using the Log-rank test. To this end, the effect of each covariate on the survival time of the conveyors was analyzed using the Cox regression model, for which an analysis of residuals and influential observations was conducted. The 75% probability of survival of solid bulk cargo is equivalent to an operational availability time of 444 h. It was found that, of the 95 conveyors that were evaluated, 38 (40%) failed and 57 (60%) were censored by the end of the study. The results indicate a significant reduction in the probability of survival of equipment during operation time, as well as a significant difference between the survival curves of the covariates of shift, types of minerals, the number of wagons and tons moved, indicating that these are important predictors in the Cox regression model.}

The model is based on VMI(vendor managed inventory) system where the vendor decides the product delivery quantity and time of delivery by tracking the consumer inventory and consumption patterns. The proposed mathematical framework involves a multi grid discrete time formulation which rigorously represents several intricacies related to products loading/unloading, jetty activities, port inventory limitations and ship voyages. Several scenarios representative of the actual process are designed and the results demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed framework in finding an optimum ship and jetty schedule that minimizes the total transportation cost in a computationally efficient manner.}

A key issue in large-scale silage production operations is the matching of the material processing capacity of forage harvester with the material removal capacity of transport units and the material processing capacity of the compactor, in order to maintain a steady material flow. This allows for the optimisation of the working chain. The objective of the paper is the development of a decision support system that for a given silage production system determines the configuration of the optimal number of transport units in each field of an area to be harvested that minimises the total operational cost of the production system under time constraints for the completion of the operation. The tool consists of the combination of two models, a simulation model and a linear programming based optimisation model. The simulation model was validated based on field trials. The simulation model generates a series of results regarding total operating time and total operation cost for different configuration of the allocated transport units based on machinery and field features, which results are used to build the cost matrix of the optimisation model. The capabilities of both the simulation model, as an individual tool, and the complete decision support tool were demonstrated. The tool provides performance evaluation measures that consider the interaction of the various parts of the working chain and can be easily tuned for other silage operations with different crops.}

Indeed, short-sea shipping is considered as one of the possible strategies to find competitive and sustainable transport alternatives with respect to the road-only transport, if a length of over 300km characterizes the connections. This study proposes and investigates several policies in order to increase the use of the short-sea shipping, moving freight from the road-only alternative to intermodal logistics chains based on Ro-Ro services. The objective is to quantify the potential demand of the combined road-sea transport as a function of different actions in terms of new Ro-Ro services/routes and subsidies to the road hauliers or to the shipping companies. The case study refers to domestic services involving the Italian seaports.}

In particular, the presence of conjugated double bonds on the fatty-acyl chain provides a preferential target for nitration generating nitro-FAs (NO2-FAs). The formation of NO2-FAs is a nonenzymatic process that requires reactive nitrogen species and occurs locally at the site of inflammation or during gastric acidification. NO2-FAs are electrophilic and display pleiotropic signaling actions through reversible protein alkylation. This review focuses on the endogenously formed NO2-FAs' mechanism of absorption, systemic distribution, signaling, and preclinical models. Understanding the dynamics of these processes will facilitate targeted dietary interventions and further the current pharmacological development aimed at low-grade inflammatory diseases.}

abstract = {Aim
The objective of the study was to estimate the cumulative incidence (CI) of relapse, relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) in ALL patients after a once-a-day fractionated TBI (F-TBI) regimen with 9.9 Gy. The secondary objectives were evaluation of short and long-term toxicity and non-relapse mortality (NRM).
Background
Total body irradiation (TBI), as a part of the conditioning regimen before allogeneic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), allows disease control by eradicating residual blast cells in the transplant recipient.
Materials and methods
Retrospective study conducted in patients with ALL who received between March 2003 and December 2013 a conditioning regimen with F-TBI and chemotherapy. Irradiation was delivered with 3.3 Gy once-a-day for three consecutive days.
Results
Eighty-seven patients were included. The median age was 19 years (range: 5–49 years). The 3-year CI of relapse was 30%. The estimated 3-year RFS and OS were 54% and 58%, respectively. Cumulative incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) grade II–IV and chronic GVHD (cGVHD) was 31% and 40%, respectively. Interstitial pneumonitis was observed in 2 patients. The 3-year CI of NRM was 16%. In multivariate analysis, cGVHD was associated with a lower CI of relapse (RR = 0.26, 95% CI: 0.07–0.95, p = 0.04). High-risk cytogenetics was associated with a lower RFS (RR = 2, 95 CI: 1.04–3.84, p = 0.03). Grade II-IV aGVHD was an independent predictor of higher CI of NRM (RR = 6.7, 95% CI: 1.4–31.7, p = 0.02).
Conclusions
Once-a-day F-TBI regimen is effective, safe and practical in patients who underwent ASCT for ALL.}

These vaccines are produced and transported in large quantities to suffice the needs of several countries. Before arriving at the end-users, the vaccines need to be stored at extremely low temperatures and distributed through reliable cold chain logistics networks. Thus, the timely and cost-effective distribution of COVID-19 vaccines via cold chain logistics has become a complex operational challenge. In this paper, we develop a simulation-based approach combining both route optimization and dynamic simulation to improve the logistics performance for COVID-19 vaccine distribution. A state-of-the-art simulation package called anyLogistix is used to perform a real-world case study in Norway. With the data of periodic vaccine demands, customer and warehouse locations, vehicle-related costs and emissions, and expected service levels, implications are obtained based on the analysis of several scenarios. Our experimental results reveal that the service level, cost-effectiveness, environmental performance, and equity of a cold chain vaccine logistics system can be significantly influenced by the fleet size, the fleet composition, the type of vehicle used, and the route optimization. Thus, these factors need to be holistically considered in the planning of an effective COVID-19 vaccine distribution system.}

In the new picture coal gently gains on oil and hydroelectric gains on natural gas even if it is three times smaller. Finally, renewables—wind, geothermal, solar, biomass, and waste—grow exclusively on the expense of nuclear, and are poised to overtake it by the late 2030s. By mid-21st century, coal, oil, and natural gas still remain the main players of comparable size. Hydroelectric has almost doubled in size. The only significant substitution is that of renewables having replaced nuclear albeit remaining at less than a ¼ the size of the other three energy sources. U.S. oil produced by fracking is forecasted to cease by mid-21st century, while oil produced by traditional methods should continue on its slowly declining trend. US oil production is likely to represent less than 1% of the oil consumed worldwide by mid-21st century.}

The present paper integrates index creation and general DEA guidelines, and proposes a framework for the creation of a long-distance cargo haulage performance index, advancing towards the limitations of the previous efforts. The methodology is applied to the context of soybean transportation, one of the relevant Brazilian exporting products, during the harvest of 2015/2016, from the main mid-sized producing regions to the key exporting ports, by land transportation. The proposed approach and findings can provide insights into public and private long-term investment strategies and infrastructure policies in Brazil and other developing countries in a similar context.}

Among factors which influence delays in supply chains are long distances between activities in a complex global supply chain and the response latency of older workers, in the case that there are no properly developed programs for avoiding this phenomenon. The analysis of a trade-off between these factors is the subject of this article. Mitigating the decreasing functional capacities of the ageing workforce, to keep the old workers’ productivity on the higher level while their functional capacities are decreasing, collaborative robots and smart workstations are advised. The second solution is to move a part of production to foreign countries where the demographic structure is in favour of young workers, and human resources are much cheaper. In the article, we are developing a model for a trade-off between two solutions: to invest in collaborative robots or to develop early retirement schemes and to move the production plants abroad. Therefore, the basic trade-off is between robotisation, keeping short distances between activity cells in a supply chain, and transportation costs which include also additional costs of delays in a system. The model is based on the skeleton of the extended MRP theory of Grubbström and Bogataj and evaluated by the NPV and, as a novelty, also by the actuarial present value APV in the criterion function. Extended MRP enables to extend the model of multi-echelon systems which is presented by the same authors in the International Journal of Production Economics, under the title: The ageing workforce challenge: investments in collaborative robots or contribution to pension schemes, from the multi-echelon perspective to global supply chains. The article explains why it is important to link the annuities for repaying the investment in robots to the flow of funds for workers’ salaries when weighing between early retirement and investment in collaborative robots. The model is applied to a real industrial case of the production of pumps and can be easily implemented also in other international supply chains where the differences in the demographic structure, salaries and automatization between countries are substantial and the eligibility of transport costs is questionable.}

Thereof, this paper proposes an integrated simulation-based optimization method to cope with uncertainty and complexity.

This paper investigates the cross-border e-commerce market from the airport's perspective. First, a market analysis is carried out and an overview of the air cargo industry is given. Moreover, the relevance of e-commerce for airports is highlighted. Second, by means of a literature review, the potential factors on which airports can focus to attract cross-border e-commerce are identified. Those factors are then verified by conducting structured interviews with different actors involved in the cross-border e-commerce air transport chain and as well as by performing an AHP analysis. As a result the following factors are identified as an absolute prerequisite to develop cross-border e-commerce at an airport: ability to pre-clear e-commerce goods, high airlift and land capacity. Furthermore, the e-commerce market should be facilitated by seamless data exchange. The outcome of this research will be relevant for the industry as it will enable airports to check whether their strategy is focusing on the right critical success factors to boost the local e-commerce cargo flows.}

abstract = {To reduce emissions within urban areas, a shift from conventional vehicles for distribution to electric vehicles is often discussed to reduce local emissions. Studies have shown that this shift would be possible, yet it has not happened. This chapter analyzes why the shift has not happened so far and which further developments are needed to enable such a change. Based on the analysis of various pilot projects carried out in Germany, the developments that are needed to facilitate a swift rollout of e-vehicles for urban distribution are mapped out. The advantages of electric vehicles for urban distribution are described as well as still-existing challenges, user acceptance encountered, and requirements toward innovative distribution concepts beyond the electric vehicle itself. This chapter closes with an outlook on how a wider spread use of e-vehicles for urban distribution can be supported and improved.}

abstract = {The Hospital Pharmacy of a Local Health Unit (LHU) in greater Oporto plays a major role in the community. In addition to providing medicines to the entire Internal Unit, it has created a service called "Hospital Ambulatory Pharmacy", which allows continued hospital treatments at home, in a more comfortable and familiar environment. This is mostly due uderfunding which has hindered recruitment of health professionals as well a growing concern for the comfort of patients as they convalesce. The Hospital Ambulatory Pharmacy’s main problems are both recurring stock-outs and over-stocks; the fact that medicines’s delivery routes are not completed, and that medical staff lacks awareness of the techniques to overcome the logistic issues involved. As a methodology, a context analysis was carried out, KPI's were created to quantify the problems and raise health professionals’ awareness of what was happening. Solutions for storage were analysed and visits were made to a central hospital to analyse the solutions adopted to solve the same problems. The most appropriate inventory management policies were considered for the organization of existing and further resources. We chose to create an Advanced Warehouse with Level Replenishment. The levels were defined considering the demand of each medicine and divided into three different classes to use the best strategy for each type of demand. Then, and with the help of the LHU IT team, the inventory management module of the information system was parameterized, so stock replenishment could be done electronically. All these changes resulted in a 30 % reduction in stock-out. At the beginning of the study, stock-outs would reach peaks of 6 %. These were reduced to 4.5 % at a point at which professionals were already more aware of the logistic problem, and finally to 1.5 %, in the final phase, at a time when the proposal had already been implemented. Over-stock was reduced by 66 %. Delivery routes were stipulated, and compliance was verified. A novel service developed to increase the well-being of patients monitored at home which it is intended to improve the service provided to the users and at the same time reduce operational costs. As a contribution to the knowledge, in addition to the case study presented to be a novelty in terms of scientific articles published because it is a service implemented in the distribution of medications to patients at home, mostly with oncologic diseases. Several methods from Lean Thinking were used, such as, Kanban System and Advanced Warehouse for inventory management levelling and optimization techniques, as well as, operational KPIs, with the purpose to reach out the improvement of program planning and evaluation. This approach resulted in some improvements, namely, the increase of the quality of the healthcare services for the population. And, in terms to reduce stock and excess stock-outs, to reduce inventory costs, setting the delivery routes, raising the entire medical team’s awareness of the problem and committing to optimization a reality.}

A particular solution of the evacuation process shall be analyzed according to the Czech Technical Standards (ČSN) with the use of fire engineering approach. Having analyzed evacuating a selected object (building), a practical solution of the evacuation by means of simulations shall be carried out, using the theory of movement of persons, and performed in the Pathfinder program. The simulations are applied both to assess the object’s current state and to evaluate individual measures proposed to streamline the evacuation process. The output includes assessing an impact of the measures on the evacuation process.}

abstract = {This paper aims to characterize the relocation of warehouses in the São Paulo Metropolitan Region (SPMR) considering the spatial structure of changes in warehouse locations. We also discuss the potential factors that could attract warehouses to their location, especially in peripheral regions. The study encompasses the period between 1992 and 2017 and analyzes the influence of geographical, economics, road infrastructure, municipality service tax rate, cargo theft, and real estate prices on logistics facility location. The results show no evidence of logistics sprawl in SPMR during the studied period, although a small sprawl appeared between 2010 and 2017, moving the barycenter to the Northwestern direction of the SPMR. The main factors that influence the decision to move the warehouses are the low cost of land, lower tax, and a well-served infrastructure with highway intersections. There is a positive spatial correlation between warehouse per capita and cargo theft.}
