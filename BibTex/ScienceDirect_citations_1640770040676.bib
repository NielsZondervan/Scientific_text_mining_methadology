abstract = {This paper contributes to the emerging body of research on crowdshipping, which is a collaborative strategy that distributes delivery tasks to a mass of actors that act as ordinary couriers, aiming at reducing delivery costs and supporting sustainability. The study focuses on last mile delivery activities, where numerous app-based delivery platforms have recently emerged. The paper provides an overview of the operational characteristics of these platforms based on an in-depth study of a sample of major crowdshipping services (state-of-practice) and a comprehensive review of the state-of-research. After comparing platform services and characteristics, we identified four core (typological) factors that differentiate services: platform (service) type, delivery type, delivery mode, and pricing strategy; and six categories for service challenges and opportunities. Moreover, the review of the state-of-research synthesized their findings with respect to the identified practical challenges to discover opportunities for future work. Overall, the study found that there is a mismatch between practical challenges and scientific solutions. The literature has not addressed all challenges identified in practice, such as couriers’ work conditions and pricing, which are still unresolved issues. The majority of articles were exploratory in nature with their findings based on hypothetical random instances. More research is needed with empirical case studies to evaluate the service net effects on each actor (e.g., senders, receivers, couriers, and platforms) in particular, and on the society in general, in terms of traffic externalities, quality of life, cost and revenue. The paper ends with a discussion of promising areas for future research.}

abstract = {Wastage of perishable food products is a severe concern to society and needs to be addressed to ensure food security for all. Moreover, the food waste when sent to landfills, decomposes to produce greenhouse gases like methane and carbon dioxide. The emergence of food banks and aggregators has abated the problem of food wastage to a certain extent. An aggregator, which connects the retailers to the food banks, plays a critical role in ensuring that the food reaches the food banks on time. However, to ensure food security and reduce wastage of food, it is essential that food aggregators remain profitable. The aggregator has to determine the number of heterogeneous vehicles to hire from the market and allocate them their route on a daily basis depending on donations committed by the retailers and also take into account potential environmental impact from the decomposition of food waste and carbon emitted from hired vehicles. Hence, we propose decision support for aggregators, using data from an aggregator based in Turkey, which can help in reducing food wastage by allocating the donated food items from retailers to food banks while maximizing the profitability of the aggregator and minimizing the environmental impact. We have also analyzed how the availability of different types of vehicles can impact the aggregator's profit. Furthermore, the effect of various model parameters such as transportation cost, and percentage of retailers' gain paid to the aggregator on the total profit along with the impact of distances on types of vehicles hired is also analyzed. We have compared two strategies that the aggregator could possibly employ and generate managerial insights.}

The effective and time-saving dispatching process in affected areas is pivotal in rescue operations. In this study, we formulate a reliable time-dependent vehicle routing problem with time windows in a multigraph based network. In such networks, there exist parallel arcs with multiple attributes between nodes. The purpose of the provided model is to minimize delays in delivering prioritized items in disaster response operations. It also controls the minimum reliability of each route. Controlling the reliability in relief distribution gives this assurance that emergency packages on vehicles can reach their destinations safely and in a timely manner. In order to solve the problem, a novel restricted dynamic programming is applied to the problem through the giant-tour representation. The proposed algorithm can reach the optimal solution when utilized in an unrestricted way. In addition, a modified caching genetic algorithm and a three-phase optimization method based on the tabu search heuristic are provided to deal with larger instances in reasonable computation times. Finally, a real transportation case is presented to illustrate the potential applicability of the model in urban environments. The results accentuate the efficiency of the proposed methods and show the significance of multigraph to accelerate the distribution operations for reliable emergency logistics planning.}

The goal is to minimize the total social costs, which include setup and initial supplies, as well as the deprivation costs associated with delayed access to supplies. The models incorporate various earthquake magnitude-specific uncertainties, such as facility damage, casualty by severity, and travel time. Examining the concept of social costs in light of an emerging concern in humanitarian logistics - the robustness of relief networks, we model two types of robustness: parameter uncertainty within a scenario and relative regret across scenarios. This unique approach reveals (1) the magnitude of social costs in the aftermath of an earthquake; (2) the hidden risks associated with inaccurate modeling of deprivation costs; and (3) the impact of budgetary constraints. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach via a case study featuring the Northridge region in California, which experienced two of the strongest earthquakes recorded in North America in 1971 and 1994.}

abstract = {The purpose of this research is to understand how and why warehouses have changed location over time from central urban areas to the urban periphery: spatial decentralization. Over the last decade, the logistics industry has been restructured to transport large volumes of goods more quickly and reliably. Concurrently, the warehousing industry experienced changes in facility size and location: large warehouses have been built on the urban outskirts. This spatial shift is attributed to inventory and transport cost trade-offs: the gains from lower land prices and scale operation outweigh the increase in transport costs as warehouses decentralized from central urban areas. As a case study, I examine location choices of 5364 warehousing facilities in Los Angeles, CA. I hypothesize that (a) the location choice varies by facility size and (b) the location choice logic has changed over time. Results suggest significant differences in the effect of location choice factors over facility size and over time. For warehouses built before 1980, the most influential factors are local market, labor, and seaport/intermodal terminal proximity. In contrast, for warehouses built after 2000, lower land price and airport/intermodal terminal proximity have the greatest effects.}

It exploits properties of k-sum optimization to derive specific formulations for the monotone DOMP (MDOMP), that arises when the λ weights are non-decreasing monotone, and new formulations for the general non-monotone DOMP. The main idea in our approach is to express ordered weighted averages as telescopic sums whose terms are k-sums, with positive and negative coefficients. Formulations of k-sums with positive coefficients derive from the linear programming representations obtained by Ogryczack and Tamir (2003) and Blanco, Ali, and Puerto (2014). Valid formulations for k-sums with negative coefficients are more elaborated and we present 4 different approaches, all of them based on mixed integer programming formulations. An extensive computational experience based on a collection of well-known instances shows the usefulness of the new formulations to solve difficult problems such as trimmed and anti-trimmed mean.}

abstract = {Purpose
To analyze core processes of the MRI workflow and to evaluate efficiency for improved patient throughput and capacity utilization.
Method
Prospective data collection was conducted during a four-week time period and a total sum of 160 working hours for each of the two 1.5 T MRI scanners. Three core processes defined the value stream of patient handling before, during and after the MRI examination: i) Scheduling & Registration, ii) Organization & Preparation, and iii) MR scan. Quantitative data was collected for six essential time intervals of the MRI workflow.
Results
A total of 302 MRI examinations were assessed. The workflow analysis revealed that effective utilization of scan capacity during operating hours varied by scanner (Scanner 1: 77 % / Scanner 2: 85 %). Mean process times for were: patient preparation time 18.9 min (±15.1) p = 0.11, scan preparation time 5.7 min (±4.0) p = 0,015, effective scan time 39.6 min (±18.0) p < 0.0001, scan room occupation time 50.9 min (±21.0) p < 0.0001, clean-up time 5.6 min (±3.2) p = 0.001, total patient handling time 69.7 min (±26.3) p < 0.0001, turnover time 13.4 min (±21.4) p = 0.65.
Conclusions
This study demonstrates the utility and applicability of a standardized core processes analyses for MRI scanning, which identified underutilization of scanning capacities, related to multiple factors, such as punctuality of patients, the number of same day cancellations, the process of placing an IV access and patient transport contribute to underutilization of MRI scanners. Furthermore, proactive patient management and effective communication with patients and referring physicians might have relevant time saving potential in the scan room.}

This paper is focused on utilization of multi-criteria analysis for electric vehicles selection in the context of their usability for deliveries realization in cities. Moreover, it also presents general issues regarding the use of alternative fuels in motor vehicles, with emphasis on electric vehicles. It discusses the extent to which electric vehicles are used. It describes the key parameters for determining the usability of electric vehicles in urban deliveries. Based on the formulated assumptions, a multi-criteria model is proposed to enable selecting, out of the defined vehicles catalogue, solutions that are optimal in terms of potential effectiveness.

From this perspective, Improved Encryption with Optimized Variable Size Windowing based SV (IE-OVSW-SV) system has been designed which authenticates the speaker’s identities based on watermarking and encrypting the optimal speech signal features. For encryption, an enhanced AES algorithm was combined with improved RC4 keystream generator to generate the AES key. But it has a high computational complexity and does not ensure the maximum security level due to the utilization of the same symmetric key for cryptography. Therefore, in this article, Chaotic-based Advanced Encryption Standard (CAES) is proposed in which simplified enhanced AES is proposed by removing few rounds of the permutation process to reduce its computational complexity and finally combined with an improved quadratic chaotic map encryption in addition to increase the security of encrypted speech signal features during communication. Further, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) classification is used for verifying the speaker’s identity. Finally, the experimental results show the performance efficiency of CAES compared to the enhanced AES algorithm.}

A case study is presented from the Netherlands which uses tailor-made surveys, bicycle trip data and online shopping statistics. The study quantifies the importance of influencing factors. The insights can be used to design a bike crowdshipping platform which brings together the demand and the supply sides effectively.

Results using a specially-developed algorithm to model operations of a real carrier in an area of central London, UK, suggested that the carrier could reduce CO2 emissions by 45%, NOx emissions by 33%, driving distance by 78% and curbside parking time by 45%. Overall cost savings to the carrier were estimated to be in the range 34–39%. Scaling up the modelled emissions savings to London’s Central Activities Zone, an area of approximately 30 km2 and with current total annual parcel delivery distance of around 15 million km, could see annual emissions savings in the region of 2 million kg CO2 and 1633 kg NOx if all carriers utilised porters or cycle couriers. The key operating challenges identified were related to sorting and consolidating items by weight and volume, parcel handover arrangements and how to deal with express items and failed deliveries.}

abstract = {Spare parts play an essential role in the logistical support of heavy-asset industries that require highly reliable and efficient operations. This paper focuses on spare-parts classification using transfer learning theory via deep convolutional neural networks. Through the present literature, multi-criteria spare-parts classification is innovatively realized using image-processing methods with a three-phase model. Neural network architecture was reconstructed based on the pre-trained VGG-19 in the first step. And the hierarchical inference model of spare parts was subsequently built with a purpose of data visualization and image conversion. In the final phase, the proposed model was trained and tested using actual data generated from a real-world case which demonstrated its excellent performance with an average accuracy of 96.36% in the five-fold cross-validation. To further verify the model, a comparative scheme was proposed using different convolutional neural network-based learning methods, including well-known AlexNet and ResNet-50. The proposed model's performance is outstanding with an overall accuracy of 95.87%. This novel transfer learning-based application for the multi-criteria classification problem successfully achieves an adjustable solution framework for spare-parts management.}

In comparison to currently applied methods of detecting and tracking dynamic objects in the field of AGVs this approach is innovative. This is due to the shift in the capture of tracking data to ceiling cameras exclusively, for the reason of gaining a holistic overview of the complete tracking area. The application case discussed in this paper is for AGVs in the frame of a research project. However, this approach can be applied for different use cases which require a pursuit and tracking of dynamic objects that is based on multiple cameras.}

abstract = {Among the many extensions of the classical capacitated vehicle routing problem, multi-compartment vehicle routing problems have been studied extensively only in recent years. Vehicles with multiple compartments enable the joint delivery or collection of goods with differing characteristics in separate compartments that would otherwise need separate transportation with single-compartment vehicles. This enables greater flexibility in routing decisions and order assignment to tours. The versatile use of these vehicles is leading to increasing relevance in both research and industry, and consequently in an increasing number of related publications. The available studies, however, consider substantially different problem variants. As no survey on multi-compartment vehicle routing problems is available so far, the identification of common problem features and research opportunities has been difficult. This paper aims at overcoming this difficulty by proposing an extended typology for multi-compartment vehicle routing problems and extensively reviewing the existing literature. Although only few identical problems can be identified, common attributes among similar applications (regarding compartment flexibility, for example) are observed. Suggestions for future research directions are also proposed.}

Aiming to provide practice-oriented decision support, multi-objective routing problems attract more and more attention in academic literature. This contribution offers a wide overview of which application-oriented multi-objective routing problems are treated and what kind of trade-off is investigated. Furthermore, the algorithmic approach is analyzed with regard to its fitness assignment strategy, i.e. how the multiple objectives are handled, and its search strategy to solve the problem. In order to structure the literature, we propose a classification in which every identified objective is sorted into a category and related to problem elements. Both problem-specific and general research gaps in multi-objective routing problems are identified and offer a starting point for future research. Lastly, fitness assignment strategies are extensively discussed and insights regarding their usage are given.}

This situation is particularly important in the last-mile urban distribution in city centers due to the fact that private cars, public transportation, and freight transportation fiery compete for the same space. This article contextualizes this phenomenon in two European medium-size cities: Angers (France) and Pamplona (Spain). The paper also draws the current situation regarding their mobility and freight-delivery systems in their city centers. Thus, an apposite survey has been deployed in both cities in order to collect social perceptions and mobility patterns data. Additionally, we have included a conjoint analysis study for examining the characteristic determinants for aerial (drone) distribution. Likewise, meaningful conclusions can be extracted from the analysis of the results generated by the current analysis. Firstly, we have realized the immediate effects of a recent sustainable urban-mobility plan at Pamplona, which contrasts with the Angers case, where no similar plan has been deployed yet. Secondly, we have focused our attention on the socio-economic factors that determine the mobility in both cities. Thirdly, we have observed, in both cities, a clear preference for electric vehicles and cargo-bikes for driving inside the city center. Finally, there is a rejection to use drones for merchandise delivery.}

The duration of a path is inherently stochastic because of delays and the possibility of overbooking. We study a problem faced by a company that supports shippers with advice for the route selection. The challenge is to find Pareto-optimal solutions regarding the route’s costs and the probability of arriving before a specific deadline. We show how this probability can be calculated in a network with scheduled departure times and the possibility of overbookings. To solve this problem, we give an optimal algorithm, but as its running time becomes too long for larger networks, we also develop a heuristic. The idea of this heuristic is to replace the stochastic variables by deterministic risk measures and solve the resulting deterministic optimization problem. The heuristic produces, in a fraction of the optimal algorithm’s running time, solutions of which the costs are only a few percent higher than the optimal costs.}

For order dispatching, an approach is proposed that uses multi-agent reinforcement learning, where AMR agents learn to bid on orders based on their individual observations. The approach is investigated in a robot simulation environment. The results show a more efficient order allocation compared to commonly used dispatching rules.}

We advance and analyze models that suggest LNG infrastructure development plans for refueling stations that support pipeline-to-ship and truck-to-ship bunkering, specifying locations, types, and capacities, and that take into account the characteristics of LNG, such as boil-off during storage and loading. We develop an effective primal heuristic, based on Lagrangian relaxation, for the solution of the models.

The aim of the paper is to determine the optimal size of a box the products are stored in considering both financial (in terms of cost) and ergonomic (in terms of worker fatigue) aspects. The paper first develops a biomechanical model to estimate the expected fatigue-recovery parameters associated with the packaging process. Secondly, it proposes an optimization model that minimizes the total relevant cost of the packaging process consisting of the cost of packaging material and the cost of working time, which includes the time required for packing items, setting up and handling boxes, transporting boxes to the shipping area, and idle time cost. Thirdly, the fatigue-recovery approach is integrated into the optimization model to determine the optimal box size from a given set of alternative boxes as well as the work schedule that minimize the total relevant cost while satisfying the upper bound on the estimated total (accumulated) fatigue level. The developed model is then analysed in a numerical experiment inspired by a case observed in industry. The results of the numerical analysis show that smaller box sizes are less sensitive to changes in the maximum permitted fatigue level and that they lead to lower total relevant cost for low wage cost. Larger boxes, in turn, are recommended for higher wage cost. The maximum permitted fatigue level and the box sizes also influence the fatigue range experienced by the worker as well as the share of productive time the worker spends on the job.}

This paper abstracts from the peculiarities of each application and presents a generic problem setting, which synchronizes inbound and outbound flows in general hub terminals. We derive a parallel machine scheduling problem with job synchronization. Jobs processed on machines represent vehicles loaded and/or unloaded at different service points. Whenever two vehicles aim to transfer loads among each other, they should simultaneously be processed, so that loads can directly be exchanged without intermediate storage and double-handling. To reach this general aim we predefine target transfer durations for job pairs and aim to maximize the weighted realized transfer durations. For this elementary problem, computational complexity is investigated and two mixed-integer programming models are introduced. Furthermore, an efficient and easily adaptable heuristic based on fix and optimize is presented. Finally, we show how to customize our generic model to specific hub terminals.}

In this paper, we formulate an optimization model that integrates CDPs in the design of the overall distribution network, including the location of upstream transshipment facilities. The model accounts for changes in demand density due to the placement of CDPs. It considers demand aggregation at the CDP for both forward and return flows, and the impact of failed deliveries and failed return pickups on the routing cost. The model considers different route options and solves them using extended routing cost approximation formulae thus allowing the implementation of the model on large-scale problems. We then apply the model to solve a real-world case study on the distribution network of a major Brazilian retailer. The results demonstrate that failed deliveries and failed return pickups increase both the last-mile cost and the overall cost of distribution, and CDPs effectively reduce these costs by aggregating the demand and minimizing travel time.}

During phase one the formulation is solved aiming at maximizing the weighted sum of products delivered, whereas for the second phase, the formulation is solved aiming at minimizing the number of trucks, while ensuring that the objective function attained in phase one is not compromised. A greedy heuristic is also proposed in order to better quantify the advantages of adopting the proposed exact approach with respect to solution quality. To assess the performance of the proposed approach we used two sets of test instances, a large set of randomly generated instances that resemble the practical application that motivated this research, and a small set of real instances provided by the company.

It is widely used in ecological and Earth-system models to simulate atmosphere-biosphere exchanges of energy, water, and carbon. However, the current global land cover (GLC) products lack data consistencies in land cover classes, spatial scale, temporal extent, and the image source and have low accuracy. This study aimed to create a time-series GLC dataset with high accuracy by integrating the current multiple GLC products and correcting the spatial and temporal errors that did not conform to reasonable rules. A logistic regression indicator method was proposed to integrate CCI2012, MODIS2012, and GLCNMO2013 for spatial optimization and integration. As a result, the GLC2012 was generated with the user’s accuracy of 74.4%, which was 3.4–10.9% higher than that of the above products. The GLC2012 product was sequentially superimposed by the yearly changes of the CCI-LC product to form a time-series dataset from 1999 to 2018. Then, an abnormal temporal change detection and reconstruction model (CDR) was developed to detect and correct data sequences. The pixels with any changes from 1999 to 2018 were divided into three types of real, possible, and pseudo change. The possible change was required to determine fault or truth and pseudo change was defined as a false change. The spectral similarity method was proposed to correct the false change class. Finally, a 2000–2017 improved GLC annual time-series dataset (IGLC) with a spatial resolution of 0.01° was produced. Hence, the production of a set of high-precision, time-continuous GLC datasets is of great significance for monitoring global ecological environmental protection and urban development, and for proposing corresponding policies and recommendations.}

In accordance with the 2012 fund policy, the government collects funds from producers and subsidizes recycling enterprises. However, this policy has encountered difficulties. The 2016 White Paper on WEEE Recycling, Treatment and Reuse states that while the funds collected from producers were 2.61 billion Yuan, the subsidies provided to recycling enterprises were 4.714 billion Yuan, which is a gap of 2.104 billion Yuan. In addition, this policy did not incentivize producers to invest in WEEE recycling. Our paper aims to answering the following questions: (1) What is the impact of the current WEEE processing fund policy? (2) How can producers’ green innovation in WEEE recycling be promoted? We use evolutionary game theory to investigate the strategies used by producers and recyclers and explore their evolutionary behaviors under two policies: the 2012 fund policy (the current policy) and the Fund Relief Policy (a newly designed policy). The results indicate that the Fund Relief Policy can motivate producers’ green innovation behavior, improve the profitability of recyclers, and alleviate the financial pressure on government to a certain extent.}

abstract = {Industry 4.0 is characterized to a large extent by the use of CPS, in which objects can network with one another and with higher-level information and communication technologies such as the Internet, and thus organize and optimize themselves independently and in real time. Logistics is regarded as an extremely predestined field of application and is therefore particularly affected by the effects of work organization. Both the strategic level of supply chain design and operative activities in intralogistics deserve special mention. New management for the organization of the digital enterprise transformation and with it accompanying innovative concepts of the personnel management become necessary. Game-based approaches offer great potential for the development of the necessary employee competencies in the context of the change of the working world by industry 4.0. The present contribution elaborates the current state of research on the effect of Serious Games and gives an outlook on which conditions are necessary for the development of the potentials of Serious Games and their success as personnel development measures in the operational context. It concludes with an outlook on how this success can be measured within the framework of strategic personnel management.}

The electric vehicles operating in the different echelons have different load capacities, battery driving ranges, power consumption rates, and battery swapping costs. We propose an integer programming formulation and a hybrid algorithm that combines a column generation and an adaptive large neighborhood search (CG-ALNS) to solve the problem. We conducted extensive computational experiments, demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model, and show the efficiency of the CG-ALNS algorithm. In addition, we explore the interplay between battery driving range and the effectiveness of vehicle emission reduction through sensitivity analysis.}

We propose to evaluate purchase, assignment, and sales policies in a holistic simulation environment that directly models heterogeneous vehicle attributes and tracks their evolution over time. Using data from a large international humanitarian organization (LIHO), the simulator can identify the rationale behind seemingly ad-hoc decisions by field managers at LIHO. For instance, by selling vehicles later than LIHO recommends, managers are actually reducing their costs; similarly, managers decline to switch vehicles between mission types because the benefits to the operational cost turn out to be marginal at best.}

Extensive computational studies are carried out to evaluate the performance of a rolling horizon approach with respect to the optimal cost. Numerical results show that this heuristic provides effective solutions in short computational time. Managerial insights are finally drawn.}

The first chapter will deal with possible regulatory measures, which are meant especially low-emission zones, or noise reduction measures. Their implementation may affect carriers providing supplementation in the city center, given the need to operate vehicles with certain exhaust emission and noise limits in the area. Researching vehicles that currently provide transport services, we will also get an overview of their current status, particularly in terms of environmental impact. Especially good air quality is very important in areas with high pedestrian intensity at present. The paper also provides an answer, for example, to the question of what proportion of vehicles with a specified emission class would influence the implementation of a low-emission zone in the area. This would make it possible to quantify the costs for carriers in case of the regulatory measure’s implementation in the area and to try to find the optimum center between the economic costs of regulatory measures and the provision of supplementation of the area.}

We present a baseline agent-based model imitating the operations of a real-world retailer. We then introduce electric vans into our model in order to ascertain how charging power and charging strategy influence the retailer’s operations. Even though electric vans cannot match the performance of diesel vehicles using the same fleet size, our simulation experiments suggest that, by considering the quantity of orders and the geographical distribution of its customers, an operator can determine a suitable charging strategy that can minimise late delivery. Additionally, by employing a suitable charging strategy, an operator might avoid making unnecessary investments and reduce the barriers for electric vehicle adoption.}

In this paper, we introduce an extended version of the VRPSD, called the Vehicle Routing Problem with Shipment Consolidation (VRPC), a model that considers not only split deliveries, but also shipment exchanges (transfers) between different vehicles at certain customer locations (a process referred to as mid-route shipment consolidation). We conduct a series of numerical experiments, as well as a case study, to show that VRPC solutions match or outperform those of the VRPSD. Results indicate that up to 10 percent savings may be attained through the VRPC in lieu of the VRPSD, which implies that the efficiency of last-mile delivery may be improved by allowing mid-route shipment consolidation at select customer locations.}

abstract = {Background
Microneedle patch (MNP) technology is designed to simplify the process of vaccine administration; however, depending on its characteristics, MNP technology may provide additional benefits beyond the point-of-use, particularly for vaccine supply chains.
Methods
Using the HERMES modeling software, we examined replacing four routine vaccines – Measles-containing vaccine (MCV), Tetanus toxoid (TT), Rotavirus (Rota) and Pentavalent (Penta) – with MNP versions in the routine vaccine supply chains of Benin, Bihar (India), and Mozambique.
Results
Replacing MCV with an MNP (5 cm3-per-dose, 2-month thermostability, current single-dose price-per-dose) improved MCV availability by 13%, 1% and 6% in Benin, Bihar and Mozambique, respectively, and total vaccine availability by 1% in Benin and Mozambique, while increasing the total cost per dose administered by $0.07 in Benin, $0.56 in Bihar and $0.11 in Mozambique. Replacing TT with an MNP improved TT and total vaccine availability (3% and <1%) in Mozambique only, when the patch was 5 cm3 and 2-months thermostable but increased total cost per dose administered by $0.14. Replacing Rota with an MNP (at 5–15 cm3-per-dose, 1–2 month thermostable) improved Rota and total vaccine availability, but only improved Rota vaccine availability in Bihar (at 5 cm3, 1–2 months thermostable), while decreasing total vaccine availability by 1%. Finally, replacing Penta with an MNP (at 5 cm3, 2-months thermostable) improved Penta vaccine availability by 1–8% and total availability by <1–9%.
Conclusions
An MNP for MCV, TT, Rota, or Penta would need to have a smaller or equal volume-per-dose than existing vaccine formulations and be able to be stored outside the cold chain for a continuous period of at least two months to provide additional benefits to all three supply chains under modeled conditions.}

One of the objective functions minimizes the total transportation cost of the network, while the other one minimizes the total tardiness of returned products from the targeted delivery duration. Although the motivation of our problem emanates from the repair services network of a mobile phone company, proposed models and algorithms can easily be adapted to any type of products. The mobile phone customers are sensitive to delays and thus decreasing the tardiness improves the customer satisfaction. However, due to intense competition among mobile phone companies, the total cost of the repair services network should also be minimized. We analyze the tradeoff between these objective functions and discuss the properties of the Pareto frontier. We are able to find the Pareto frontier exactly for small size networks. For large size networks, we propose a variable neighborhood search (VNS) based heuristic to approximate the Pareto frontier. We perform an application and experiments on the current network of a mobile company and present alternatives to the decision maker.}

Furthermore, for very tight angles between headland path and interior lanes undesired hairpin turns may become necessary due to the limited agility of in-field operating tractors. By minimising the number of interior lanes both detrimental effects can be mitigated. The potential of minimising the number of interior lanes by freeform path fitting is evaluated on 10 non-convex real-world fields including obstacle areas, and compared to the more common technique of fitting straight interior lanes.}

Due to the uneven spatial distribution of customers, the customers close to the depot are distributed by self-owned vehicles (SOVs) with a short route time limit while the far customers are distributed by outsourced vehicles (OSVs) with a long route time limit. Although the divide-and-conquer heuristic procedure is practically used in the examined case, it fails to continuously optimize the solutions in timely manners. The examined cold chain distribution problem is an extension of inventory routing problems (IRPs) while the combination of SOVs and OSVs with different route time limits makes the present solution methods inapplicable. Compared with IRPs, the transportation cost and fuel cost of vehicle cold storage are considered simultaneously; the vehicle travel time limits are assigned depending on the distances from the depot to the visited customers. A formal mixed-integer linear program (MILP) and a descriptive model are developed. Considering the case and its dataset cannot be solved by a MILP solver, a genetic algorithm is developed for exploring good solutions using the descriptive model. The algorithmic tuning and operational parameters are investigated by demonstrative and sensitivity analyzing experiments. The examined case is general in cold chain distribution. The solution method can be extended to scheduling heterogeneous fleets for uneven spatially distributed customers.}

abstract = {The Atlas Copco☆ distribution center in Allen, TX, supplies spare parts and consumables to mining and construction companies across the world. For some customers, packages are shipped in sea containers. Planning how to load the containers is difficult due to several factors: heterogeneity of the packages with respect to size, weight, stackability, positioning and orientation; the set of packages differs vastly between shipments; it is crucial to avoid cargo damage. Load plan quality is ultimately judged by shipping operators. This container loading problem is thus rich with respect to practical considerations. These are posed by the operators and include cargo and container stability as well as stacking and positioning constraints. To avoid cargo damage, the stacking restrictions are modeled in detail. For solving the problem, we developed a two-level metaheuristic approach and implemented it in a decision support system. The upper level is a genetic algorithm which tunes the objective function for a lower level greedy-type constructive placement heuristic, to optimize the quality of the load plan obtained. The decision support system shows load plans on the forklift laptops and has been used for over two years. Management has recognized benefits including reduction of labour usage, lead time, and cargo damage risk.}

On the other hand, evolving information and communication technology offers ample opportunity for more reliable supply chain management practices. Event processing has established itself in many applications in logistics. Although the topic has enjoyed increasing popularity, there is no study taking stock of prior developments and guiding future research. Therefore, a systematic literature review on the topic of event processing in supply chain management from 2005 until the present is undertaken. Extant literature is synthesized and analyzed from technological and supply chain management perspectives to inform scholars and practitioners of existing field developments. Additionally, to guide future scholarly endeavors, a research agenda is derived from promising topics raised in papers and unfulfilled practical requirements. We find that current solutions primarily focus on a limited number of supply chain core processes and a restricted number of supply chain actors. The majority of publications focused on time-temperature sensitive products. Additionally, the domination of road transportation can be observed, while other modes of transport are often ignored in solution implementations. Decision support in terms of object traceability within the supply chain is found in most articles. RFID, typically accompanied by the Electronic Product Code Information Services standard, is the dominant enabling technology. Future research should focus on the topics of standardization, granularity, data sources, and cooperation. Moreover, holistic event processing supported by big data and machine learning techniques could create interfaces with other legacy business intelligence applications. Another promising area includes the exploration of new technologies, i.e. IoT, to enable new smart solutions.}

Based on the conceptualisation, five latent segments of the service are identified, which are labelled as Patrons, Traditionalists, Self-enhancers, Green-lovers and Haters (from the largest to the smallest segment). By doing this, this study contributes to the literature by demonstrating the heterogeneity in consumers' participation patterns of value co-creation in e-commerce last-mile logistics.}

abstract = {After a disaster, often roads are damaged and blocked, hindering accessibility for relief efforts. It is essential to dispatch work teams to restore the blocked roads by clearance or repair operations. With the goal of enabling access between critical locations in the disaster area in shortest time, we propose algorithms that determine the schedule and routes of multiple work teams. We minimize the total latency of reaching the critical locations, where the latency of a location is defined as the time it takes from the start of the operation until its first visit by one of the work teams. Coordination among the teams is needed since some blocked edges might be opened by a certain team and utilized by other teams later on. First, we develop an exact mathematical model that handles the coordination requirement. After observing the intractability of this formulation, we introduce two heuristic methods and a lower bounding procedure. In the first method, we develop a mathematical model based on a novel multi-level network representation that yields solutions with disjoint paths. Given that it does not coordinate the teams, we present a matheuristic based on a cluster-first-route-second approach embedded into a local search algorithm together with an additional coordination step to obtain alternative solutions with higher quality and in a shorter time. We test our heuristics on data sets coming from a real network from the literature (180 instances) and randomly generated ones (640 instances) and observe the superiority of the solutions obtained by incorporation of coordination.}

abstract = {To reduce delivery failures in last mile delivery, several types of delivery options have been proposed in the past twenty years. Still, customer satisfaction is a challenge because a single location is chosen independently of the time at which the customer’s order will be delivered. In addition, delivery at shared locations such as lockers and shops also experience failure due to capacity or opening-time issues at the moment of delivery. To address this issue and foster consolidation at shared delivery locations, we investigate the case where a customer can specify several delivery options together with preference levels and time windows. We define, in this article, the Vehicle Routing Problem with Delivery Options, which integrates several types of delivery locations. It consists of designing a set of routes for a fleet of vehicles that deliver to each customer at one of his/her options during the corresponding time window. These routes should respect capacities at shared locations such as lockers and minimum service level requirements, while minimizing the total routing costs. This problem is solved with a large neighborhood search in which a set partitioning problem is periodically used to reassemble routes. Specific ruin and recreate operators are proposed and combined with numerous operators from the literature. A thorough experimental study was carried out to determine a subset of efficient and complementary operators. The proposed method outperforms existing algorithms from the literature on particular cases of the problem under consideration, such as the vehicle routing problem with roaming delivery locations and the vehicle routing problem with home and roaming delivery locations. New instances are generated and used both to serve as a benchmark and to propose some managerial insight into the vehicle routing problem with alternative delivery options.}

On the other hand, due to the emersion of new technologies and the creation of new business models, the increase of competition level among retailers and the raise of customers expectations, the use of a multi-channel distribution system is nowadays growing. Therefore, the appropriate distribution channel according to the product type and the number of vehicles for the transportation of the products is a significant and important issue in retailing systems. In this regard, in this paper, a mixed-integer programming model for the sustainable distribution network design, considering multi-product, multi-echelon and multi-transportation mode especially third party logistics (3PL), is presented. The economic, environmental, and social objectives are mathematically formulated, where these objectives include: 1) minimizing transportation costs, purchasing vehicles and building warehouses as the first objective, 2) minimizing the amount of carbon dioxide released by transport vehicles and building warehouses, 3) maximizing the number of job opportunities. After linearization of the proposed model, it is solved using the goal programming technique by GAMS software.

The TD-IRP extends the routing component of the IRP by making the travelling time between two locations no longer constant but depending on the departure time. In order to investigate the relevance of considering time-dependent travelling time functions, a set of new benchmark instances based on real-data is assumed. Numerical experiments show that optimising with time-dependent travelling times is cost-efficient, but computationally challenging. Thus, we propose a matheuristic that decomposes the problem, based on the observation of the structure of optimal TD-IRP solutions. The proposed matheuristic defines the set of clients to visit and the quantity to deliver for each period first and solves the routing problem second. Numerical experiments prove it to be very efficient and yield solutions with small gaps to the best lower bounds found. Because it separates the routing problem, the proposed matheuristic opens the possibility to solve the TD-IRP very efficiently by taking advantage of the rich literature on time-dependent routing problems.}

The aim of this study was to answer two key questions: (1) what are the individual and regional determinants of contraceptive use; and (2) what are the effect(s) of individual and regional variables on regional differences in contraceptive use?
Data and method
Multilevel logistic regression was applied on data from the Tanzania Demographic and Health Survey (TDHS) 2010 that allowed us to investigate simultaneously the individual and the regional determinants of contraceptive use and its regional variation.
Results
There was significant variation in contraceptive use, both between population groups as well as between regions. A higher number of children ever born, urban residence, and a non-manual occupation are characteristics associated with higher odds of a woman using contraceptives. Women who talk about family planning with community-based distribution workers and clinic staff also have higher odds of using contraceptives. The regional differences in the shares of women with a secondary education or above explain a significant portion of the regional variance in contraceptive use. Having secondary education and above is related to lower contraceptive use.
Conclusion
This study constitutes a first step towards gaining a better understanding of the macro-level effects on decision-making processes regarding contraceptive use. The regional educational level explains a significant portion of the regional variance in contraceptive use.
Implication statement
An advantage of our study over other studies in Tanzania is that we extended the determinants of contraceptive use to include not only individual-level factors, but also regional-level factors.}

Therefore, closed mode with oil-gas recovery has attracted more attention. In this paper, oil-gas recovery is taken into account from an environmental perspective, incorporated into green vehicle routing problem (GVRP) in refined oil distribution. The main problem involves: I) depict the relationship between costs and benefits of oil-gas recovery, calculate the optimal rate of oil-gas recovery; II) compare the effect on loading-unloading speed in different modes, and confirm the adjusted impact on delivery time. Then, a multi-objective model for GVRP is built, and a NSGA-III algorithm with three layers coding is designed to solve the proposed problem. Finally, the numerical results show that NSGA-III algorithm performs better than others; oil-gas recovery efficiency will be higher with high environmental temperature. In addition, oil-gas recovery can also save delivery time, and the effect of joint optimization in refined oil distribution with oil-gas recovery is better than that of independent optimization.}

The considered models vary with respect to the level of synchronization between the truck and the drones. We mathematically formulate the associated routing problems and prove theoretical bounds on the maximum possible savings that can be obtained by these models compared to truck-only routes. Further, we use a Truck and Drone Routing Algorithm (TDRA), which we use to evaluate these models on four sets of problem instances, as well as two realistic case studies. Our numerical results indicate that a higher level of synchronization considerably leads to reduced customer waiting times. The results of our case study analysis also show that these models can obtain more than 60% customer waiting time reduction compared to a truck-only scenario although the percentage of reduction depends on the values of the underlying parameters of the problem, such as the number of drones, the drone to truck speed ratio, and the drone flight time limit.}

The findings suggest considerable mutual benefits associated with a ‘voluntary overbooking’ policy that emphasizes mutual cooperation between passengers and commercial airlines. The main underlying assumption of the paper is that customers are willing to provide valuations to airlines seeking volunteers for overbooking. The originality of the proposed model is the incorporation of elements of the Rational expectations hypothesis into classical overbooking models gleaned from the literature.}

abstract = {Evaluating the feedstock requirement of biomass-fed district heating systems is important when planning their installation or expansion. Public acceptance, which favors or deters the utilization of biomass, could be impacted by feedstock supply logistics. Feedstock requirement of district heating plants depends on the heat demand from the consumer and biomass quality characteristics, which vary over time. Previous studies on utilizing biomass for district heating mostly assumed average feedstock quality characteristics and aggregated heat demand values without considering their daily variations. While using average quality characteristics provides the average feedstock requirement of the plant, the actual requirement may vary significantly from the average value when daily variations in quality characteristics are considered. Not including these variations could lead to infeasibilities in meeting the heat demand of the plant. This study assesses the feedstock requirement of expanding a district heating plant considering daily variations in biomass quality characteristics and heat demand. A Microsoft Excel-based simulation model with one-year planning horizon and daily time steps is developed for the assessment. The costs and CO2-eq emissions of using different feedstock types are evaluated with and without trucking limitations. The developed model is applied to a real biomass-fed district heating plant at the University of British Columbia, Canada. The capacity of the heating plant is planned to be expanded from 6 MW to 18 MW. Three feedstock types, namely, wood residues, pellets and briquettes, and a mix of them are assessed. The results suggest that when enough trucking capacity is available, the plant would receive 2–9 truckloads of wood residues or 1–3 truckloads of pellets/briquettes. The expansion could reduce the total CO2 emissions by about 11,000 tonnes compared to those emitted by the 6 MW (current) biomass-fed heating capacity and natural gas (for a total of 18 MW) when sufficient biomass is available to the plant. However, when trucking is limited, using only wood residues could cause biomass shortage for almost half of the year and result in more emissions due to natural gas consumption. Utilizing energy dense feedstock, such as pellets and briquettes, could mitigate the effects of limited trucking, though, the total fuel cost could increase by 76% and 58%, respectively, compared to using only wood residues. Using a mix of wood residues and pellets/briquettes could achieve a reasonable trade-off between emission reduction and unit fuel cost.}

abstract = {Urban freight by motorized transport poses a threat to the sustainable development of modern city centers through extensive emissions of greenhouse gasses, contributing to congestion, and increasing the risk of traffic accidents. In addition, further densification of European city centers demands an effective use of urban areas. As urban planners are shifting their focus from automobiles to cyclists and pedestrians, the cargo bike has been used as an alternative to motorized vehicles for urban freight in several European cities. Flexible use of cargo bikes permits efficient delivery of goods in congested urban areas, with zero emissions. Cargo bikes are also becoming a part of the city logistics in northern countries like Norway, where they are prone to adverse weather conditions, low temperatures and roads covered with snow and ice. The Armadillo, a four-wheeled cargo bike from the Swedish company Velove, was used in Norway for its first winter in 2018/19. Based on the lack of research on how cargo bikes operate in northern climates and a hypothesis that cargo bikes operate with less efficiency on winter roads than in summer conditions, the two following research questions were formulated: 1. What challenges and obstacles are cargo bikes facing on winter roads? 2. How can we facilitate and ensure efficient operation of cargo bikes in northern climates? To answer these questions, two methodological approaches were applied. First, observations and GPS-tracking of a working cargo cyclist were performed on winter roads in Trondheim, Norway. Second, seven qualitative interviews were conducted among experienced cargo cyclists in several Norwegian cities. Calculated velocities for the observed cargo cyclist showed that the average velocity in general was 27.6% lower for winter trips than spring trips. The observations and the interviews show that even though snow, ice, slush and low temperatures reduces the cargo bikes efficiency, using cargo bikes for urban delivery on winter roads is fully feasible. The design of the Armadillo, sufficient clothing and good planning solves many of the challenges faced by cargo bikes on winter roads. In addition, a cargo bike with more durable parts, larger wheels and better illumination, as well as an increase in the amount of bicycle lanes, would further facilitate the efficient operation of cargo bikes in northern climates. The biggest challenge concerning the use of cargo bikes for urban delivery in northern countries, seems to be urban consolidation centers or micro depots as an essential prerequisite for effective operation. Such centers would also provide the cargo cyclists a warm place to take breaks and to load, charge and maintain the cargo bikes. The findings in this study are supposed to provide further knowledge for urban planners, municipalities, road owners and logistic companies on how to ensure efficient operation of cargo bikes on winter roads.}

The HCSPSPDTW is a bi-objective problem where the traveled time and distance should be minimized. In this paper, we present a hierarchical approach for solving the HCSPSPDTW: the inner optimization problem solved by the k-means++ clustering algorithm, asks for finding the closest visits in terms of distance to avoid long travels. The outer problem is a Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) modeled by a mixed-integer mathematical model and solved using Tabu Search (TS) metaheuristic. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, this study used some modified test problems from Solomon’s benchmark. The obtained results show that the proposed approach was able to generate better solutions than similar algorithms while using less computation time. For instance, the proposed approach outperforms other algorithms by generating less routing cost for 83.93% instances, less used vehicles for 98.73% instances, and by spending less computational time for 98.7% instances. The proposed HCSPSPDTW solving approach is the solver module of a decision support system that will help Home Health Care companies to make appropriate decisions on scheduling their daily plans which will lead to can lead to a significant reduction of transportation costs and improvement of staff satisfaction.}

However, this advantage has to be weighed against the losses associated with repairing or replacing a still functional component earlier than required. An integer linear optimization model analyzes this trade-off, first from an environmental then from an economic perspective. This model is applied using the two most common pallet types as case studies: 48- by 40-inch stringer and block pallets. Different handling and loading scenarios are considered. The impact of transportation distance on the efficiency of preemptive policies is explored through a sensitivity analysis. Results show the positive impact of preemptive remanufacturing on costs and CO2-equivalent emissions in all scenarios, with larger benefits in good handling or light loading scenarios.}

Additionally, we discuss the joint use of objective functions that are relevant in the context of some humanitarian logistics problems. We apply the general modeling frameworks proposed to the so-called stochastic shelter site location problem. This is a problem emerging in the context of preventive disaster management.

Currently, there is a shortage of facilities that enable safe and secure parking of trucks and that also provide a minimum level of services to cater for the social well-being of the drivers. By establishing a denser network of safe and secure truck parking areas with a clear definition of security levels, it is possible to tackle these problems in tandem.}

abstract = {The persistence of dhow shipping around the Arabian Peninsula is puzzling nowadays, since almost every commodity can be carried easily and cheaply through the global network of container shipping lines (Song and Panayides, 2015). Yet, dhow shipping is still active in the region, not only for local trade but also for long range trade such as between East Africa and Indian or even Sri Lanka. In the absence of an available database on dhow trade, this article uses port data to deduce the way dhows differentiate their services from liner and bulk shipping to find a place in maritime transport. Using data provided by the Djibouti Port and Free Zone Authority (DPFZA) on dhows’ stopovers during the 2014–2018 period, this article shows that dhows perform a taxi-like on-demand tramping service to supply coastal retailers with consumer goods that are not carried by liner shipping. Through the particular case of dhows in Djibouti, the article sheds light on the part played by transport vectors as norm interfaces to distribute standardised consumer goods to populations in developing countries.}

When a UAV flies to conduct monitoring tasks, it does not have to fly at a fixed speed; instead, it should fly at lower speeds over objects of higher concerns and vice versa. This paper addresses the UAV planning problem with a focus on optimizing the speed profile. We propose an infinite-dimensional optimization model for the problem and transform the model into a linear programming formulation based on characteristics of the problem. Our case study shows the managerial insight that the UAV flies at low speeds on important segments of the path and at its highest speeds on less-important segments. This means more durable batteries should be designed for drones that need to carry out elaborated monitoring tasks. This finding further provides guidance for drone users when purchasing and renting drones.}

In the proposed bi-objective model, the first objective is the total logistics cost, including the fixed costs of the opened depots and leased vehicles, as well as the cost of fuel consumption and carbon emissions, and the second is to minimize the amount of quality degradation that aims at improving clients’ satisfaction and maintain product freshness. The cargos of clients are classified into three types: general, refrigerated, and frozen cargos. Since the presented problem is NP-hard, a novel multi-objective hyperheuristic (MOHH) was proposed to obtain the Pareto solutions. In this framework, three selection strategies were developed to improve the performance of MOHH, that is, random simple, choice function, and FRR-MAB (fitness rate rank based multi-armed bandit), and three acceptance criteria using the decomposition approaches in MOEA/D were also developed, namely penalty-based boundary intersection, Tchebycheff, and modified Tchebycheff approaches. Extensive experiments were provided to verify the efficiency of the proposed algorithms and assessed the effects of algorithm parameters on the Pareto front. The results showed that the efficiency of the proposed algorithm outperforms several existing well-known multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEA).}

The generalized costs are calculated using a road and rail transport network model, enabling potential hinterlands of terminals in close competition to be delimited, rather than port hinterlands as is more common in the literature. The mathematical model is used in a case study on the consequences of building a new terminal in the port of Lisbon and closing down an existing terminal, implying a terminal relocation between river banks. The model shows that this relocation has significant implications in the delimitation of container terminal potential hinterlands across southern Portugal. Conclusions and policy recommendations regarding the consequences of such relocation are given in terms of relative competitiveness of the different terminals and suitability of the relocation.}

It combines multi-objective optimization with the analytic network process to take into account sustainability requirements of a supplier portfolio configuration. To integrate ‘risk’ into the supplier selection problem, we develop a multi-objective optimization model based on the investment portfolio theory introduced by Markowitz. The proposed model is a non-standard portfolio selection problem with four objectives: (1) minimizing the purchasing costs, (2) selecting the supplier portfolio with the highest logistics service, (3) minimizing the supply risk, and (4) ordering as much as possible from those suppliers with outstanding sustainability performance. The optimization model, which has three linear and one quadratic objective function, is solved by an algorithm that analytically computes a set of efficient solutions and provides graphical decision support through a visualization of the complete and exactly-computed Pareto front (a posteriori approach). The possibility of computing all Pareto-optimal supplier portfolios is beneficial for decision makers as they can compare all optimal solutions at once, identify the trade-offs between the criteria, and study how the different objectives of supplier portfolio configuration may be balanced to finally choose the composition that satisfies the purchasing company's strategy best. The approach has been applied to a real-world supplier portfolio configuration case to demonstrate its applicability and to analyze how the consideration of sustainability requirements may affect the traditional supplier selection and purchasing goals in a real-life setting.}

abstract = {In this paper we address the Length Constrained K-Drones Rural Postman Problem (LC K-DRPP). This is a continuous optimization problem where a fleet of homogeneous drones have to jointly service (traverse) a set of (curved or straight) lines of a network. Unlike the vehicles in classical arc routing problems, a drone can enter a line through any of its points, service a portion of that line, exit through another of its points, then travel directly to any point on another line, and so on. Moreover, since the range of the drones is restricted, the length of each route is limited by a maximum distance. Some applications for drone arc routing problems include inspection of pipelines, railway or power transmission lines and traffic monitoring. To deal with this problem, LC K-DRPP instances are digitized by approximating each line by a polygonal chain with a finite number of points and allowing drones to enter and exit each line only at these points. In this way we obtain an instance of the Length Constrained K-vehicles Rural Postman Problem (LC K-RPP). If the number of points used to discretize the lines is large, the LC K-RPP instance can be extremely large and, hence, very difficult to solve optimally. Even heuristic algorithms can fail in providing feasible solutions in reasonable computing times. An alternative is to generate smaller LC K-RPP instances by approximating each line with few but “significant” segments. We present a formulation and some valid inequalities for the LC K-RPP. Based on this, we have designed and implemented a branch-and-cut algorithm for its solution. Moreover, in order to be capable of providing good solutions for large LC K-RPP instances, we propose a matheuristic algorithm that begins by finding good solutions for the LC K-RPP instance obtained by approximating each line by a single segment. Then, to find better solutions, some promising intermediate points are sequentially incorporated. Extensive computational experiments to assess the performance of both algorithms are performed on several sets of instances from the literature.}

The approach we have devised is simple, generic and does not depend on field data collection or restricted-access data (such as satellite images, commercial databases, etc.), which can be either too expensive for larger areas or simply unavailable. We also show how maps can be built to represent such measures in an intuitive manner that allows the visual comparison of different areas and cities. Its practical utilization is demonstrated by a case study comprising busy central areas of six large cities in three different continents: Latin America, United States and Europe. The results and insights we present can help different stakeholders, from carriers to local authorities understand the difficulties of a new delivery operation as well as identify more critical areas that may require more attention or some intervention.}

The optimization literature on cross-docking has mostly focused on the modeling and solution of problems considering a single cross-docking facility. Networks with multiple cross-docks remain rather unexplored and the few papers that deal with the problem do this by simplifying the geometry of the goods. We intend to shorten this gap by proposing a mixed-integer linear programming model for optimizing distribution and delay costs for the transportation of goods in open networks with multiple cross-docks considering the three-dimensional aspects of the cargo. Also, we propose a logic-based Benders decomposition strategy which allow for the solution of larger instances when compared with those that can be handled by a branch-and-cut MIP solver. Experiments showed that the decomposition can handle instances with two times more nodes and five times more boxes than a direct use of the solver. Also, the framework is flexible enough to accommodate other features of practical cases.}

In order to generate the greatest benefits from digitalization while improving healthcare delivery, this article sets out a roadmap for implementing technologies. Unlike previous studies that focused on the entire supply chain or had been limited to patient flow, this study adopts the perspective of the hospital as a central launching point for digitalization initiatives. The roadmap, which involves both internal and external digitalization trajectories, is based on a research methodology that combines observations with an umbrella review of literature. This methodology enables us to capture the research challenges associated with the healthcare supply chain and show how digitalization initiatives can address them. The digitalization proposals put forward are structured in terms of priority and centered on hospitals. These proposals can help managers make improvements to the supply chain and also clinical flows.}

As one path, the research on the direct reuse of construction components focusses on strategies for designing buildings for disassembly in the end-of-life stage. This is of particular importance because it can reduce the environmental impact of the construction industry. The recently published ISO 20887 also advocates to design buildings for disassembly and to use standard-sized components. However, to the authors’ knowledge the role of standardisation in this process remains unexplored. Therefore, in this paper the evolution of standardisation is studied in order to identify the drivers for standardisation and currently available standards that aid and support the claims of the ISO 20887. This study concludes that most standards are introduced from an economic, rather than an environmental point of view. Also, ISO 20887 seems to be the first actual standard addressing the idea of reusing building components. Through an integrative discussion of the available types of construction standards, the problem areas obstructing the required further standardisation are identified: protectionism of contractors whom perceive standardisation as a threat, protectionism of manufacturers whom are reluctant to change the organisation structure, and designers whom seem least aware of the need to implement the circular economy in the construction sector. Finally, a corresponding trajectory is proposed for future standardisation to tackle these problem areas and to actually perform its role as an essential enabler for circular Reuse in the construction sector.}

Thus, several bio-inspired approaches for multiple-entities optimization have been proposed in the literature for various limited applications, e.g., drone coordination, mobile robot formation maintenance. In all these strategies, the entities must plan their path and control their movements while coordinating their behavior w.r.t. the other members, and they must avoid collisions, so the task could be very difficult in the unstructured environments present in future manufacturing plants and goods transportation. Future applications of these bio-inspired techniques for coordination and control of AXVs include large warehouses, manufacturing, logistics, last-mile delivery, etc. The AXVs could be grouped to carry larger goods or they can act as swarm members when they do not have a common goal, but they must interact while they move to complete the allocated tasks and intersect their paths with the paths of other entities. As such, this paper illustrates the concept of applying such bio-inspired coordination and control techniques for the development of future manufacturing and goods transportation, a discussion being carried out regarding the advantages and disadvantages of several techniques for their use in specific applications.}

Inefficient routing increases operation time which lead to negative impacts including: increased labor cost, crop loss, and unnecessary hours put on expensive machinery. In addition to increased time, inefficient routing also increases the amount of unnecessary in-field travel, which increases fuel cost and the possibility of soil compaction. The goal of this research was to implement an optimization routine that could determine the most efficient harvest pattern for row crop harvesters in actual fields. A Genetic Algorithm was developed that was able to optimize the harvest route and provide a feasible solution in real field conditions. The algorithm was validated using spatial yield data from three fields and the optimized travel path reduced the non-working in-field travel between 13.8 and 31.5 percent.}

abstract = {Multi-load Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) has been proposed for a while, but the advantage of its application is still not fully understood today. In order to fill this knowledge gap, a novel integrated model of a multi-load AGV system is developed in this paper by using an advanced form of Petri Nets, namely Coloured Petri Nets (CPNs), to simulate the operation of the AGV system in various scenarios. The study reported in this paper is focused to answer a few key questions, i.e. whether system performance can be continuously improved by increasing the load capacity of the multi-load AGVs; if not, whether there is an optimal load capacity of the multi-load AGV for a particular system; and whether the multi-load AGVs can still work well in a system with flexible loading and unloading points. The research results have shown that the efficiency of the AGV system can be improved by increasing the load capacity at the beginning, but the effectiveness of such an approach will decrease when the load capacity increases above a certain value. In other words, an AGV system may not perform better after using a larger capacity of multi-load AGV and there must be an optimal load capacity of the multi-load AGV for a specific AGV system. In addition, it is found that a system with flexible loading and unloading points can perform better after using a multi-load AGV.}

Past knowledge related to performance indicator are generally qualitative and imprecise. Existing humanitarian performance measurement systems are largely theoretical and do not consider qualitative and imprecise information in their assessment of humanitarian relief operations. This paper aims to address a practical approach to the performance measurement of humanitarian operations by recognizing the need for multi-dimensional performance evaluation while dealing with imprecision and uncertainty in evaluation processes. A hierarchical multi-stage Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) was developed to address imprecise and uncertain performance indicators. Performance indicators were clustered into four Balanced Scorecard (BSC) type categories. A prototype was developed using MATLAB toolbox. The FIS scheme was tested and validated by practitioners from leading international humanitarian organizations in Malaysia. The scheme facilitated performance analysis and provided insights into operational areas that need further improvements. The proposed FIS scheme enable decision-makers to address imprecise and fuzzy information more objectively.}

SR for the product life cycle is a concept that represents a paradigm shift in developing countries, like Brazil, placing SWM as a national priority. This concept extends the responsibility for SWM beyond manufacturers, including other stakeholders such as consumers and public authorities. These multiple agents with different points of view make the definition of responsibilities a complex task. Thus, the model was developed in three phases: Pre-negotiation, Negotiation and Post-negotiation. In the first two phases, a multi-methodology to structure the problem, stimulate collaboration, integrate stakeholder perspectives and preferences into a learning process was proposed. The responsibilities were defined through a multi-attribute evaluation. A Pareto-efficient decision for all stakeholders, simultaneously, was achieved. Finally, a strong engagement between stakeholders, and an effective commitment to the viability of SR was achieved.}

abstract = {Devastating effects of disasters and global crises on people increase the importance of humanitarian logistics studies for pre and post-disaster stages. Location planning of Temporary Medical Centers/field hospitals is one of the most important problems for disaster response. We aimed to determine the location and number of temporary medical centers in case of disasters by considering the locations of the existing hospitals, casualty classification (triage), capacities of medical centers and possibilities of damage to the roads and hospitals. Besides, we aimed to assign different casualty classes to these medical centers for emergency medical response by considering the distances between disaster areas and medical centers. For this purpose, a two-stage stochastic programming model was developed. The proposed model finds an optimal TMC location solution while minimizing the total setup cost of the TMCs and the expected total transportation cost by considering casualty types, demand, possibilities of damage to the roads and hospitals, and distance between the disaster areas and the medical centers. In the model, α-reliability constraints for the expected number of unassigned casualties were also used. Besides, the model was reformulated without triage, in order to understand the impact of casualty classification on the solution of the problem. We performed a real case study for the district of Kartal expected to be widely damaged in the possible Istanbul earthquake, and a sensitivity analysis was made. The analysis of the results offer some managerial insights associated with the number of temporary medical centers’ needed, their locations, and additional hospital capacity requirements.}

This paper surveys the scientific literature on all kinds of fully-automated conveyor-based sorting systems from an operational research perspective. We describe the wide range of applications and their different sorting systems, define their joint decision problems to be solved when designing and operating a sorter, review the literature, and identify future research challenges.}

We complement the insights from the literature review with those from a set of interviews of humanitarian practitioners and HO suppliers of products and services. This allows us to shed light into real practices of humanitarian procurement, and the critical challenges and dilemmas they face.

Freight companies are also increasingly using cargo bicycles for last mile logistics. Yet little is known on the risks of injuries and collisions for commercial cyclists. Using 36 interviews of commercial cyclists, employers, contractors and entrepreneurs in the Montréal metropolitan area, Canada, we develop a framework for occupational safety factors related to risks of near collisions, collisions and injuries for different types of cyclist workers. The framework presents 21 factors organized in 4 large categories that may be associated with safety and health issues: individual characteristics and traits (experience, risk-taking behavior), work type and working conditions, exposure levels, and external factors (not related to workers or companies). Workers have different backgrounds and working conditions, use different bicycle types and other equipment and are accordingly potentially exposed to distinct and varying levels of risk. Many injuries are reported. Personal health issues including repetitive stress injuries, mental exertion and food intake emerged from interviews as a potentially risk-enhancing feature. Commission-based work performed in crowded business districts during peak traffic periods are likely the three highest road-related injury risk given exposure levels. Experience of cyclists and the promotion of safe practices by employers are key protective factors, but pay structure may be the single most important features to improve the safety of workers. Because using bicycles as work tools is likely to grow over time, it is important to understand how city planning, work organization, industry regulation, and education of workers and employers may reduce risks to commercial cyclists on the roads. The framework can serve future inferential studies.}

abstract = {This paper discusses an optimization model for handling the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic based on food supply network through regional food hubs (RFHs) under uncertainty. To this end, uncertainty is assumed in the demand and production data. During the Pandemic COVID-19 period, uncertainty has increased and the food supply chain system has changed. Thus, a new configuration of the food supply network requires analysis. In this paper, the concept of RFH is introduced to connect producers in rural areas and customers in urban areas. This paper determines the location and capacity of RFHs, the food supply network, the sum of maximum food supplies, and minimum logistics cost. This is done via a Multi-Objective Many-to-Many Location-Routing Problem model. Furthermore, since the conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic is uncertain, robust optimization is employed to handle uncertainties. During the current pandemic, red zones are defined to indicate the severity of the pandemic in a region. In this paper, the numerical experiment is considered for three scenarios: when a region is in large-scale social distancing, partial social distancing, or normal conditions. This social distancing situation is based on the defined red zones. The optimal food supply network is obtained for the three scenarios and the best scenario among the three is identified.}

The first echelon aims at transferring goods from a warehouse to a (single) city hub located in the city center. The second echelon, managed with a fleet of environmentally friendly vehicles, delivers goods to final customers, from the city hub. The two echelons are synchronized in time but also with regards to the capacity of the city hub. As far as we know, this is the first study considering the latter issue in the context of two-echelon distribution. To deal with the synchronization while optimizing the distribution, we propose a three-phase heuristic solution approach. At first, our approach optimizes the distribution for the second echelon. Then, it manages the synchronization. Finally, it optimizes the distribution for the first echelon. Population-based metaheuristics and integer programs are used. Results show the effectiveness of the method and permit to derive managerial insights on the distribution.}

Using WCO as raw material in biodiesel production is an effective disposal method. In this study, we focus on designing an efficient WCO collection network, in which households deposit their WCO into the bins to be placed at several collection centers (CCs), which are then regularly collected by capacitated vehicles. We study the problem of determining (i) the number and location of the CCs, (ii) the assignment of households to the CCs, respecting a certain coverage distance threshold, (iii) the number of bins to place at each CC, and (iv) the vehicle routes navigating between the biodiesel facility and CCs to minimize the sum of fixed cost of opening CCs and placing bins at each CC and routing cost. To solve the proposed location-routing problem, we develop a novel matheuristic based on Variable Neighborhood Search, which incorporates an integer programming model to determine the bin allocation and assignment decisions. We evaluate the solution performance of different variants of the proposed algorithm by performing an extensive computational study on a set of hypothetical and case instances. The results show that the proposed matheuristic provides superior solutions with respect to benchmark algorithms.}

Freight is either transported by hire and reward carriers or the business producing the product, known as ancillary or own account transport. As ancillary transport is not a core function of the business it is common that this task consists of small and moderate loads transported across urban areas mostly in small to medium sized trucks, that are often empty on the return trip. This paper describes how analysis and modelling was used to design and conduct an evaluation of a shared network. In the model, high capacity freight vehicles operate frequently between Key Freight Areas (KFAs). Hubs are created at KFAs to transfer and tranship loads between vehicles to transport goods from shippers to receivers. The model investigates the potential for shared networks of general freight in urban areas to reduce congestion and lower transport costs.}
