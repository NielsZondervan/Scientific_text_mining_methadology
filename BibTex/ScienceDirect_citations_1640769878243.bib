abstract = {Pressure from legislation and customers has motivated companies to consider reverse logistics (RL) in their operations. Since it is a complex procedure that requires an adequate system, the recent trend consists in outsourcing RL to third-party reverse logistics providers (3PRLPs). This paper provides the background of sustainable triple bottom line theory with focus on economic, environmental, and social aspects under 3PRL concerns. The relevant sustainability criteria are used in a case study conducted in cooperation with an Indian automotive remanufacturing company. To select the most preferred service provider, we use a hybrid method combining a variant of ELECTRE I accounting for the effect of reinforced preference, the revised Simos procedure, and Stochastic Multi-criteria Acceptability Analysis. The incorporated approach exploits all parameters of an outranking model compatible with the incomplete preference information of the Decision Maker. In particular, it derives the newly defined kernel acceptability and membership indices that can be interpreted as a support given to the selection of either a particular subset of alternatives or a single option. The proposed ELECTRE-based method enriches the spectrum of multiple criteria decision analysis approaches that can be used to effectively approach the problem of the 3PRLP selection. As indicated by the extensive review presented in the paper, this application field was so far dominated by Analytic Hierarchy Process and TOPSIS, whose weaknesses can be overcome by applying the outranking methods.}

abstract = {This paper addresses a two-stage stochastic model for eco-efficient reverse logistics network design (RLND). The goal of this optimization model is to maximize the expected profit and minimize landfilling activities to give more incentive for materials recycling. The model considers a source separation option that allows the separation of the collected materials at an early stage of the reverse logistics channel. The quantity of waste generated and the recycling rates at the collection centers are uncertain due to the variable quality of the collected batches. We solved the model using the combination of a Sampling Average Approximation procedure and the ε-constraint method. An application is illustrated through the case study of wood waste recycling from the construction, renovation, and demolition (CRD) industry in the province of Quebec in Canada. This research reveals that the source separation strategy provides better control of the impact of uncertainties, not only for the economic performance but also from an environmental perspective. The results highlight the necessity to evaluate the interaction between environmental policies to avoid conflicting objectives. Finally, the case study demonstrates the complexity of the reverse logistics network in the CRD industry and the challenge to achieve eco-efficiency under uncertainty.}

abstract = {Over the last two decades, the diagnosis of bankruptcy firms has become extremely important to business owners, banks, governments, securities investors, and economic stakeholders, in order to hedge against financial damage. This topic has attracted the attention of many computer scientists, as well as the financial sector. In computer science, a predictive model will be developed to analyse a firm's financial statements to predict its fate in the future based on the existing bankruptcy dataset. Many machine learning models have been developed to predict bankruptcy using specific datasets. This manuscript proposes a fast and accurate approach that utilises GPU-based extreme gradient boosting machine using squared logistics loss (SqLL) denoted by gXGBS for bankruptcy forecasting on both scenarios, including an imbalanced dataset (Korean bankruptcy dataset [KRBDS]) and two balanced datasets (USA bankruptcy dataset [USABDS] and Japanese bankruptcy dataset [JPNBDS]). To improve the performance of this prediction task, the study uses a custom loss function, namely SqLL, for an extreme gradient boosting machine to propose XGBS algorithm. Then, this study employs a GPU-based implementation of a decision tree construction algorithm (gDTC) to accelerate the processing time of XGBS. This is called a gXGBS algorithm. In addition, we also utilise a histogram-based tree construction algorithm using multi-GPU (gHTC), an approximation algorithm, for a gXGBS algorithm that will propose the third algorithm, namely gXGBS_hist, for the large datasets. The comprehensive experiments were conducted on three experimental datasets to evaluate the proposed approaches. The experimental results indicate that our proposed approaches outperform the state-of-the-art machine learning approaches for bankruptcy forecasting in terms of geometric mean (G-mean), Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) and processing time for all experimental datasets.}

The framework distinguishes between the objective of the group and the objectives of the individual partners in the coalition. Although the importance of the individual partner interests is often acknowledged in the literature, the proposed solution framework is the first to include these objectives directly into the objective function of the optimisation model. The solution framework is applied to a collaborative variant of the clustered vehicle routing problem, for which we also create a set of benchmark instances. We find that by only considering a global coalition objective, the obtained solution is often suboptimal for some partners in the coalition. Providing a set of high quality alternative solutions that are Pareto efficient with respect to the partner objectives, gives additional insight in the sensitivity of a solution, which can support the decision making process. Our computational results therefore acknowledge the importance of including the individual partner objectives into the optimisation procedure.}

A statistical evaluation of results was performed as a part of subsequent statements in the expectations and perception section along with their comparative analysis intended to determine the size of gaps. The results have been generalized for five dimensions of service quality. Unweighted and weighted SERVQUAL results were calculated. Expectations regarding the quality of services provided by the researched operator were higher than the actually obtained quality level – this concerned all aspects and dimensions of service quality under evaluation. The obtained results were the basis to determine the order which some improvement actions were undertaken in. When it comes to the examined operator, their service quality dimensions which must be improved first of all, is reliability, then tangible, assurance, responsiveness, while empathy gained the best scoring from the "worst" dimensions. It was suggested to take measures intended to improve the quality of services provided by the researched operator in relation to the verified five dimensions of quality.

In Canada, the province of Ontario has enacted regulations regarding the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Recycling program. The objective of this study is to develop a novel scenario-based robust possibilistic approach to optimize and configure an electronic reverse logistics network by considering the uncertainty associated with fixed and variable costs, the quantity of demand and return, and the quality of returned products. A Monte Carlo simulation is utilized to analyze the performance of our proposed model. Then, ANOVA test is conducted to statistically verify our model using the simulation results. The mathematical model is extended to the multi-objective optimization by maximising the environmental compliance of the third parties. The efficient solutions of the multi-objective model are computed using the two-phase fuzzy compromise approach. To provide a comprehensive assessment of the problem under investigation, we provide sensitivity analyses on the impact of different factors (e.g., recovery rates, capacity of facilities) on the total expected profit. Several interesting results were obtained, including the fact that increasing the capacity of facilities does not automatically translate into higher profits. Furthermore, by comparing the efficient solutions of deterministic and robust modes, we illustrate the impact of robustness price on the multi-objective model. The application of the proposed model is illustrated using a network in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) in Canada.}

For each case, specific service innovation practices are documented and coded according to the service innovation framework adapted from previous research. The results show that service innovation is indeed important impetus for cold chain LSPs' superior competitiveness, even though previous research suggested that firms in this industry are not as innovative as others. Cold chain LSPs in emerging markets tend to innovate in providing new value-added and differential service offerings to specific customers, industries or regions.

The problem considers different carbon emission control policies with heterogeneous transportation fleets and allows for lost sales. The aim is to select the optimal carbon control policy with optimal production, inventory, and delivery quantities. The proposed model is formulated as both a deterministic and a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer programming problem. The proposed formulations are demonstrated through two case studies, a simulated reverse logistics supply chain and an actual home appliances production supply chain with remanufacturing options. Sensitivity analyses are conducted to test for the effect of different parameters on the optimal solution.

RL, which offers the possibility to give a second life to end-of-life (EOL) products, has attracted attention from both producers and scientific researchers. Meanwhile reverse flow integration in the supply chain has given rise to many optimization problems. Most of these problems are proving to be difficult to solve; by the theory of complexity and experience from computational experiments, they are classified as difficult and complex to solve through exact methods or simulations. Instead scientists used a strong and efficient class of methods called meta-heuristics to solve them. In this paper, we review the previously published papers on reverse logistics and classify them on the basis of the meta-heuristic approaches adopted and the problem context of the reverse supply chain. Further, we discuss the power and flexibility of these methods for solving a set of RL problems. Finally, we discuss some future opportunities and directions for practitioners and researchers.}

In general, the amount of returned product in a reverse logistics network is highly uncertain, and the ELV market in Turkey is no exception to this. For that purpose, this study aims developing a fuzzy mixed integer location-allocation model for reverse logistic network of ELVs conforming to the existing directives in Turkey. Accordingly, this study uses a novel approach and assumes that ELV supply in the network is uncertain. The merit of the proposed mathematical model is proved on a real world scenario addressing the reverse logistics design problem for ELVs generated in metropolitan area of Istanbul. The network generated specifies that recycling process is not profitable under the existing circumstances with the given level of supplied ELV and the returned product records per capita in Istanbul are far beyond the EU averages. Consequently, sensitivity analyses question the reliability of the obtained results.}

Therefore, it prompts the necessity to track and trace goods, for ensuring the control and management of the different logistics operations. In port terminals, tracking and tracing cargo is primitive for smooth and flexible services. Technologies such as RFID, GPS, RTLS, etc. are widely used for monitoring cargo flow in the logistics chain. In light of this, this paper proposes a novel architecture based on auto-ID technologies like QRcode, Barcode, Magnetic card ID to support real-time tracking of vehicles in a RoRo terminal and provide their stay time as well as processing time in each service. The modeled system aims to solve dynamic logistics process management problems, monitor rolling cargo, identify similar behavior as well as increase traffic flow and reduce check-in time. Design/approach: The proposed architecture provides a real-time tracking capability. It tracks a vehicle in each area of the terminal through a portal that identify it using a barcode, a QRcode or a magnetic ID card. The system performs the process logic checking/reasoning and provides process knowledge support. Originality: The proposed architecture is a novel approach which leverages the logistics performance in RoRo terminals and facilitates the tracking of vehicles and provides a real-time knowledge support on processes for those who handle logistics operations.}

Changes in demand determine corrective decisions and associated costs, such as advance decisions on delay or cancellation of contracts in order to meet storage and logistics constraints. We present a multi-stage stochastic programming model for the problem. Uncertainty is modeled as a discrete event tree of scenarios. Three heuristic strategies, relax and fix, rolling horizon and scenario aggregation, are proposed and applied to three case studies. Results show that when delay or cancellation decisions are taken in advance of the reception period, the relax and fix strategy performs better in terms of quality of the solution and processing time. The methodology allows to model relevant aspects of the problem and proposes a robust procurement decision that hedges uncertainty and establishes corrective actions.}

This paper therefore seeks to consider the designing and planning of a green forward and reverse logistics network, through a mixed integer linear programming model. The model is applied to a multi-stage, multi-product, and multi-objective problem whereby the first objective is to minimize the cost of operations, processes, transportation, and fixed costs of the establishment. The second objective is to minimize the amount of CO2 emissions based on the gram unit, while the third is to optimize the number of machines in the production line. For validation, the model is applied to the home appliance industry through several test problems. In terms of the solution methodology, an epsilon-constraint method is developed as the area of optimization in order to obtain a set of Pareto solutions. Finally, sensitivity analysis is conducted to understand the effects of changes in the demand, cost, and rate of return of the used product, on the objective function values.}

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a conceptual framework for classifying operations management-related issues for returnable transport items (RTI). RTI closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) issues are classified into three categories. Our proposal is based on a global literature review in the field of CLSC and reverse logistics (RL), with a specific focus on transport items reuse. We also derive our work from observations made in the automotive industry. The motivation for dealing with this topic is that more and more companies are adopting RTIs in their supply chain, and despite the growing attention that CLSC and RL research have gained during the last years, the focus is still more oriented toward remanufacturing issues. The objectives of this paper are twofold. Firstly, to provide practitioners with a clear vision on different issues that arise when implementing a RTI system from an operations management point of view, and secondly, to give suggestions to researchers regarding existing gaps that still need to be filled in this field.}

The problem is to minimise total logistics cost by choosing shipment size, vehicle size and reorder point subject to constraints on vehicle size and annual transport capacity. An analytical solution in all variables except the reorder point is derived, reducing the cost minimisation problem to a well-behaved problem in one dimension only. Different parts of transport costs influence the solution differently: Some act like ordering costs, some like holding costs and some have no influence on the solution. The solution exhibits economies of scale at all levels of optimal shipment size. Examples with real data show that model calibration for an entire population of firms is feasible at the firm level, and that the model produces reasonable results.}

abstract = {The cost-effective and high-quality city logistics service is a key for the success of e-commerce enterprises. Synchronization (sync) is emerging as a typical yet challenging requirement, which asks for simultaneous deliveries of multiple products to the same customer. This paper is among the first to model the sync constraints with sliding time windows (STW). STW is a special type of time window of which only the window size is defined. Unlike traditional time windows, the start and end time of STW could be adjusted earlier or later, so long as their difference equals to the pre-defined window size. In this sense, the STW is a time constraint with partially unknown factors. Such flexibility of STW can greatly improve the efficiency of vehicle tours, because customers could be served in a more flexible sequence decided by the transporter. A novel divide and conquer based algorithm is developed to tackle the proposed problem with partially unknown time constraints. The values for STWs will dynamically be determined during the algorithm. Numerical studies show that by modelling sync requirements with STW, transportation cost could be saved as much as in half. We also carry out sensitivity analyses on the key factors such as promised sync level to customers and the complexity of online orders.}

Compared with dilute acid pretreatment based biorefinery, DLCA(ch) based biorefinery showed much lower feedstock logistics cost, and the savings in feedstock logistics almost offset the DLC(ch) pretreatment cost. DLCA(ch) based biorefinery exhibited higher ethanol yield and lower pretreatment costs. When the biorefinery scale was 2000 Mg rice straw per day, the total capital investment and minimum ethanol selling price of DLCA(ch) based biorefinery were 17.9% and 30.0% lower, respectively, compared to dilute acid pretreatment based biorefinery.

A perusal of literature shows that the research in the field of RLSC of demolition waste (DW) is in an evolving phase. The improper information sharing (IS) is a serious issue in RLSC of DW, which has not been reviewed extensively. Thus, the aim of this study is to discern the aspects of IS in RLSC of DW and to provide potential future research directions on the topic. To accomplish the aim, the objectives of this paper are two folds: (i) to explore the aspects of IS in RLSC of DW; and (ii) to identify the future research directions of IS in RLSC of DW. A total of 89 articles from five search engines published between 2000 and 2019 were subjected to descriptive and content analysis. The descriptive analysis revealed that most of the reviewed studies were case studies and originated from developed countries. The content analysis found that complex, fragmented, cross-functional and multi-disciplinary nature of the supply chain primarily leads to improper IS in RLSC of DW. A collaborative network is needed to improve IS, which is facilitated by government and Information, Communications and Technology (ICT) based initiatives. The study makes a significant contribution by building the foundation on IS in RLSC of DW through proposing a conceptual framework. The conceptual framework shows an outline for the organisations in RLSC of DW to formulate their information initiative strategy. This could be considered as the first step to improve IS in RLSC of DW. Besides, the study also acknowledges several paths of doing further research to contribute to the domain under study.}

The obscuration rate, HRR (heat release rate) and Talarm (time of fire alarm) are obtained through FDS (Fire Dynamics Simulator) simulation study, and some valuable results are yield. The result shows that the lower level of hollowing rate, the greater variation of the obscuration rate value along with distance. Furthermore, the relationship between Talarm and hollowing rate was fitted by the functional relationship Y=a/(a+bx+cx2). Except for smoke detector above the fire source R = 0.69, the fitting results of other positions are better, and R values are all above 0.97.

This problem has been faced by means of a risk analysis. A simulator has been calibrated and validated with the support of expert operators in the field of air cargo logistics. Probabilistic Risk Assessment allowed us to solve the forecasting problem connected to human activities with hazardous characteristics. We applied the proposed method to a real case of study and it allowed us quantifying an average monetary loss for the current scenario (without any RFID implementation) close to the one currently experienced by the air cargo handling company. In the case of different RFID implementation set-ups (intermediate and full), the assessed values are coherent with the company’s operator expectations. In particular, we observed a big improvement for the intermediate RFID implementation set-up, whereas a full RFID set-up seems not worth to be implemented in accordance with the company’s managers’ anticipations.}

This paper addresses a multi-modal distribution network design problem with the aim of balancing the trade-off between economic and environmental benefits. The distribution network that we consider includes both transportation with trucks and ships. We propose a new mixed integer programming (MIP) model which decides the optimal design of the system, i.e. how many ships of each type to use, their corresponding routes and sailing speeds. It also suggests an optimal cargo flow through the maritime and road-based network. We show how the MIP model can be used to provide decision support through a case study from the distribution of automobiles in India, which has a vast coastline that can be used for maritime transportation. Environmental emissions from automobile transportation in India have been rapidly increasing in recent years with the fast economic development, and it has become a major contributor to regional air pollution and road congestion. One possible way to ease these negative environmental consequences is to consider a modal shift where some of the automobile transportation from the production facilities located close to the coastline is replaced by roll-on roll-off (RoRo) ships. Our study shows that multi-modal distribution is both environmentally friendly and economically beneficial, especially if more industrial players can collaborate to create economies of scale.}

This situation can result in higher transportation cost, more pollution as well as low asset utilization. Collaborative logistics can be a potential strategy to cope with this situation. A simulation model is developed and the potential influencing factors the performance of HLC are studied. The results show that higher information sharing frequency can improve the performance by reducing the travel distance and improving service level and truck utilization. Moreover, the comparison of the performance with and without collaboration shows that that the growers with higher order frequency would potentially benefit more from an HLC setting © 2019 IFAC.}

In this method, the damage level and remaining service life are firstly incorporated into the evaluation criteria of reuse modes, then a hybrid method (AHP-EW) that integrates Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Entropy Weight (EW) method is applied to derive criteria weights and the grey Multi-Attributive Border Approximation Area Comparison (MABAC) is adopted to rank the collection modes.

Here, the life cycle assessment method was used to calculate the carbon emissions at each step of the fruit and vegetable cold chain. Based on the energy balance equation, the refrigerated transportation methods and carbon emissions under different transportation times was studied. The results show that the carbon emission of 1 kg of fruits and vegetables in the cold logistics is 0.098 kg: In this carbon emission, the transportation step accounts for 82%, while the emission of the pre-cooling step, storage (sales) step and consumption (abandonment) step account for 7%, 6% and 5%, respectively. If the transportation time is within 5 h, the pre-cooled fruits and vegetables are best to be transported by insulated transportation. If the transportation time is between 5 and 60 h, the preferable transportation method is the cold storage transportation. Moreover, 70 kg of cold storage agent is needed per cubic meter when the latent heat of the cold storage agent is 270 kJ/kg. Comparing the cold storage transportation with the mechanical refrigerated transportation, the transportation time is less than 87 h (1.5tons) and 98 h (10tons), that is the cold storage transportation has lower carbon emission. We also found that the driving carbon emission of a 1.5tons small refrigerated truck is three times that of a 10tons heavy refrigerated truck. In order to reduce the carbon emission in the transportation step, a smaller shape factor H, a cold storage agent with a large phase change latent heat and a thicker insulation layer have been suggested.}

Particularly, in case of dairy industry, organizations are facing some important challenges containing people management, short shelf life, high food losses and wastage, high greenhouse gas emissions. Based on “Confederation of Indian industry - Dairy Vision 2025”, it is believed that the dairy sector in India has high potential if organizations can develop an effective logistics and supply chain system. This article attempts to analyze the interaction between distribution related challenges with a focus operational excellence and higher corporate green growth and sustainability viewpoints in food supply chains by considering the business example of four Indian dairy product based organizations using graph theory and matrix approach. Several key challenges were identified based on a literature survey and experts’ views. Graph theory and matrix approach has been applied to select the most significant challenge. The results show that food organizations must work on cold chain to manage logistics and distribution challenges to reduce wastage, decrease financial losses and to take environmental issues into account. This paper ranks the challenges as well as develop an index for the dairy industry to achieve corporate sustainability in its supply chain and logistics network. The present study findings will provide useful knowledge for managers and policy makers managing interaction between people and process aspects and corporate sustainability management in the agro-based diary organizational logistics and supply chains. This is one of the unique studies in food supply chain that helps in improving the logistics and supply performance in diary industries of emerging economies.}

abstract = {Pen and paper-based value stream mapping (VSM) is the established tool for recording processes, identifying waste and deriving recommendations for action. However, today, its application in manufacturing industry requires a high level of effort and is challenging due to product and process complexity, as well as dynamics. To overcome these shortcomings, we are developing a methodology to apply process mining (PM) to internal logistics for a mixed-model assembly line. The methodology combines multidimensional process mining (MDPM) techniques with proven principles of lean production and VSM. Firstly, internal logistics is modelled using existing event data by automatically mapping physical logistics activities (e.g. transport, store). Secondly, to enable PM, the event data is transformed into enriched event logs. Thirdly, the MDPM approach contains (1) a discovery analysis, (2) a performance analysis and (3) a conformance analysis including a reference process classification for each individual part and process. Finally, a waste analysis and strategy for practitioners is designed to identify and prioritise wasteful parts and processes. The methodology has been applied and evaluated in a case study at a German automotive manufacturer. In the case study, we analysed 7500 parts and 15 reference processes. An analysis for each individual part and process has not been available yet. We could both identify part-specific root causes (e.g. a long lead time) and process-specific root causes (e.g. a low trace fitness). The main contribution of this paper is to provide an MDPM methodology for practitioners to enable a continuous recording, evaluation and waste analysis of each individual part and process within internal logistics.}

abstract = {Road network restoration in affected areas is critical for search and rescue, evacuation, and relief distribution after a natural disaster. However, the accomplishment of post–disaster road network repair (PDRNR) performed by repair crews depends on an effective and efficient logistics support scheduling (LSS). However, existing studies on PDRNR have not taken into account the repair crew routing problem, which will affect the status of the road network interactively. To fill the gap, we focus on integrating LSS with the repair crew scheduling and routing problem (RCSRP) for PDRNR. A novel non–linear programming model is developed and an intertwined two–stage heuristic algorithm (ITSHA) is proposed for the LSS–RCSRP. In the first stage, an improved bacterial colony chemotaxis optimization algorithm (IBCCOA) is employed to determine the repair crew scheduling. In the second stage, LSS for each block and repair crew routing are determined in line with the repair crew scheduling and road network status. We validate and test the effectiveness of IBCCOA by solving some classical vehicle routing problems of different scales. To illustrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed model and ITSHA, we conduct a case study abstracted from the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake. The results show that by considering LSS, repair delays can be reduced by 45.71%, while the average restoration ratio can reach as high as 99.40% during the “golden 72 hours.”}

The network includes several types of facilities, such as city distribution centers, intermediary depots, parcel offices, as well as collect channel points, such as automated parcel stations (APS), stores or kiosks. The model formulation takes into account the influence of these collection points on consumer choice and the maximum distance customers are willing to walk to reach them. Realistic transportation costs are also considered, including detailed long haul costs and delivery costs in an area. The transportation costs inside an area are estimated via the Continuous Approximation proposed by Newell (1971) and Newell (1973), which results in a simpler problem than a location-routing problem, however, at the cost of losing linearity. For a special case of the problem, we propose a heuristic that, in our experimental setting, is on average 42.5 faster than the overall MIP and gives solutions within 1.02% of the optimum. Finally, we use the model to discuss the network design of a Spanish parcel carrier operating in Madrid.}

For optimal utilisation of human resources, it is necessary to balance the activities of caregivers and other professionals who perform services in a network and evaluate their services in combination with the strategic development of networks. The number of users is increasing. Since the optimal solution for servicing is changing, the system should dynamically adapt to the new requirements of building capacities, infrastructure and human resources. The purpose of this paper is to develop an innovative model to support these needs with a minimum number of caregivers who would balance their activities within the time window of their working day and combining investments and organisational decisions to achieve the above objectives at the minimal net present value of expenses. The number of caregivers and scheduling is decided by using a nonlinear assembly balancing algorithm in the manner of assembly-line balancing. This algorithm is combined with the multiple Travelling Salesman Problem and network investments planning, which provides a new tool written in the R programming language for decision making by evaluating the net present value of services and combining it with the investment costs to maintain a sustainable social system that provides adequate services. The case of planning in the East Slovenian region is presented.}

abstract = {The full adoption of electric autonomous vehicles (EAVs) will revolutionise the global transport system in general and road freight transport in particular. Traditional business models based on manufacturers selling trucks to operators could conceivably disappear. As with passenger transport, the rapid obsolescence of the technology and the cost will drive a non-ownership model and an evolution from products to services. Therefore it is expected that a new network operator will emerge to run this service, which in the future will likely develop into a fully smart network. As the value of the truck technology is reduced and the software component becomes the core source of value creation, it opens up the possibility of new entrants to the market who do not need to purchase physical assets at all and may instead rent them from a competitive pool of asset providers. Despite the recent growth in research on Mobility as a Service (MaaS) in passenger transport, these issues have been neglected in freight transport. The goal of this paper is to establish the features of this new smart network and derive a range of potential business models incorporating the changing roles of each actor, which are then evaluated against an analytical framework of business model innovation. The research concludes by proposing an update to the well-known OECD transportation model to include the network operator concept.}

However, the absence of voluntary take-back for relocation to needy markets limits the benefits of reverse logistics for sustainability practices in India. Production planning and RL design without taking product category and feedback into consideration are ineffective. Resulting in a pressing need to devise policies by incorporating economic costs, environmental costs, and effective product returns in the model aimed at sustainability through RL. This article demonstrates how the principles of Taguchi's Orthogonal Arrays can be applied in a system dynamics model highlighting the presence of two brand categories (preferred & un-preferred) and their respective RL processes that substantially influences product shelf life, maximum allowable sales loss, and delays in the reverse logistics process. The contributions of this research are: (i) market flooding of expired stock can be alleviated for longer shelf life and preferred brands by increasing marketing efforts. (ii) Increasing safety stocks helps sales in a dynamic market but does not alleviate market flooding. (iii) Due to the absence of feedback between reverse and forward logistics processes, improvements in reverse logistics attributes like product return and claims processing delays do not impact sales rather it alleviates market flooding. The medicine take-back policies in India need to be sensitive to the category of the product. There is also a potential for placing checks on the supply side to alleviate market flooding, and a need to provide feedback between reverse and forward logistics through risk-sharing agreements in order to enable product take-back for both disposal and relocation to needy markets. The possible research extensions include the structural changes in the proposed model to test RL, for sustainability policies and the study of brand/product level competition.}

This study proposes a conceptual model of a building information model that could effectively address the information needs during demolition, testing, grading and reprocessing of salvaged materials. The study uses semi-structured interviews and action research to identify information needs and Building Information Modelling (BIM) functionalities to develop the conceptual model using an Application Programming Interface (API) plug-in. The model when fully developed can extract the volumes of salvage, sorting, testing, reprocessing and integrate that information for optimised resources recovery. The extracted information in a single platform can help demolition planners and recyclers to design downstream operations, particularly testing and grading of salvaged products enabling an information flow-centric reverse logistics supply chain.}

abstract = {In a circular economy for remanufacturing, after each life cycle used products are returned to a remanufacturer for identification, inspection, sorting and reprocessing. Shortcomings and requirements of the remanufacturing market are identified through expert interviews and process analysis. A concept is proposed to enable an improved identification and a more objective inspection by enhancing the working environment and processes of sorting stations. Digitization and machine learning are applied on business data, using machine vision as well as sensor and actor skills of the worker. With an experimental case study on visual object recognition a positive impact on identification and thus sorting could be demonstrated.}

Green supply chain (GSC) in reverse logistics aims to minimize byproducts from ending up in landfills. This paper considers a retailer responsible for recycling and a manufacturer responsible for remanufacturing. Customer environmental awareness (CEA) is operationalized as customer word-of-mouth effect. We form three game theoretic models for two different scenarios with different pricing strategies, i.e. a non-cooperative pricing scenario based on Stackelberg equilibrium and Nash equilibrium, and a joint pricing scenario within a cooperative game model. The paper suggests that stakeholders are better off making their pricing and manufacturing decision in cooperation.}

The modular structure of the platform allows users to add their own nodes or extend the functionality of the existing ones. Nodes are communicating with the use of IoT technology, which serves as a bridge between the virtual and real worlds, making this platform truly digital. Blockchain technology is not only used for writing down agreements and for making transactions, but also as a trustworthy public listing of services and information. It connects the nodes into a public and secure system that provides reliable services of a supply chain. In this work, we describe the individual nodes and their implementation and present preliminary results of experiments using a laboratory model of a logistic chain.}

Economic and cost based partner relationships are no longer acceptable for 3PRLPs or for organizations that seek to introduce sustainable supply chain management. Recent emphasis on sustainability has made 3PRLP evaluation and selection more complex. In order to advance this area of research and to help further incorporate sustainability into 3PRLPs selection modeling, a novel multi-stage, multi-method, multi-criteria approach is developed. Methodologically, this is the first time that neighborhood rough set (NRS) theory is integrated with TOPSIS and VIKOR techniques. Neighborhood rough set, as a data management and soft computation tool, can help reduce the number of 3PRLP to be evaluated and ranked using TOPSIS combined with VIKOR's compromise conception decision tools. A conceptual application is developed using business, environmental, and social factors within the context of reverse logistics management decisions. A sensitivity analysis evaluating various neighborhood rough set parameters is also introduced to investigate robustness of solutions using the multi-stage methodology. Methodological implications and future research and application directions conclude the paper.}

The purpose of this study is to propose a hybrid simulation framework, which can help to forecast events that can interrupt the operational process and have negative impacts on the logistic delivery system. Therefore, a number of research studies have addressed the logistic performance evaluations of fleet management issues in the supply chain. However, most existing research lack inbuilt of hybrid simulation models in logistic management that take into consideration of dynamic feedback and interactions effects, that would allow assessing and addressing the reliability of the logistic delivery system. For this reason, the hybrid simulation paradigm is implemented for modelling the complex logistics management system. This study suggests a novel hybrid-modelling framework with the combination of agent-based modelling and system dynamics to address the dynamic risk effects in the logistic delivery. The main contribution of this study is to suggest a new framework for decision making in delivery management to compare the outcomes of different logistics risk process. This research enables managers and scholars to combine two methods of simulation to reconfigure a framework in new combinations to produce a solution that is useful for logistic operations. The proposed framework offers decision-makers an alternative way of logistics management.}

Such marketplace introduction strategy leads ﬁckle consumers to have more options. Both the logistics costs of products and product information of channels primarily affect consumers’ behavior and retailers’ profits. From the perspective of retailers, the strategy is not clear. Motivated by the observation, we develop a retailer-Stackelberg game model to investigate the introduction of the marketplace in the interaction of logistics cost-value (LCV) ratio and product information. Our analytical results indicate that eﬀectively deliver of product information has a positive effect on retail prices. Moreover, after the marketplace channel enter, the changes in consumer demand varies by product categories with differing LCV ratio. Note that, we show that the introduction is more beneficial for retailers whose product information is more available. Under this situation, the suppliers who have a low (respectively, high) information delivery efficiency and sell the product with big (respectively, small) LCV ratio is not welcome by retailers. In addition, when the marketplace product information is more available, retailers are more likely to open the platform for the big LCV ratio product. Our findings not only provide the suggestions for reselling-first online retailers who want to introduce and manage marketplace channel but also contribute to the literature of marketplace and online multichannel supply chain.}

Using data from the logistics service industry, it is shown that when the level of hierarchy is comparatively low, where buyers and suppliers interact participatively, both relational and formal innovation alignment are effective in fostering supplier-initiated innovation. Yet, as the relationship becomes more hierarchical and dominated by the buyer, the effect of relational innovation alignment diminishes and eventually turns negative, while the effect of formal innovation alignment is strengthened.}

Owing to battery capacity limitations, electric vehicles may need recharging during delivery process. Hence, the traditional vehicle routing methodologies, which were designed for fossil fuel-powered vehicles, are not feasible for electric vehicles. For this reason, this paper studies the urban logistics distribution routing problem of electric vehicles in the context of sharing economy with the consideration of carbon taxes (taxes on CO2 emissions) and time-of-use electricity prices (time-varying electricity prices), and proposes an optimization model of the electric vehicle routing problem in view of sharing economy. The proposed optimization model aims to minimize the total cost, which includes the operation, penalty, queuing (waiting at the charging stations), electricity and environment costs. An ant colony algorithm is developed for optimization purposes in the model. In this study, simulations are conducted based on a case study with actual locations. The first simulated scenario indicates that adopting distribution sharing is able to reduce travelling distances as well as the total cost in comparison to having separate distribution systems. The second simulated scenario is conducted under different time electricity prices; the results show that lower time-of-use electricity prices alleviate traffic congestion and reduce the total cost. In the third simulated scenario, the effects of different carbon taxes are analysed. The results show that the CO2 emissions will decrease when the carbon tax rate is increased. Finally, the limitations and future research directions of this paper are also discussed.}

Considering on-street satellite phenomena in city logistics practices and the concept of road space sharing between delivery operations and city traffic, we introduce the two-echelon city logistics system with on-street satellites (2E-CLS-OS). The 2E-CLS-OS uses time windows and satellite transshipment constraints to make routes of each of the two echelons interacting. At various time windows of on-street satellites, the real-time transshipment capacity needed by the transshipment operation is constrained by the permitted maximal transshipment capacity and the occupied transshipment capacity. The mathematical formulation for the 2E-CLS-OS is developed. The variable neighborhood search (VNS) heuristic is provided, based on the initial solution constructed by the savings-based heuristic (CW). The model formulation and the VNS are tested by using 20 randomly-generated small-scale instances. The VNS is used to solve 33 realistic instances with up to 30 on-street satellites and 900 customers.

This paper seeks to minimize a summation of energy cost and power sources cost, while satisfying vehicle power demand and battery health requirements. Considering different drive cycles, the optimal parameters and energy cost are systematically investigated. As a result, the optimal battery rated power and energy capacity are about 54 kW and 29 kWh, respectively, which are not affected by different drive cycles, given an electric-only range between 40 km and 60 km. Finally, based on the developed convex programming control law and optimal parameters, we examine the power distribution of the plug-in fuel cell urban logistics vehicle with different hydrogen prices, which significantly influences the vehicle's fuel economy.}

Therefore, this paper proposes a quantitatively analysis approach for operational risks in ECL based on extensive historical e-commerce transaction data. More specifically, the typical operation process of ECL is extracted through sequential analysis of key activities. After that, taking operation time as the key performance indicator, the performance patterns of different operation phases are analyzed. Then, considering the diverse distributions of operation time in different phases, especially the multimodal distribution of transportation time, a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based risk analysis approach is proposed.

The implementation of RGLP requires the joint efforts of governments, logistics enterprises and consumers. To identify the optimal strategy for RGLP, this paper studies the behavioural choice of governments, logistics enterprises and consumers. First, a three-party evolutionary game model is constructed among governments, logistics enterprises and consumers. Second, evolutionary stable strategies (ESS) are discussed. Finally, a numerical simulation of the model is conducted to analyze the impact of some key parameters on the behaviour of governments, logistics enterprises and consumers. The results show that when government subsidies increase, logistics enterprises will develop and implement RGLP faster. When the rewards of logistics enterprises’ increase, consumers will respond to corporate rewards to different degrees according to the level of environmental awareness. When environmental awareness is low, enterprise rewards will make consumers choose to use RGLP significantly faster. When the cycle times of RGLP increase, the effect on logistics enterprises will be reduced because of the upper limit of the parameters. The results provide a theoretical basis for the implementation of RGLP, which is helpful for governments and logistics enterprises to make more scientific and reasonable decisions.}

abstract = {The logistics performance of a country is crucial to national and international trade, and therefore has a direct effect on economic development. Owing to limited resources, policymakers need a guide for specifying the factors that need to be focused upon to bring about immediate and significant improvements in the logistics performance of their countries. This study aims to propose a methodology to develop a roadmap for policymakers in improving the logistics performance of their countries. For this purpose, we analyze the effect of the competitiveness pillars of the Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) on logistics performance (as measured by the Logistics Performance Index (LPI)), using a three-stage integrative methodology based on a tree-augmented naive Bayesian network, partial least square path model, and importance-performance map analysis. An empirical study is conducted using the GCI pillars of the World Economic Forum and the LPI of the World Bank. The results indicate that governments should focus on technological readiness, higher education and training, innovation, market size, and infrastructure to facilitate improvement in the logistics performance of their countries.}

Sustainable development of urban logistics is becoming more and more important for the quality of dwellers life, while the solution of two main problems - congestion and poor air quality is the key to success in this field. The use of cargo bikes as a means of transport operating at least part of freight flows within the city has a positive impact on both problems. The article presents the course and results of field research on the use of cargo bikes in urban logistics in Stargard under the Low Carbon Logistic project. Particular attention was paid to the condition of the existing bicycle and road infrastructure in Stargard and the possibility of using cargo bikes for the needs of local government administration. The applied bicycles were also analyzed in terms of adapting their mobility and transport capabilities to the needs of potential users.}

In the Industry 4.0 context, several terms are used to express the model, such as readiness assessment model, roadmap, framework, and maturity index. They have the same purpose of measuring how the current state of an organization unit is capable of adopting and implementing the concept of industry 4.0 in the future. Many researchers had proposed maturity models for assessing Industry 4.0 readiness and maturity since 2011 when Industry 4.0 was commenced. However, there has been no attempt to analyze empirical evidence systematically. This paper aims to analyze currently available maturity models related to Industry 4.0 and provide a synthesis on those maturity models. This paper describes a systematic literature review (SLR) of empirical studies implemented on the maturity model published in several reputable and relevant sources. It focuses on the manufacturing and logistics sectors since the processes in both sectors can be highly improved through the introduction of technologies such as cyber-physical systems, internet of things, and artificial intelligence. In general, the primary purpose of the review is to address the following questions: (1) Based on what dimensions do researchers develop Industry 4.0 maturity models, and what are the most used and influencing parameters in those dimensions? (2) How do those maturity models compare to each other in terms of dimension complexity, techniques, maturity leveling, and kind of application sectors of the model? In conclusion, the maturity model in the context of Industry 4.0 is promising to guide the adoption of industry 4.0 technologies at the organization level. However, just having a maturity model is not enough. More efforts are needed to facilitate the application of it.}

The New National Standard for e-bicycles is to be introduced in China, that might result in the country becoming the largest source of battery waste in the world. If the waste batteries are not recycled appropriately, it will cause significant heavy metal pollution, which will in turn, pose a serious threat to the ecological environment and human health. This paper discusses the current status of recycling of e-bicycle batteries in China and reviews the current recycling approaches. We developed a waste e-bicycle battery recycling system based on “Internet+” to solve the dilemma of recycling end-of-life batteries; this system has three subsystems: offline reverse logistics recovery system, online network recycling system, and traceability management system. In particular, the participation of consumers and government, reward-penalty mechanism, “Internet +” development, and other strategies are considered to improve recycling systems throughout life cycle of the products. The proposed recycling system can increase the waste battery recycling rate by 2.59% under the reward-penalty mechanism, and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 58%, which is conducive to promoting sustainable development.}

Firstly, a total of 222 effective questionnaires are collected in two provinces, with answers from dispatchers on electric tricycles’ usage, satisfaction, preference and policies. Secondly, binary logit model is used to analyze behavioral preferences. The results show that: 1) the driving speed is greatly influenced by battery life, daily mileage and the maximum width of tricycles; 2) the load capacity is mainly related to cargo volume, and its benefits on speeding up delivery process as well as cutting down the cost; 3) the single-charge mileage is mostly affected by limitation on the least delivering parcels, and the maximum height of tricycles; 4) other satisfaction indicators include gender, driving qualification, affordability and intelligent degree of electric tricycles. In China, it’s primary to consider factors such as gender, average delivered volume, sufficient loading capacity, the maximum carriage height and burglar alarming system, in order to vigorously develop the logistics and distribution of electric tricycle. Lastly, corresponding policies are proposed based on the results of the model. The research results of this paper can provide reference for the electric tricycle enterprises to manufacture tricycles, and also provide support for the formulation of new electric tricycle policies.}

However, given the uncertainties in demand quantity and timing, reserves (i.e., medicines, drugs, compressed food) can expire if they are not used in a timely manner, resulting in a huge wastage or the expired reserves being consumed. Considering factors of uncertain demand, resource wastage and cost efficiency together, this paper focuses on procurement and reserves cooperation between a given government authority and a strategic supplier in a framework of quantity commitment contract. Under some plausible assumptions, the optimal recycling and replenishment policies, and the government’s optimal payment strategies are formulated. Through a numerical example and sensitivity analyses, the practical applicability of the proposed model to the procurement and reserves management for humanitarian logistics, underlining managerial insights, is examined. Specially, this paper suggests that the government should actively cooperate with suppliers to co-reserve perishable or consumable materials, and give priority to suppliers whose operational costs are low and market shares are big. Moreover, factors, including materials’ shelf-life, customers’ perception and consumption rate, etc., should be carefully evaluated when the government selects perishable materials as reserves and corresponding suppliers as partners.}

In the first echelon, trucks depart from a single depot and transport goods to two types of locations. At covering locations, such as parcel lockers, customers can pick up goods themselves. At satellite locations, goods are transferred to zero-emission vehicles (such as cargo bikes) that deliver to customers. If desired, customers can indicate their choice for delivery. The 2E-VRP-CO aims at finding cost-minimizing solutions by selecting locations and routes to serve all customers. We present a compact mixed integer programming formulation and an efficient and tailored adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic that provides high-quality, and often optimal, solutions to the 2E-VRP-CO. The 2E-VRP-CO has as special cases the two-echelon vehicle routing problem, and the simultaneous facility location and vehicle routing problem without duration constraints. On these special cases, for which our heuristic predominantly solves the established benchmark instances either to optimality or to the best-known solution, our heuristic finds three new best-known solutions. Moreover, we introduce a new set of benchmark instances for the 2E-VRP-CO and provide managerial insights when distribution via both satellite and covering locations is most beneficial. Our results indicate that customers in the same area are best-served either via cargo-bikes or parcel lockers (i.e., not both), and that the use of parcel lockers has a great potential to reduce driving distance.}

We adopt this hybrid approach to take the advantages offered by both methods, and designate the former for weighting the considered criteria, and the latter for ranking the alternatives. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed hybrid approach, we apply it to a case study on the selection of third-party reverse logistics providers (3PRLPs) for a car parts manufacturing company and benchmark it with the MOORA method. The outcome of this study indicates that our proposed approach can offer more viable performance when facing qualitative data and input uncertainties, and consequently, lends itself to a wider range of applications.}

abstract = {The current aim of NASA's Journey to Mars is a stepwise approach towards landing humans on the Red Planet, culminating in a sustained presence. There are many recent studies on how this could be achieved in an evolvable and affordable manner. Most architectures begin with crewed missions to Phobos or Mars orbit in the mid-2030's, progress toward short-stay missions on the surface, and then culminate with regular, long-stay missions at a permanent outpost in the 2040's. A common factor of these architectures is that many robotic launches would be required in order to support the crew by prepositioning mission elements and other needed supplies. In this paper, the use of 150 kW reusable Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) tugs as a means to deliver elements both to orbit and the surface is studied. The conceptual SEP tugs make use of continued technology developments that were initialized through the Asteroid Redirect Robotic Mission (ARRM). They would also be used to deliver food and supplies to sustain the crews similar to resupply missions for the International Space Station. These SEP tugs would cycle (with loitering) between staging orbits in cislunar space and Mars orbit. The concepts presented here focus on the use of SEP for purposes of delivering cargo, and could potentially be complimentary to many human Mars architectures presented in the literature. In order to characterize mission design parameters such as dates, masses, and durations, thousands of optimized trajectories were run using low-thrust optimization software. Solutions are found for all launch/arrival date pairs for the years 2038–2053. They can be displayed as contour plots called Bacon plots – the SEP equivalent of porkchop plots. Possible mission architecture concepts for a steady-state human presence on Mars along with the cargo missions needed to keep it functioning are described and the relevant mission parameters such as launch dates, masses, arrival dates, etc., are given. It was found that the reusable SEP tug architecture would be highly beneficial to the logistics of a sustainable Mars outpost.}

This paper studies the cold chain logistics of front warehouses, and a time-depend green vehicle routing problem (TDGVRP) is proposed from the perspective of low-carbon economy. By pouring attention into the fixed cost, refrigeration cost, fuel consumption cost, carbon emission cost, the cost of violating the time window and damage cost, a cold chain logistics routing plan is determined for the vehicle from the distribution center to front warehouses. In the meantime, a new idea of calculating refrigeration cost is proposed. Besides, this paper also explores the effect of traffic congestion and carbon tax of the TDGVRP. A traffic congestion index is used to describe the degree of traffic congestion. Moreover, a hybrid simulated annealing and tempering algorithm (HSATA) is proposed to address this model. The computational results demonstrate that the deteriorating traffic condition would increase carbon emission, while the increased carbon tax would reduce carbon emission within a certain range. The proposed HSATA method enormously reduces the cost of enterprises, which supports the decision-making of cold chain logistics in green and sustainable development.}

We argue that top management plays an essential role in mediating transaction attributes to exercise their influences on logistics outsourcing success. However, such a mediating mechanism is effective only when trustworthy alternative 3 PL providers are available in the market. The data from 250 manufacturing subsidiaries in China are used to test our model. Important implications for research and practices are discussed.}

The primary objective of the optimization model is to maximize the expected profit generated by selling recycled materials to the secondary markets and to make the landfilling option less attractive. In comparison with the state-of-the-art stochastic optimization models in this area, which mainly focus on the expected optimal value, this paper emphasizes the role of source separation of recyclable materials to increase the productivity level at the collection centers (CC). Indeed, the quantity of materials collected from the supply sources and the recycling rates at the CC are the primary sources of uncertainty considered in this study. A Sample Average Approximation (SAA) procedure is developed to solve the stochastic model and perform sensitivity analyses on the number of supply sources, the sample size and the level of uncertainty targeting the random parameters. Managerial implications are discussed through a case study from the demolition industry in the province of Quebec, Canada. Although the use of source separation centers (SSC) improves the network performance in both rural and urban zones, the additional flexibility provided by these platforms reaches its best efficiency in the case of high-density urban areas. Finally, the results suggest significant RLND adjustments that lead to an increase in the average profit by 17.6% and recycle around 29% of additional building materials waste from demolition.}

An automation policy is utilized within a smart production system under a forward and a backward logistics system. Such logistic network generally consists of a well-structured transportation system, which may increase the carbon footprint. This study deals how the carbon footprint can be controlled by a smart production system and it obtains the net present value of products for the four sub-systems associated with the logistics system. To investigate this, four sub-systems as manufacturing, distribution, consumption, and remanufacturing are implemented. A solution methodology is designed with an integral transformation through the frequency domain. This smart logistics system can be used by an associated matrix through an input-output analysis based on the distribution center. An illustrative numerical experiment is conducted and the study reveals that the discounted sale in disposal subsection at the end of the logistic cycle gives high positive impact, where the efficiency is increased due to discarding defective products by the automation policy. Graphical studies on the effect of transportation time for the total net present value and the net present value for disposal items are compared. It is found that two-stage inspection process reveals less amount of defective items and less pollution. As the closed-loop supply chain management is considered and due to transportation, huge amount of carbon emissions are passing through the environment, this study gives the reduced amount of carbon and more perfect products by an optimum cash-flow within a smart production system under advanced logistics management.}

The International Maritime Organization predicts that the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from transportation will be increasing significantly until 2050, driven by the growth in global maritime trade. Managing logistics distribution routes is considered a possible approach for controlling GHG emissions. This study aims to implement a green logistics concept in the logistics distribution of petroleum products—gasoline, kerosene, and diesel—in eastern Indonesia, whose supply sources are refineries located in Balikpapan and Kasim. A multi-objective approach is used to implement the green logistics concept. Multi-objective optimization is conducted using the AIMMS software to optimize a logistics system consisting of a multi-depot, multi-product, and heterogeneous fleet. The optimization is performed to determine the best logistics route and the amount of products delivered using certain types of fleets to minimize transportation cost and GHG emissions using constant speed. In addition, this study also investigates the effect of variable speed on cost and CO2 emissions. For the constant speed case, the distribution routes obtained for the minimizing cost scenario tends to maximize the utilization of transit terminals while in the minimizing emissions scenario tends to deliver directly to the distribution centers, so the route decision in multi-objective optimization scenario is combination of the two. The multi-objective optimization results an 11% cost reduction and a 17% GHG emission reduction compared with the current values. The comparison between constant and variable speed reveals that the variable speed is preferred to constant speed as it gives lower emissions with slight changes in cost.}

Based on the service-dominant logic, this study identifies a number of operant resources and investigates various configurations of operant resources amongst these three players in the maritime logistics service triad. The results provide guidance for policymakers as well as firm-level decision-makers who must take an integrative approach to capture the multi-actor nature of the phenomenon. The findings may help managers understand how operationalization of their policies and decisions may affect both the type of operant resources used for value creation as well as their interdependence.

One of these approaches is sustainable supply chains, which have been implemented in different aspects of supply chains. Most third-party logistics (3 PLs) companies now provide their services utilizing the sustainable supply chain approach. In this study, we consider a 3PL in a supply chain with two goals: decreasing carbon emission and delivery time using a game theoretic approach, which is considered for the first time. We suppose that consumers are aware about the green transportation. Also, it is assumed that two manufacturers deliver their products to the same retailer using a 3 PL. The manufacturers use the 3 PL mainly because it is a way to provide green transportation and increase customer satisfaction by ensuring that products are delivered in a timely fashion to the retailer. This paper examines product pricing, the greenness determination for the first manufacturer's product, and the variables for the 3 PL, including the amount of carbon dioxide emissions and delivery time. Three scenarios are considered in this research: a centralized game and two decentralized games. The results show that it is essential to establish competition between the supply chain members to obtain greater profitability and an acceptable level of sustainability indicators. In the decentralized Stackelberg game between the manufacturers, they earn the highest profit. In the centralized game, the product greenness is the lowest, and in the decentralized game when the 3 PL is the leader, the product greenness is the highest.}

abstract = {Reverse logistics is an important business process in the iron and steel industry for the collection, recycle, and reuse of scrapped metals. Focusing on the contradiction between the strong potential and the backward practice status of recycling scrapped steel, this paper establishes a decision framework in an attempt to help steel companies choose the best RL modes and effectively use the resource of scrapped steel. Recognizing that companies are facing intense market, political, and social pressures to improve their reverse logistic practices, we propose a comprehensive framework that encompasses six dimensions: economic, social, environmental, government policy, internal management practices, and external market competition. By working with major Chinese iron and steel companies, we first identify key decision factors along these dimensions. A multi-criteria decision-making method then is applied to analyze dependency and feedback among these decision factors and to suggest the most suitable reverse logistic strategy among the alternatives. The results indicate that governmental policy making has an outsized impact on incentivizing companies to invest in reverse logistic systems. We also find that external market and economic factors provide important feedback for shaping government policies.}

abstract = {Unique features of solar energy, such as the low cost of operation and low pollution, make photovoltaic power plants attractive. Despite the advantages of these power plants, such as low cost of operation and operating without pollution, their high establishment cost compared to that of the conventional fossil fuel-fired power plants prevents their rapid growth. Therefore, designing and optimizing an efficient supply chain network will help to develop the photovoltaic industry. This study proposes a bi-objective model to design and optimize a thin-film photovoltaic power plant supply chain network integrating reverse logistics. The first objective minimizes the costs of supply chain network design, which optimizes decisions from suppliers to disposal centers. The second objective maximizes the efficiency of the data envelopment analysis model to find suitable locations of facilities. As there is uncertainty in electricity demand prediction and perfect foresight is not possible, a fuzzy-robust programming approach is devised to cope with the uncertain parameters. The validity and practicality of the proposed approach are investigated by a case study based on real-world data. Finally, K-Means clustering is incorporated into the model to analyze the installed photovoltaic capacity of different cities in each period. The results show that using an optimistic approach to deal with uncertainty reduces the total cost by 20% in comparison with using a pessimistic approach. The results also provide helpful insights for decision-makers and policymakers in allocating and optimizing the operation of facilities by considering the real-world characteristics of the candidate locations.}

abstract = {The patient care processes in hospitals are supported by a range of operational activities including inventory management and distribution of supplies to point-of-care locations. Hospitals carry large amounts and a great variety of items, and the issues of storing and distributing these items throughout the hospital supply chain are of great importance to providing high-quality patient service. Healthcare logistics encompasses the process of handling physical goods (e.g. pharmaceuticals, surgical medical products, medical equipment, sterile items, linen, food, etc.) and the associated information flows, from the reception of the goods within a hospital to their delivery at patient care locations. The medical supply costs constitute the second largest expenditure in hospitals, after personnel costs. A high-performing supply chain may realize improved outcomes (e.g. safe and quality patient service) and greater efficiency. Logistics managers need to identify opportunities to improve the logistics processes in order to lower costs and to improve patient care quality. However, in order to improve the logistics processes, you must understand how the healthcare supply chain is currently performing. Measuring the performance of the supply chain is fundamental to identify and address deficiencies in the logistics activities, and it serves as a good input for managerial decision-making. The purpose of this article is to present existing research on performance measurement at the internal hospital supply chain (e.g. inventory management, distribution activities), and more specifically in the operating theatre since it is among the most critical resources for a hospital. At the operating theatre, the requested items should be available at the right time at the right place, in the right condition, at the lowest cost possible. Furthermore, we will also discuss literature on multi-criteria decision-making techniques. It enables researchers to build a performance measurement framework and to prioritize between multiple performance indicators since a diverse group of stakeholders with conflicting interests is involved in the internal operating room supply chain.}

The aim is to contribute to sustainability improvements (e.g., cost reduction and environmental and social benefits) within the system. The main drivers that support this approach are the existence of unutilized capacity in some digesters and the possibility of reducing the process sludge age to maintain its biogas potential during the aerobic treatment in the plants without AD facilities. Furthermore, the effect of co-digestion as a means of enhancing the amount of biogas that can be produced through the sludge is also considered. This innovative approach leads to a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model to optimize the sludge flows that connect the plants without AD facilities to the ones with anaerobic digesters. The developed approach was applied to a Portuguese water utility and the results provide new insights for an optimized sludge management process of WWTPs, also indicating that the economic benefit obtained from the proposed strategy for sludge management can lead to a reduction of up to 23.5% in terms of current energy costs.}

However, the existing full-automated solutions cannot meet the variety and variation of E-commerce warehousing demands. Inspired by cellular manufacturing, a flexible and reconfigurable warehousing system called cellular warehousing is put forward. Although several articles have illustrated this new concept, few systematic studies on cell formation, scenario design and physical emulation model exist. This study develops this conceptual model with three-fold objectives. First, the cell formation and operation flow of cellular warehousing are deciphered. Second, application scenarios are given including intra-cell and inter-cell operation, with the background of different types of order processing. At last, a physical emulation model is created as test-bed for further qualitative evaluation and insight abstraction.}

abstract = {Some sub-coalitions can not be formed or fail to satisfy the superadditivity in many realistic cooperative transferable utility (TU) games, which particularly exists in the logistics service industry. To exploit some novel solutions for addressing these TU games, we firstly propose again the equal surplus division value based on the least square method and players’ common excess vector, and then introduce the weighted equal surplus division value. Both of them belong to the family of the least square values. Inspired by the fact that many TU games base the profit distribution strategies not only on the egalitarian principle but also on the utility principle, the equal contribution division value and the weighted equal contribution division value based on the least square method and players’ contribution excess vector are spontaneously generated. An algorithm is described to make the four solutions proposed in this paper satisfy the property of individual rationality. Finally, to show the advantages, the practicability and the rationality of the four solutions, a practical example about the profit distribution strategy of a logistics enterprise coalition is illustrated and the contrastive analysis among them is given.}

abstract = {Effective solutions to the hazardous material location and routing problem are of practical significance, for both logistics companies and government departments. However, most existing hazardous material location and routing studies lack certain practicabilities in dealing with real-life problems. In this paper, we present a novel multi-objective optimization method for finding the optimal routes in hazardous material logistics under the constraint of traffic restrictions in inter-city roads. In addition, to move the solution method closer to practical application, we propose to consider multiple paths between every possible origin-destination pair. The resulting multi-objective location-routing model is able to jointly address the important aspects of risk, cost, and customer satisfaction in hazardous material logistics management. A single genetic algorithm and an adaptive weight genetic algorithm are proposed to solve the proposed model respectively, whose chromosomes contain two types of genes, representing warehouses and transportation routes respectively. A real-world case study is provided to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed model and its associated solution method.}

Among them, many service operations, which require customers to travel and visit a place indoor, become almost infeasible to run in a crowded city like Hong Kong. Motivated by a recent reported real case on an innovative service operation in Hong Kong, we build analytical models to explore how logistics and technologies together can transform the “static service operations” to become the “bring-service-near-your-home” mobile service operations. We also highlight how the government may provide the subsidy to support the above mentioned mobile service operation (MSO) to make it financially viable. We specifically show that the government may adopt the fixed-cost-subsidy (FCS) scheme, operations-cost-subsidy (OCS) scheme or safety-technology-support (STS) scheme to help. We further uncover that the OCS scheme would bring a larger consumer surplus than the FCS scheme and is hence more preferable. In the extended models, we first study the case when service fee cannot be changed because of corona virus outbreak (CVO). We then explore the feasibility of adopting MSO in the long run as a financially self-sustainable service operation and derive the analytical conditions under which MSO is a win-win business model for both the service provider and consumers. Finally, we study the optimal safety technology investment problem.}

To better describe the preference information and expert evaluation information, this paper utilizes 2-dimensional linguistic (2DL) information to express the preference information of various commodities and the expert evaluation, which can represent not only the evaluation information of experts but also the reliability of the evaluation information. Additionally, for solving the CLDCLS problem, this paper puts forward improved operational rules a score function, a distance formula and a correlation coefficient measure. Based on the 2DL information and the improved operational rules, we propose a 2-dimensional linguistic similarity-degree-based clustering analysis method, the 2-dimensional linguistic partitioned Maclaurin symmetric mean (2DLPMSM) operator, and the 2-dimensional linguistic weighted partitioned Maclaurin symmetric mean (2DLWPMSM) operator. The corresponding properties and special cases are demonstrated. By using these proposed methods, this paper constructs a MAGDM solution framework for the CLDCLS problem. A practical case of the CLDCLS problem is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness, rationality, robustness and superior performance of the proposed method.}

Empty containers are a necessary outcome of such trade and have operational costs close to that of full containers yet are not a source of revenue as the latter is. A literature review revealed regional repositioning to be a complex problem due to a multitude of interacting parts and distributed decision making among stakeholders which have conflicting objectives. The goal is to optimise the activities related to urban goods movements and reduce the total social cost of these activities. The purpose of this study is to develop a detailed description and understanding of the empty container movements in Melbourne using a modelling approach designed to represent complex systems. This paper explores the cause and effects of the land-side empty container repositioning. Then the key characteristics of the system were captured into a conceptual model that documents and articulates the logistics processes, interactions, power-relations, problems and potential solutions of the freight system. The conceptual model was translated into a simulation model in the form of an agent-based model. The agent-based model was a proof-of-concept which provided an opportunity to graphically imitate the logistics processes and interactions of the system in a natural, flexible and dynamic way. Empty containers represent a sizeable proportion of logistics activity, however previous studies on container freight operations in Melbourne have tended to focus on commercially valuable, loaded containers - not empty containers. This paper closes the gap in understanding of empty container management in Melbourne as represented in a concept model and agent-based model.}

The potential of global warming, acidification, photochemical oxidation, and human toxicity was determined for both scenarios. Moreover, fuel, infrastructure, and vehicle consumption concerning the changes among the settings were compared. All categories of environmental impact presented significant reductions regarding the changes among scenarios for the distribution of vegetables.
