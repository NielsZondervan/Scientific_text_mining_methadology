The requirements for flexibility in the fields of logistics and handling can be met by the abilities of mobile robotics. Currently, the presented use of mobile robots is rather confined, although these machines are highly flexible. The main objective of this research paper is the generation of a general schedule of robot skills based on a flow chart. This model serves to evaluate parameters of environment and product characteristics together with robot abilities, the whole being subsequently analysed by a specific algorithm.}

Companies have to enhance their capability on GSCM activities based on not only emerging environmental regulations but also enthusiastic politics of the companies about environmental practices. GSCM requires multi-dimensional approaches, thus multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) techniques should be implemented while evaluating GSCM performance of companies. Moreover, fuzzy group decision making methods should be implemented in order to seek solutions for vague and complex multi-attribute problems in fuzzy environment. In this study, a model based on integrated fuzzy MCDM methods is proposed for evaluating GSCM performance of companies in terms of green design, green purchasing, green transformation, green logistics and reverse logistics. The cause and effect interrelationship amongst GSCM dimensions is figured out using fuzzy DEMATEL method. Then, based on this interrelationship, fuzzy ANP method is implemented for calculating the weights of the related criteria. Finally, fuzzy TOPSIS method is applied by using the weights obtained from fuzzy ANP method, for evaluating and ranking the GSCM performance of alternative companies.}

The integration of modern Internet technologies enables distributed production using AM on a global scale and conditioning monitoring of machines and processes. The manufacturing of products distributed in locations closer to the final usage point may have several advantages, such as reduced logistics costs and reduced inventory levels over the supply chain. However, distributed manufacturing imposes many challenges on standards, quality control and information management across different manufacturing sites. The potential benefits and the difficulties are increased when considering the high value added spare parts market. To supply ad hoc demand in diverse locations, inventory and logistics costs are comparatively high. The advent of Industrie 4.0 coupled with the development of AM for final metal parts provides the technical base for a distributed AM solution for spare parts. The aim of this paper is to discuss the technical aspects involved in the conception and implementation of distributed manufacturing use cases based on AM. These use cases have been developed with design and engineering – providing the product model – in Germany, and the AM site – providing the manufacturing structure and machines – in Brazil, together forming a distributed development and manufacturing network. Four implemented use cases demonstrate the potential of the approach developed, varying the degree of information control of the central factory over the production.}

Analysis of the model shows that the impact of the seaport's and dry port's throughput, intermodal carriers’ profit, importers’ and exporters’ logistics costs on the hinterland chain choice can either be amplified or extenuated, depending on the existence of what we refer to as indirect effects.}

In this context, the project “Logistics for Energy Crops Biomass (LogistEC)” aims to develop new or improve technologies of biomass logistics chain. In this project, the sustainability of different types of biomass is analysed in terms of environmental, economic and social impacts, based on the supply chain of two existing plants. The objective of this paper is to present the main results obtained in the socio-economic analysis of the French case and its climate change consequences. The Input-Output Analysis (IOA) has been seen as the most appropriate method to estimate these impacts using a Multiregional Input-Output Table from the World Input-Output Database project. Socio-economic effects have been estimated in terms of additional economic activity, added value and job creation. By extending the IOA with environmental accounts, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have also been estimated. Additionally, the most stimulated sectors have been identified. Results highlight the importance of biomass at a national level.}

abstract = {Different modes of transport are frequently used to transfer goods from origin to destination, especially on medium-long distances, in relation to the network supply, the available services, the costs. The transfer from one carrier to another, in an interchange node such as a port, a rail station, a logistics terminal, often implicates an increase of monetary and temporal costs, connected to material and immaterial operations. The principal aim is to minimize the overall cost of transport, but the freight interchange node can represent critical steps in logistics chain and for this reason much attention is now committed to actions to make efficient the functional organization of the terminal. In the last years an increasing interest is directed to the use of vehicles technologically advanced with automation of functions. The paper focuses on a particular technology, conceived recently, otherwise an intelligent rail wagon called AGW (Automated Guided Wagon) for handling of containers in a port. The use of intelligent system AGW as handling unit of containers in the yard, would allow the overcoming of diseconomies of scale and the reduction of the handling times and costs through a flexible management in relation to the characteristics of the transport supply and demand, the latter subject to a high variability. In the paper, after a brief description of the AGW technology and the advantages connected to the use of this handling system in a freight interchange node, the attention is focused on a comparative analysis between the handling system now operating in the container port (RTG, Straddle Carrier, AVG, etc.) and the system that involves the use of AGW. This analysis is made on the operational characteristics of the different handling systems, through the use of: functional schemes, with the aim to carry out evaluations related to the spatial, organizational and relational structure of container yard equipped with different handling unit; network models (graphical representation of links and paths; basic cost parameters) for the schematization and simulation of container handling in the yard; cost models for quantitative evaluation of monetary and temporal impacts, that derive from the use of different handling unit in the yard.}

This paper analyses the intersection of two clear trends in the evolution of port systems, decentralisation of port governance and deconcentration of port traffic. The goal is to identify how the institutional setting governing the spatial diversification of container port activity has changed as a result of this intersection and whether it is suitable to deal with new challenges as they arise. An additional question is whether the new institutional settings created by port reform in developing countries are suitable to support the successful application of port devolution policies imported from developed countries with different political and institutional histories. Based on four national case studies of port reform in Latin America, the paper discusses how the interplay between structure and agency in the reform of port governance has in some cases created merely a “new” path dependency. Findings show that short-term gains in technical efficiency in individual ports contrast with a long-term loss of power from the public to the private sector and the lack of integrated transport and logistics policies necessary to support ongoing port development.}

abstract = {Ports compete not only on the sea-side (e.g. through terminal investments, increase in terminal efficiency, maritime service connectivity) but also on the land-side (e.g. through logistics chain, advanced IT services, door-to-door connectivity). On this issue, several studies (e.g. Meersman et al., 2009; Tongzon, 2009) recently pointed out the increasing importance of the connectivity – at both quality and quantity level – between the port and its own hinterland in order to be competitive in the modern maritime service structure. The analysis concentrates on the study of the port hinterland contestability and on the definition of the catchment area focusing on a case study (i.e. the Adriatic ports aiming at attracting the Southern German freight flows) in order to better understand which elements affect the possibility to expand the current ports’ hinterland. The empirical research is based on public statistics (e.g. Eurostat, Amadeus database) and on data directly collected from the operators currently serving Southern German firms with the main commercial ports and with the potential port actors that may be interested in an enlargement of the port catchment area in the studied region (e.g. South European ports). Apart from the trade pattern analysis – based on the general statistics – and the logistics structure analysis – based on the information collected by transport and logistics operators –, a direct survey has been conducted on a sample of manufacturing companies located in Southern Germany and Western Austria in order to understand what actions should be taken in order to promote the use of Adriatic ports and then reshape the boundaries of the catchment areas of these ports. Statistical tools and a bottom-up approach have been developed in order to evaluate the results. Main findings are then related to potential strategies that may fill in the competitive gap between Northern and Southern European ports when they compete to serve the same hinterland. The original contribution of the research is an insight on the relative importance of the infrastructure endowment, the generalized transport cost and also of some non-monetary conditions – as cultural and behavioural aspects – that have an influence in determining the effective boundaries of ports’ hinterland.}

We briefly survey the applications of control theory to engineering and management problems in supply chains and operations areas during the period 1960-2017. Our analysis is based on bridging the fundamentals of control and systems theory to supply chains and operations management. Although operations and supply chain systems resemble control systems, they have some peculiarities which do not allow a direct application of control theoretic methods. The required modifications and possible limitations are discussed. In this setting, further development of interdisciplinary approaches to supply chain optimization is argued.}

abstract = {The leather industry of Bangladesh is facing considerable amounts of pressure to adopt sustainable supply chain management (SSCM). While there are some studies that have examined barriers to SSCM practices in developed and developing countries in various domains, these are not necessarily applicable to the Bangladeshi leather industry. To bridge this gap, it is crucial to identify most influential barriers to SSCM practices, particularly in the context of developing economies. Therefore, this study identifies such barriers and examines the causal relationships between them with an aim to facilitate the effective implementation of SSCM in the Bangladeshi leather processing industry. Thirty-five barriers to SSCM implementation were identified through a detailed literature review and a survey of leather processing industry experts. Among them, the most common 20 barriers were selected with the help of industry experts. Then, a blended, grey-based Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) approach was utilized to examine their interrelationships. The results demonstrate that nine barriers could be classified as “causal” and eleven as “influenced”. ‘Lack of awareness of local customers in green products’ and ‘lack of commitment from top management’ took high priority in the causal group. ‘Lack of reverse logistics practices’ and ‘Outdated machineries’ were the most influenced barriers. This research uses a leather processing company as a case study for demonstrating the proposed model. The findings aim to support the leather processing industry in a structural way, so that industrial managers can identify the most influential barriers and work to eliminate them. This study may be useful to stakeholders to achieve sustainable development.}

They are increasingly becoming popular for last mile deliveries. However, due to their limited range, they require frequent visits to recharging stations while delivering products to customers along their route. Long recharging times at available stations can have an adverse impact on route planning especially when short delivery time windows are considered. Battery swapping has the potential to reduce recharging times by replacing the vehicles' batteries with fully charged batteries. However, each battery swap is expensive than traditional recharging methods. In this paper, we present a variant of the Electric Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows and Recharging Stations by allowing the available stations to serve both as Recharging Stations (RSs) and Battery Swapping Stations (BSSs). To the best of our knowledge, this problem has not been previously addressed in the literature. A model and algorithm for this problem are presented, computational experiments are performed and insights regarding when consideration of BSSs are particularly useful are provided.}

abstract = {Fast fashion is a clothing supply chain model that is intended to respond quickly to the latest fashion trends by frequently updating the clothing products available in stores. The shift towards fast fashion leads to shorter practical service lives for garments. Collaborative consumption is an alternative way of doing business to the conventional model of ownership-based consumption, and one that can potentially reduce the environmental impacts of fashion by prolonging the practical service life of clothes. In this study, we used life cycle assessment to explore the environmental performance of clothing libraries, as one of the possible ways in which collaborative consumption can be implemented, and compared the advantages and disadvantages in relation to conventional business models. Furthermore, the key factors influencing the environmental impact of clothing libraries were investigated. We based our assessment on three key popular garments that are stocked in clothing libraries: jeans, T-shirts and dresses. The results showed the benefits of implementing clothing libraries associated with the garments’ prolonged service lives. Therefore to achieve environmental gains, it is important to substantially increase garment service life. Moreover, the results quantitatively demonstrated the potential risk of problem shifting: increased customer transportation can completely offset the benefits gained from reduced production. This highlighted the need to account for the logistics when implementing collaborative consumption business models.}

We propose a practical and rational strategy that (1) considers all the major capital and operating costs, and utility savings, (2) selects an optimum HEN location with the highest net present value, (3) uses a third-party logistics provider for managing and operating the HEN, and (4) ensures an identical rate of return on investment for all participating enterprises.}

These holons are connected entities of three types (Product, Resource or Order), that interact to bring out a collective intelligence. The formal models of the various holons are described as well as their exploitation via the wireless sensor network technology. An application to the internal logistics of a job shop is presented. A discussion focuses on organizational changes resulting from the exploitation of a WHN to highlight organizational implications of the operationalization of the proposed approach.}

It shows that for any given assembly sequence, the expected cost is reduced when the assembly operations are divided evenly among the subassemblies. It also shows that when the process constraints require more operations in the initial subassemblies, it is recommended to sequence the operations in descending order.}

An intelligent conveyer belt provides an effective method to associate storage and logistics by QR code scanning and information recording. Improving the QR code readability in movement state is the core of implementing continuous chain traceability with this belt. In this paper, a intelligent conveyer belt including automatic conveyer unit, barcode scanning unit, fault remove unit and control display unit was designed. Four factors affected QR readability were selected and the value range was confirmed, which was reading distance, code size, coded characters and belt moving speed. Based on the belt, an Central Composite Inscribed (CCI) experiment of four factors with five levels was designed using Response Surface Methodology (RSM) to obtain the optimal reading parameters. The result shows that the main factors of reading distance, belt moving speed and the interaction between reading distance and code size have the significant effect on QR code readability. Under the optimization condition of 141.45mm reading distance, 34.58mm code size, 100 bytes coded characters and 2.98m/min belt moving speed, the average value of QR code readability was 95%. With the optimization parameters, the intelligent conveyer belt was used in an apple marketing enterprise. The result shows that the continuous traceability between storage and logistic can be implemented with the extended breadth, deepened depth and improved precision.}

The major bottlenecks identified for Childhood Diarrhea management were poor demand generation, unsafe drinking water, poor access to improved sanitation facility and lack of equitable distribution and replenishment mechanisms for Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) packets and Zinc tablets till the front-line worker level. The main strategic options that were suggested for relieving these bottlenecks were Zinc-ORS roll out in scale-up districts, develop Information Education Communication/Behaviour Change Communication (IEC/BCC) plan for childhood diarrhea management at state/district level, use of Drug Logistics Information Management System (DLIMS) software for supply chain management of Zinc-ORS, strengthening of chlorination activity at household level, monitoring implementation of Nirmal Bharat Abhiyaan (NBA) for constructing improved sanitation facilities at household level and to develop an IEC/BCC plan for hygiene promotion and usage of sanitary latrines.

The GVC Typology is assessed for face and nomological validity through testing of its key dimensions in relation to purchasing-logistics integration and supplier performance measures, using an information-processing theory framework. The GVC Typology appears to have considerable face validity as actual supply chain governance structures aligned well with those it proposes. It also has reasonable predictive power with regards to governance dimensions and integration, and in some connections between governance types, integration, and supplier performance. This study provides researchers with the tools to move this typology beyond the “conceptual” stage in their work, allowing for holistic and higher-level assessments of supply chain governance structures and changes. It may also help researchers and managers to consider when and to what extent purchasing-logistics integration should be fostered.}

Unfortunately, it is common to find industrial workstations built without a purposeful design. The design of the workstation, oriented to both users and tasks requirements, allows organisations to increase their production indicators (less time, space and cost) and quality levels. Within the present paper, an assessment tool was developed to address a literature gap regarding the lack of tools to evaluate Workstation Design, particularly in assembly lines. The concept of “Hierarchy of Workstation needs” is introduced for prioritising the requirements to achieve full performance in workstations. The concept is visualised as a pyramid split in four levels to achieve excellence: functionality, effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction. Seven requirements were identified for Workstation Design, namely: “Health and Safety”, “Work environment, cleanliness and orderliness”, “Waste elimination”, “Inventory and material logistics”, “Flexibility”, “Visual Management” and, lastly, “Quality”. An evaluation model and a tool to assess each requirement was developed based on lean and ergonomic aspects and specific for workstation design, which it is difficult to found in other assessment tools. This model has the form of a checklist that is based on the current best practices in Workstation Design of assembly lines. The assessment tool was validated in an automotive assembly line and based on the results obtained, improvements in the associate working zones, workstation dimensions, storage areas or parts feeding system are introduced to improve “Waste elimination” and “Inventory and material logistics”.}

The goal is to hedge against business uncertainties, so as to maximize the robustness of operations, maximize responsiveness by generating operational flexibility at the minimum cost, use of inventories and environmental impact, and to build resilience in global manufacturing, in order to achieve strategic flexibility. The Triple R is achieved by integrating major operational items, including planning, scheduling, real-time optimization and control. This article reviews existing contributions in the field of global manufacturing, and synthesizes these into a single conceptual model of Triple R. The overview is provided in terms of the development of decision support tools and methods, particularly the development of mathematical programming. The review reveals the fact that there have been limited contributions on the social side of sustainability. Environmental impact can be assessed by considering the product life cycle, yet the integration of R&D into global manufacturing operations has received limited contributions. On the modelling side, there are three dominant approaches: transfer pricing, strategic sourcing strategy, and logistics networks design. The paper ends by presenting a conceptual model and providing a methodological procedure for building the Triple R in global manufacturing. We also suggest implementing more advanced modelling and solution methods, which cover not only logistics and transports, but also the integration of concurrent engineering (CE) with aggregate production planning and scheduling.}

From analysis results, we found middle and large trucks registered in other regions traveled to target city in order to carry freight, target city has included many industrial and logistics areas. Freight is transferred through the harbors, large logistics centers, or via locations before being moved to the final destination. During this process, most freight is moved by middle and large trucks, and trailers rather than small trucks for freight import and export. Therefore, these trucks from other areas are inflow more than registered vehicles. Most emissions from diesel trucks had been overestimated in comparison to VKT from applied traffic volumes in target city. From these findings, VKT is essential based on traffic volume and travel speed on road links in order to estimate accurately the emissions of diesel trucks in target city. Our findings support the estimation of the effect of on-road emissions on urban air quality in Korea.}

Enhancing the operation efficiency and mutually ensuring the safety and quality of the handled products are key levers for logistics providers and other operators in temperature-sensitive supply chain. Handling the temperature conditions experienced by the inventory is valuable in warehouses and any other points along the supply chain where products pause for long periods. This paper proposes an original adaptive storage assignment policy for temperature-sensitive products, which enables to mutually manage both efficiency and stock safety goals. This policy is based on a bi-objective integer programming model and an original solving algorithm. We intend our policy for warehouses that handle temperature-sensitive products in presence of high demand and weather seasonality and strong inventory mix turn-over. To the best of authors’ knowledge, this is the first attempt to integrate into a storage assignment policy the issue of stock quality conservation, the optimization of the picking activities, and the management of weather and demand seasonality at the warehouse. A multi-scenario what-if analysis was applied to a 3PL warehouse of biomedical products to validate the policy and explore its insight in a real-world application. This policy autonomously balances the management of the inventory between the efficiency and stock safety levers and records savings of 12% of the picking travel time and up to 20% of the inventory safety. In conclusion, this policy assesses how the warehouse infrastructure can respond to the demand and weather seasonality in accordance with the efficiency and safety requirements.}

abstract = {Urban consolidation centres (UCCs) are a popular measure in city logistics. Although there are numerous pilot projects and test cases, many UCCs are granted only a short life because they fail to attract a sufficient number of customers. Evidence from literature shows that the cost-attractiveness of UCC solutions for their users plays a major importance in their decision to use these facilities. Indeed, since UCCs involve additional service costs for their customers, in order to be financially attractive, they must demonstrate their ability to decrease delivery costs further in the transport chain, through distance or time gains. Despite the significant interest of the practitioners and the research community in these facilities, there is a lack of knowledge and quantitative tools for assessing the costs of delivery operations and the potential savings by use of UCCs. In this paper, authors propose an analytical approach to estimating costs of deliveries with and without the UCC based on the description of the logistics behaviour of the urban stakeholders from the literature. The analytical framework is then applied to a case of a UCC servicing Brussels. The study shows that the main costs of deliveries are time-related costs and that the use of the UCC can indeed decrease them. The main elements that influence the cost attractiveness of the UCCs are the characteristics of a delivery operations (e.g. number of stops, average number of cargo units per stop or the type of actor who performs the delivery), the characteristics of the UCC (e.g. its location, the service price or the possibility of overnight deliveries) and the characteristics of the services area (e.g. size of the town or delivery density).}

abstract = {Travel time perception and learning play a central role in the modeling of day-to-day travel choice dynamics in traffic networks and have attracted the attention of many researchers, specifically for the analysis and operation of intelligent transportation systems and travel demand management scenarios. In this paper, a fuzzy learning model is proposed to capture the mechanism by which travelers update their travel time perceptions from one day to the next, taking into account their experienced travel times. To capture travelers’ mental representations of uncertain travel time involving imprecision and uncertainty, a combined artificial neural network and fuzzy logic (neuro-fuzzy) architecture called adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system is employed. This framework, which utilizes a set of fuzzy if–then rules, can serve as a basis for modeling the qualitative sides of travelers’ knowledge and reasoning processes. From the output of this study, the results of our laboratory-like experiment provide a good fit to the stated data of travelers’ behavior, and may reflect the fact that the neuro-fuzzy approach can be considered a promising method in learning and perception updating models. Finally, the proposed learning model is embedded in a microscopic event-based simulation framework to evaluate its credibility within a day-to-day behavior of the traffic network. The results of the simulation, which converge to the equilibrium state of the test network, are finally presented, implying that the proposed perception updating model operates properly.}

Contracts bind the parties of a contract to the terms of the agreement. When one party breaches the contract, the other party can suffer losses and claim damages, to be recovered from the breaching person. To measure the damage, three measures are used: expectation damage, reliance damage (wasted expenditure), and restitution. In this study, we have attempted to verify the concept of measure of damage and the recovery criteria of reliance damage, based on three cases. Furthermore, this paper discusses the direction of court judgments regarding the criteria measuring reliance damage through case analysis. The two recent cases of CJ Logistics and Fulton showed that the court considers causation and mitigation as criteria for wasted expenditure (reliance damage) under British law. Further case research regarding causation and mitigation under the marine transport contract and charterparty is needed to establish the trend in court judgments and then to provide countermeasures to the parties.}

The ALNS involves ad hoc destroy/repair heuristics and a periodic perturbation procedure. In addition, an efficient feasibility check has been designed for inserting customer. By conducting several computational experiments with Lackner's benchmark, we show that the present approach can solve real-time problems within a very short time while improving the quality of the solution.

abstract = {Change drivers across supply chains arise either from the production area or from the goods circulation area. A change in production can have a stronger impact on supply chains than a change in goods circulation. In particular, innovations inspired by sustainable development concerns which are firstly introduced within the production system, as some authors point out [Blanquart et al. (2008)], may greatly influence logistical organizations. Their introduction within supply chains requires more time [Roussat and Fabbe-Costes (2014)]. Change drivers may be institutional, commercial, technical, or managerial. Their types and features vary across periods and industries. Some may have quick-impact consequences, others will be slow in showing their effects on the whole supply chain. Three types of change drivers are currently main issues when consumer goods are concerned. Measures for preserving natural resources, with waste management and recycling of end-of-life products in order to minimize the consumption of non renewable resources, make up the first type of drivers. The second type is the ever wider use of online purchases, which disturbs B to B and B to C relationships as well as urban logistics and the last mile delivery terms. Thirdly, changes in logistical organizations of mass retailers may direct traffic flows via new logistics hubs. Food products are concerned by these change drivers in a specific way. Although some of them such as schools of fish may be renewable, natural resources must be protected. Reverse logistics processes are mainly confined to packaging because of the very nature of food. Distance purchases are steadily rising. While the market dependency upon mass retail firms is high, short supply circuits relying on local producers also attract consumers. Within the agri-food sector, the industry of fishery and aquaculture products is a major one feeding billion people around the world. In Europe, it employs approximately 267 000 full time equivalent workers [European Union (2014)], provides activity for hundreds of seaports, and positively contributes to local economies in peripheral shore areas. The paper therefore focuses on the situation of fishery and aquaculture products. The analysis highlights the situation of the whole supply chain within this specific food industry, allowing to achieve a non-fragmented view of it. It also clarifies, from a qualitative viewpoint, the respective role of sustainable development-based change drivers and the others, allowing to point out those giving impetus to changes. The analysis relies on a survey of academic literature and specialized publications, and on interviews with experts and key market players. It highlights the specific adaptations of supply chains within this valuable industry fully integrated in a global business world. It points out the first impacts of sustainable development concern decisions compared with those of other change drivers and illustrates how both kinds of impact interact to shape supply chain schemes.}

Current research offers abundant methods aiming at the configuration of GMNs. However, less attention is paid to identifying the need for adapting existing networks and the comparison of enhanced network configurations. In other fields, like for example logistics, performance measurement systems (PMS) are applied to accomplish these tasks. This paper therefore seeks to support the improvement of network configurations by providing a PMS for GMNs. In the course of this research existing PMS are reviewed and a multidimensional evaluation is carried out. The system with the best fit is chosen and transferred to the field of GMNs. Subsequently, performance attributes are deduced from a strategic and operational point of view based on a literature review as well as the application of concepts known from life-cycle-management and systems theory. The proposed PMS is validated by an industrial case study. The results of the multidimensional evaluation show that the concept of selective key figures that is known from the field of logistics has the best fit to serve as a basis for a novel PMS for GMNs. The transferred PMS consists of metrics evaluating the strategic success factors of GMNs like flexibility and delivery reliability on the one hand and possible operational bottlenecks like complexity on the other hand. The validation of the PMS in a real life environment shows that it contributes to overcoming the identified gap in the literature and supports practitioners in the process of enhancing GMNs.}

Some situations in the practice are discussed in the most of past relevant research, i.e., time window and vehicle capability. However, the performance bonus is not considered. In most logistics companies, performance bonus is calculated by the piece. But it is a problem that the method of calculation is not fair for all staff. In this paper, the model not only considers the performance bonus into the VRPTW, but also changes the calculation method to make a load balance between every staff. In the same time, it also makes the calculation of performance bonus more fair for all staff.}

Using field-collected freight parking observation data from New York City, this study estimated a parametric survival model to predict parking durations based on several characteristics of a parked freight vehicle. Results indicated that vehicles delivering different types of items parked for differing durations, while vehicles that parked illegally were likely to park for a shorter period of time. The model was then employed to make predictions regarding how parking durations would differ based on vehicle and delivery characteristics. An elasticity analysis was performed on each significant variable, and planning recommendations were made in order to maximize the amount of vehicles parking legally. Recommendations for future research included expanding the dataset to obtain more accurate estimates and applying the duration model to optimize operations at a business or logistics firm.}

abstract = {Supplier evaluation and selection problem is among the most important of logistics decisions that have been addressed extensively in supply chain management. The same logistics decision is also important in freight transportation since it identifies trade relationships between business establishments and determines commodity flows between production and consumption points. The commodity flows are then used as input to freight transportation models to determine cargo movements and their characteristics including mode choice and shipment size. Various approaches have been proposed to explore this latter problem in previous studies. Traditionally, potential suppliers are evaluated and selected using only price/cost as the influential criteria and the state-of-practice methods. This paper introduces a hybrid agent-based computational economics and optimization approach for supplier selection. The proposed model combines an agent-based multi-criteria supplier evaluation approach with a multi-objective optimization model to capture both behavioral and economical aspects of the supplier selection process. The model uses a system of ordered response models to determine importance weights of the different criteria in supplier evaluation from a buyers’ point of view. The estimated weights are then used to calculate a utility for each potential supplier in the market and rank them. The calculated utilities are then entered into a mathematical programming model in which best suppliers are selected by maximizing the total accrued utility for all buyers and minimizing total shipping costs while balancing the capacity of potential suppliers to ensure market clearing mechanisms. The proposed model, herein, was implemented under an operational agent-based supply chain and freight transportation framework for the Chicago Metropolitan Area.}

abstract = {The global economic structure, with its decentralized production and the consequent increase in freight traffic all over the world, creates considerable problems and challenges for the freight transport sector. This situation has led shipping to become the most suitable and cheapest way to transport goods. Thus, ports are configured as nodes with critical importance in the logistics supply chain as a link between two transport systems, sea and land. Increase in activity at seaports is producing three undesirable effects: increasing road congestion, lack of open space in port installations and a significant environmental impact on seaports. These adverse effects can be mitigated by moving part of the activity inland. Implementation of dry ports is a possible solution and would also provide an opportunity to strengthen intermodal solutions as part of an integrated and more sustainable transport chain, acting as a link between road and railway networks. In this sense, implementation of dry ports allows the separation of the links of the transport chain, thus facilitating the shortest possible routes for the lowest capacity and most polluting means of transport. Thus, the decision of where to locate a dry port demands a thorough analysis of the whole logistics supply chain, with the objective of transferring the largest volume of goods possible from road to more energy efficient means of transport, like rail or short sea shipping, that are less harmful to the environment. However, the decision of where to locate a dry port must also ensure the sustainability of the site. Thus, the main goal of this article is to research the variables influencing the sustainability of dry port location and how this sustainability can be evaluated. With this objective, in this paper we present a methodology for assessing the sustainability of locations by the use of Multicriteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) and Bayesian Networks (BNs). MCDA is used as a way to establish a scoring, whilst BNs were chosen to eliminate arbitrariness in setting the weightings using a technique that allows us to prioritize each variable according to the relationships established in the set of variables. In order to determine the relationships between all the variables involved in the decision, giving us the importance of each factor and variable, we built a K2 BN algorithm. To obtain the scores of each variable, we used a complete cartography analysed by ArcGIS. Recognising that setting the most appropriate location to place a Dry Port is a geographical multidisciplinary problem, with significant economic, social and environmental implications, we consider 41 variables (grouped into 17 factors) which respond to this need. As a case of study, the sustainability of all of the 10 existing dry ports in Spain has been evaluated. In this set of logistics platforms, we found that the most important variables for achieving sustainability are those related to environmental protection, so the sustainability of the locations requires a great respect for the natural environment and the urban environment in which they are framed.}

This paper examines the allocation of power in different service supply chain relationships, analyzing the impact of service level on optimal control power allocation and comparing the differences between the optimal power distribution in service supply chains and that of manufacturing supply chains. We adopt a mathematical model building method to discuss this issue, verifying the theoretical perspectives through empirical studies of China's largest state-owned logistics company, the China Railway Company, and the private ownership enterprise, Tianjin SND Logistics Company. We also develop a conceptual model of the influence of control power on the performance of service supply chains, based on the modeling and case analysis. The conceptual model shows several results: the control power allocation determines the dominant structure of the supply chain; the service provider's wholesale pricing strategy and the service integrator's sales price strategy present different outcomes under various dominant structures of the supply chain, which will greatly affect the performance of the corresponding supply chain; and the relationship between the supply chain dominant structure and the price can be adjusted by the service level.}

This paper focuses on an Austrian organic box scheme, specifically on how its relationship with local farmers is experienced in a process of growth. For data collection, we carried out semi-structured interviews with 19 supplying farmers and conducted a focus group discussion with 11 members of the management staff of the box scheme company. We explore the question: how did the growth of the box scheme influence relationships between supplying farmers and the box scheme in this local organic food system – from the farmers' perspective as well as from the perspective of the box scheme company itself? A major challenge for the box scheme was reconciling its values (e.g. supporting many local organic farms) with practical issues such as logistics and coordination. The box scheme managed its growth by strengthening cooperation with two larger vegetable farms/wholesalers. But its support for diverse local organic farms suffered in this process, and the box scheme was still searching for solutions to efficiently interact with such a high number of suppliers. Having a high number of local producers was central to the box scheme's identity; therefore, internal governance structures needed refinement and reflection. The tension between specific qualities such as procurement from a multitude of local farmers on the one hand, and practical economical and logistical considerations on the other lies at the heart of the experience of scaling up local organic food systems.}

The objectives of this study are to: 1) quantify the growth and biomass dynamics of selected energycane genotypes along the Texas Gulf Coast and 2) estimate the yield penalty and nitrogen removal of different just-in-time harvesting schemes. Field experiments were conducted in three sites along the Texas Gulf Coast with four energycane genotypes. Biomass accumulation varied greatly among genotypes, but relative biomass growth, expressed as a proportion of each genotype's end of season biomass, was similar across years and genotypes for a particular site. On a calendar time basis, relative biomass growth curve became steeper at higher latitudes, indicating a shorter growing season, a narrower harvesting window, and a greater biomass yield penalty for early season harvest. Estimated biomass yield penalties for early August harvest were 60, 44, and 32% of the biomass at crop maturity for the northernmost, intermediate and southernmost site, respectively. Early harvesting of the same amount of biomass tends to remove more nitrogen due to higher organ nitrogen concentration. Combination of organ types harvested also greatly impacts nitrogen removal. Retaining leaf blade materials in the field would remove less nitrogen as compared to harvesting all organs, but will require greater harvesting area. Results from this study highlight the need for a systematic approach to integrate critical time- and site-dependent biomass growth characteristics of energycane in optimizing biomass production and supply logistics.}

It integrates different transport modes and gives shippers and logistics service providers the freedom to deploy different modes of transportation in the same chain and in a flexible way so as to gain the desired outcome according to their priorities in a certain trip. Time, costs and emissions are certainly the three most relevant parameters when talking about a multimodal transportation chain. In most cases the logistics provider has set priorities to conform with, and obviously above mentioned constrains influence each other in an adverse way. With the development of ICT technologies and systems installed on board and on shore and with a simple decision support system fed with input from tracking and tracing systems or traffic monitoring systems, one can easily and flexibly plan his transportation job and maintain his set priority while in parallel keeping the remaining two parameters in control. Down times for example could be eliminated and efficiency gains could be achieved with decreased environmental footprint. The Port of Piraeus is the largest Greek seaport and one of the largest ports in the Mediterranean Sea basin. It exhibits an impressive container traffic growth rate over the last 4 years triggered by its partial privatization and a recently completed hinterland connection to the rail network, which associated the port with the South-Eastern European corridor e.g. the route Far Eastern ports–Piraeus–Prague. The current paper will present an easy to use simple tool to continuously assess even during the transportation event all the alternative modes for a given destination in terms of time cost and emissions. An analytical fully parameterized model will be the basis for this tool which will be run for the chain Shanghai–Piraeus–Prague. The overall scenario is as follows: A container ship is arriving from China to the Piraeus Container Terminal. One of its containers is destined to an inland Enterprise in Prague. The most common way for transportation to Prague is rail, but also truck could be an alternative solution and of course a combination of a Short Sea Shipping part to Thessaloniki and then truck or train to Prague. Emphasis in the calculations will be given to emissions for all the modes and relations will be shown with time and cost. The tool developed is based on the case study above, being however open architecture software it can be expanded and applied to other ports and routes. The final outcome will be an easy and user friendly tool with the possibility to alter different input parameters and receive quickly a useful decision support system for the shipper or the logistics providers. Finally, there are two loops foreseen for the runs of the program. The required input parameters at each stage are either directly fed to the program if available (e.g vessels ETA and position through GPS, VTS, ETC) or calculated if this is not the case.}

The features used in describing this potential were arranged as three sets of variables. They come from three research fields: transport infrastructure (road and rail), storage capacity and activity of companies involved in logistic processes. A taxonomic development indicator (TDI) based on nine variables from the logistics area was calculated. It enabled to classify the voivodeships into four clusters. The first places in the ranking were occupied by the following voivodeships: Wielkopolskie and Mazowieckie, the last positions were taken by Eastern Poland (Świętokrzyskie, Podlaskie, and Lubelskie). Then it was checked whether the ranking would change if the environmental factor was considered. The tenth variable representing air pollution caused by transport was included in the index. The development of the transport infrastructure while limiting the negative impacts on the environment is set as a target in the development strategy of the transport in Poland. The analysis results provide information for authorities to know which regions and cities grow according to the idea of sustainable development of transport. The authorities have to monitor, and modify if necessary, the transport strategy in cities and regions. TDI could be a tool enabling to compare the implementation with the strategic assumptions. Maintaining a similar position in both constructed rankings proves that a region with its capital city can be assessed as one that cares about realization of that idea. The regions which were ranked high could be used in benchmarking analysis as a model. That part of the analysis proved that the best regions have not changed their positions even when the environmental factor was included. They have proved that it is possible to develop their logistics potential and care about environmental issues at the same time.}

However, these resources are highly heterogeneous in terms of the physicochemical properties, spatial distribution and logistics associated costs. These factors are the major bottlenecks hindering the success of biomass energy conversion facilities that use crop residues. The purpose of this study was to develop an integrated GIS-based Fuzzy AHP methodology. This approach combines both spatial and non-spatial factors, such as the logistics factor, transport cost indicators, and technical and geographic restrictions in the study area. The identification of these factors for the actors involved in energy planning provides at a broad-scale multidimensional analysis that allows for the identification of the best sites for a bioenergy plant. This methodology was applied in the department of Santander (Colombia) due to its intense agricultural activity, reflecting the important energy potential of biomass. For three cocoa crop residues evaluated (pruning, rejected and cocoa pod husk), it was possible to identify 12 ideal places to install a bioenergy plant using this approach. The capacity of these biomass plants varies between 52,475 and 146,791 t/year, corresponding to 171 and 479 TJ/year, respectively.}

It consists of operations related to the reuse of products, such as the collection of products from customers and general processes such as repairing, reusing, and recycling.

In this paper, a general closed loop supply chain (CLSC) is examined which includes manufacturer, remanufacturer, and third-party logistics provider (3PLs), which collects used products. The proposed model comprises two phases: in the first phase, a framework which specifies the priority of products and dedicates a supplier for collecting each product, based on fuzzy AHP factors with the intention of decreasing the risk of remanufacturing process. In the second phase, multi-objective integer linear programming is proposed for determining an optimized number of products which should be provided by suppliers, and also the modules and components of each product which should be remanufactured in the CLSC network. The objectives of this study are to minimize the waste and cost of the processes and maximize the profit in the CLSC network. The proposed model is solved numerically using the LINGO software and an optimal solution is presented.}

Three new models are developed to determine reorder intervals in disassembly systems according to fixed disassembly order costs and inventory costs. The first one is a single stage model (one product to disassemble with several requested components) with one reorder interval to determine. The other two are for multi-stage disassembly systems (one reorder interval to be determined for each stage) under nested policies and integer-ratio ratio policies.}

I argue that they most likely leveraged on emerging imperial infrastructure, in order to expand their existing lapidary and pigment production and exchange in the Atacama desert. The Inca Road may thus have served as an unintended stimuli for local economic activities, since it improved transportation logistics, and served as a linear exchange nexus. I further demonstrate how the Inca Road was, to some extent, appropriated to serve local economic purposes. This provides a unique “bottom-up” perspective of how the Inca infrastructure could not be fully controlled by the elites. Thus, the “imperial landscape” created by the Inca Road was more permeable than what the Incas expected and scholars have assumed, despite the physical or ideological coercion elites may have enforced.}

abstract = {Resumen
Con el propósito de fortalecer el conocimiento y la prevención de los desastres por deslizamientos en este trabajo se desarrolla una metodología que integra la cartografía geomorfológica con la elaboración de mapas de susceptibilidad a deslizamientos usando los sistemas de información geográfica (sig) y el método de regresión logística múltiple (rlm). En México se han realizado algunos trabajos aislados con los sig para evaluar la estabilidad de laderas. Sin embargo, hasta ahora no se ha desarrollado ningún método práctico y estandarizado que integre los mapas geomorfológicos con los inventarios de deslizamientos utilizando los sig. Este artículo muestra el análisis llevado a cabo para elaborar un inventario de deslizamientos multitemporal junto con la técnica de análisis y cartografía morfométrica de la cuenca del río El Estado. La cuenca del río El Estado, seleccionada como área de estudio, se localiza en la ladera sudoeste del volcán Citlaltepetl o Pico de Orizaba. Los factores geológicos y geomorfológicos en combinación con la alta precipitación estacional, el alto grado de intemperismo y las laderas escarpadas predisponen sus superficies a deslizamientos. Para evaluar la susceptibilidad por deslizamientos de tierras se elaboró un mapa de inventario de deslizamientos usando fotografías aéreas, a continuación se elaboró la cartografía geomorfométrica (altimétrico, pendientes y geomorfográfico) y se realizó trabajo de campo. Con esta información se modeló la susceptibilidad por deslizamientos usando regresión logística múltiple (rlm) dentro de la plataforma de un sig y se obtuvo el mapa de susceptibilidad por deslizamientos.
With the aim of raising awareness on the prevention of landslide disasters, this work develops a methodology that incorporates geomorphological mapping into the mapping of landslide susceptibility using Geographic Information Systems (gis) and Multiple Logistic Regression (mlr). In Mexico, some studies have evaluated the stability of hillsides using gis. However, these studies set a general framework and guidance (that includes basic concepts and explanations of landslide classification, triggering mechanisms, criteria, considerations, and analysis for landslide hazard reconnaissance, etc.) for preparing a landslide atlas at state and city levels. So far, these have not developed a practical and standardized approach incorporating geomorphological maps into the landslide inventory using gis. This paper describes the analysis conducted to develop an analytical technique and morphometric analysis for a multi-temporal landslide inventory. Three data management levels are used to create gis thematic layers. For the first level, analogue topographic, geological, land-use, and climate paper are converted to raster format, georeferenced, and incorporated as gis thematic layers. For the second level, five layers are derived from topographic elevation data: slope angles, slope curvature, contributing area, flow direction, and saturation. For the third level, thematic maps are derived from the previous two levels of data: a hypsometric map (heuristically classified to highlight altimetric levels), a reclassified slope map (allowing to highlight differences in relief), and a morphographic map (derived from a heuristic reclassification of the slope map to highlight volcanic landforms). The theoretical aspects of geomorphological mapping contribute to set the conceptual basis to support landslide mapping. The gis thematic layers provide context and establish an overall characterization of landslide processes within the watershed. Through the retrieval and on-off switching of layers in the gis system, a base map is created to assist in the digitizing of landslides and the modeling of susceptibility. A landslide inventory is created from aerial photographs, field investigations, and all the above gis thematic layers. El Estado river watershed on the southwestern flank of Pico de Orizaba volcano has been selected as study area. The watershed is located in the southwestern slope of Citlaltepetl or Pico de Orizaba volcano. Geological (the stream channel of El Estado river erodes Tertiary and Quaternary lavas, disjointed volcanoclastic materials such as pyroclastic flows, fall deposits, lahars deposits, and alluvium) and geomorphological factors (steep slopes, energy relief, and vertical erosion) in combination with high seasonal rainfall (annual rainfall averages 1000-1100 mm/yr at > 4000 m a.s.l. and 927 mm/yr at <1500 m a.s.l.), and the high degree of weathering, make the study area susceptible to landslides. To assess landslide susceptibility, a landslide inventory map and geomorphometric cartography (altimetry, slope and geomorphography) were reviewed, and field work was conducted. In the study area, more than one hundred landslides were mapped. Shallow landslides (including debris slides and debris flows) are the predominant type. Shallow landslides predominate on hills capped with ash and pyroclastic deposits. The second major landslide process includes rock falls (which occur where the stream erodes lava flows and lahars) and deep-seated landslides (which occur in ash and pyroclastic deposits where lava flows act as a slip plane). In parallel, the spatial geodatabase of landslides was constructed from standardized gis datasets. Pertinent attributes are recorded on a geo-dataset. These include 1) mass wasting process, 2) level of certainty of the observation, 3) photo identification date, 4) landslide size, 5) landslide activity, 6) landslide parts (head, evacuation zone, deposit), 7) slope shape, 8) field slope gradient, 9) map gradient measured from the 10 m digital elevation model (dem), 10) landslide delivery, 11) land use, 12) elevation at which the landslide started, 13) aerial photograph identification number, 14) landslide area, and 15) researcher comments. Each attribute is standardized by the geo-dataset domains in the gis system. With this information the landslide susceptibility is modeled using mlr within a gis platform. mlr is used to examine the relation between land sliding and several independent variables (elevation, slope, contributing area, land use, geology, and terrain curvature) to create the susceptibility map. With six independent variables, the multiple logistic model susceptibility map tends to overpredict landslides at a 10 m pixel resolution. However, the model is statistically valid and able to predict 79.81% of the existing landslides. The implementation of a landslide inventory and susceptibility mapping techniques demonstrate the feasibility of the method for use in other volcanic areas of Mexico.}

This article presents an overview of on-going technical developments, which have a reduction of the capital investment or operational costs either as a major goal or as a potential outcome. Developments in instrumentation for proton therapy, such as gantries and accelerators, as well as facility layout and efficiency in treatment logistics will be discussed in this context. Some of these developments are indeed expected to reduce the costs. The examples will show, however, that a dramatic cost reduction of proton therapy is not expected in the near future. Although current developments will certainly contribute to a gradual decrease of the treatment costs in the coming years, many steps will still have to be made to achieve a much lower cost per treatment.}

abstract = {Background
Using a survey conducted during the 2013–2014 polio outbreak in Somalia, this study examines attitudinal and knowledge-based threats to oral polio vaccine acceptance and commitment. Findings address a key gap, as most prior research focuses on endemic settings.
Methods
Between November 19 and December 21, 2013, we conducted interviews among 2003 caregivers of children under 5 years in select districts at high risk for polio transmission. Within each district, sample was drawn via a multi-stage cluster design with random route household selection. We calculated the percentage of caregivers who could not confirm recent vaccination and those uncommitted to future vaccination. We compared these percentages among caregivers with varying knowledge and attitudes, focusing on variables identified as threats in endemic settings, using controlled and uncontrolled comparisons. We also examined absolute levels of threat variables.
Results
Only 10% of caregivers could not confirm recent vaccination, but 32% were uncommitted to future vaccination. Being unvaccinated or uncommitted were related to multiple threat variables. For example, compared with relevant counterparts, caregivers were more likely to be unconfirmed and uncommitted if they did not trust vaccinators “a great deal” (unconfirmed: 9% vs. 2%; uncommitted: 49% vs. 28%), which is also true in endemic settings. Unlike endemic settings, symptom knowledge was related to commitment while rumor awareness was low and unrelated to past acceptance or commitment. Levels of trust and perceptions of OPV effectiveness were high, though perceptions of community support and awareness of logistics were lower.
Conclusions
As in endemic settings, outbreak responses will benefit from communications strategies focused on enhancing trust in vaccinators, institutions and the vaccine, alongside making community support visible. Disease facts may help motivate acceptance, and enhanced logistics information may help facilitate caregiver availability at the door. Quelling rumors early may be important to prevent them from becoming threats.}

Designing an optimized supply chain can support the corresponding processes to integrate the resources. However, one of the most important obstacles is the resource limitation.

Reverse logistics is a system of collecting products from end-users to the manufacturing centers for obtaining values from collected materials. In this research, the collection and distribution process of engine oil, which is derived from one of the most valuable natural resources, is considered. A mixed-integer linear programming model for a closed-loop supply chain of used engine oil is proposed and a case study of an oil refinery company is proposed to explore the applicability of the model. Due to uncertainty in the amounts of collected oil in the engine oil reverse logistics, the robust optimization approach is chosen to deal with uncertainty. Two objective functions of maximizing profit and minimizing the risk of the collection are considered. To solve the bi-objective model, augmented ε-constraint approach is utilized. The results depict the merit of the current research.}

abstract = {Introduction
The use of paper for record keeping (or a manual system) has been the order of the day in almost all health care facilities in resource poor countries. This system has presented numerous challenges, which the use of Electronic Medical Records (EMR) seeks to address. The objectives of the study were to identify the facilitators and barriers to EMR implementation in Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital’s (KATH) Emergency Centre (EC) and to identify lessons learned. These will help in implementation of EMR in ECs in similar settings.
Methods
This was a non-interventional, descriptive cross-sectional and purely qualitative study using a semi-structured interview guide for a study population of 24. The interviews were manually recorded and analysed thematically. EMR implementation was piloted in the EC. Some of the EC staff doubled as EMR personnel. An open source EMR was freely downloaded and customised to meet the needs of the EC. The EMR database created was a hybrid one comprising of digital bio-data of patients and scanned copies of their paper EC records.
Results
The facilitators for utilising the system included providing training to staff, the availability of some logistics, and the commitment of staff. The project barriers were funding, full-time information technology expertise, and automatic data and power backups. It was observed that with the provision of adequate human and financial resources, the challenges were overcome and the adoption of the EMR improved.
Discussion
The EMR has been a partial success. The facilitators identified in this study, namely training, provision of logistics, and staff commitment represent foundations to work from. The barriers identified could be addressed with additional funding, provision of information technology expertise, and data and power back up. It is acknowledged that lack of funding could substantially limit EMR implementation.}

abstract = {Increasing consumer awareness of the environmental and social externalities of food supply chains in developed countries instigates the opening of grocery stores that renounce the use of disposable plastic packaging for their entire product range. The opportunities these novel stores offer in moving to an alternative, more sustainable retail system are currently not well understood. Semi-structured interviews with representatives of seven stores across Europe and six food supply chain experts were conducted in order to address this gap. Findings suggest that these stores may induce more resource-efficient behaviour in suppliers and consumers due to the reduction of packaging and food waste. Social benefits range from the support of small, regional farmers, to higher transparency along the supply chain and better informed consumers. However, these benefits come at the expense of consumer convenience due to slower shopping operations and limited product variety. A wider adoption of zero packaging will require influencing consumer behaviour, convincing suppliers to change their packaging practices, and solving the dependency of food logistics on packaging. In order to achieve wide-ranging, significant environmental and social benefits, zero-packaging stores will ultimately have to offer service levels that are comparable to conventional supermarkets. Potential pathways illustrating how zero-packaging could overcome current market limitations are presented.}

We formulate the problem into a stochastic dynamic programming model to minimise the total logistics cost. Four simplified strategies are proposed. Experiments based on a real case study are performed to compare the optimal strategy with four simplified strategies in terms of cost, computing time and practicality. Results show that the seaport can use prestaging to reduce the cost involved and that an appropriate discharging/loading plan can be created in response to different prestaging situations and uncertain scenarios.}

abstract = {This paper proposes a methodology to quantify the economic impacts of relief distribution after disasters based on discrete choice models. The research uses stated choice data about preferences for water purchases under different scenarios of deprivation. The economic impacts are estimated as the change in consumer surplus caused by the deprivation. The estimated models show that the social benefits for timely delivery of critical supplies are considerably larger than the market price under normal conditions. The findings suggest that disregarding the effects of deprivation, or incorrectly estimating the economic value of critical supplies such as water, is bound to produce a significant miss-allocation of resources. The results produced in this paper could be integrated into economically consistent humanitarian logistics mathematical models that could lead to optimal allocation and distribution of critical supplies.}

In China, medical genetics research activities initiated from a poor inner basis but a prosperous outer environment. During the 40 years of reform and opening-up policy, Chinese scientists contributed significantly in the field of medical genetics, garnering considerable attention worldwide. In this review, we highlight the significant findings and/or results discovered by Chinese scientists in monogenic diseases, complex diseases, cancer, genetic diagnosis, as well as gene manipulation and gene therapy. Due to these achievements, China is widely recognized to be at the forefront of medical genetics research and development. However, the significant progress and development that has been achieved could not have been accomplished without sufficient funding and a well-constructed logistics network. The successful implementation of translational and precise medicine sourced from medical genetics will depend on an open ethics policy and intellectual property protection, along with strong support at the national industry level.}
