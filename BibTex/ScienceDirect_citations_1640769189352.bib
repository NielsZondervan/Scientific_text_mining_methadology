abstract = {The already significant volume of freight vehicles moving within city limits is steadily growing, and is expected to continue increasing at an even faster rate. Many European cities, however, have historical urban heritages and constraints that make them a logistics nightmare, where traffic congestion can result from improperly parked vehicles. In this paper, we focus on the location and sizing of commercial parking lay-bys in urban centres, where it is possible to park for a limited amount of time to perform loading/unloading operations and deliveries. The problem has been formulated and addressed with reference to a central district in the city of Bergamo, with a strong commercial presence, and characterized by significant problems of traffic congestion. We present a mixed analytic-Monte Carlo simulation approach in order to find an optimal distribution and relative sizes of the lay-by areas according to the demand and location of the business activities.}

abstract = {Manpower is an important input parameter for both strategic and tactical management levels in agricultural production systems, connected to management tasks such as capacity planning, task times planning, and scheduling. In large scale field operations manpower surplus can lead to an unnecessary increase in operational cost, while, on the other hand, manpower shortages in the absence of appropriate planning can lead to reduced productivity with a high risk for timeliness costs. In this paper, the simulation model reported by Busato [Busato, 2015, A simulation model for a rice-harvesting chain. Biosystems Engineering, 129, 149–159] was extended to incorporate the functionality of the minimisation of manpower in large scale field operations, such as crop harvesting and transportation. Specifically, the model implements the practice where the number of transport units' operators is lower than the number of transport units. The simulation model was validated based on measurements in two harvesting and transport operations. The deviation of the predicted operation parameters as compared to the measured ones was relatively low. Specifically, for the case of area capacity the error in the prediction was 2.2% and 2%, respectively, compared to the measured area capacity in the two operations. Regarding the practice of the reduced number of operators, it was shown that there are significant reductions in required manpower use when fewer operators than the number of transport units are implemented in the operation. For the specific transport units-operators configurations examined, the reduction of manpower use (h ha−1) was in the range of 12%–30%.}

abstract = {To address the challenge of logistics routing decision under uncertain environment, this paper studies a fourth party logistics routing problem (4PLRP) with uncertain delivery time (4PLRPU). A novel 4PLRPU model based on uncertainty theory is proposed by describing the delivery time of a third party logistics (3PL) provider as an uncertain variable. After that, the model is transformed into an equivalent deterministic model, and several improved genetic algorithms are designed to get solutions. To handle the problem of infeasible solutions in the proposed 4PLRPU, an improved node-based genetic algorithm (INGA) and an improved distance-based genetic algorithm (IDGA) are developed to reduce the computing time required to repair infeasible solutions, and an improved genetic algorithm based on the simple graph and Dijkstra algorithm (SDGA) is proposed to avoid the generation of infeasible solutions. Numerical experiments are conducted to investigate the performance of the proposed algorithms and verify the effectiveness of the proposed 4PLRPU model. The results show that INGA and SDGA are more effective than the standard genetic algorithm and IDGA at solving large-scale problems. Additionally, compared with the expected value model, the 4PLRPU model is more robust.}

abstract = {Over the last decades, academics and practitioners have paid much attention to lot-sizing, which determines economic order and production quantities by balancing inventory holding and setup cost. Recently, researchers have started to integrate sustainability issues into lot-sizing models. The focus of these works has been on environmental and economic dimensions of sustainability, however, while only few contributions studied the social aspect of this problem. Especially in in-house logistics, where a high amount of manual material handling is performed, lot-sizing decisions can have a significant impact on workload and human performance, which can have a strong influence on ergonomic parameters and thus worker welfare. The paper at hand extends previous research on ergonomic lot-sizing and introduces a new mathematical model that integrates ergonomic and economic aspects. A rest allowance function is used to take account of recovery periods that help to maintain low levels of fatigue and ergonomic risks. As recovery periods represent non-productive time, the developed integrated model permits to estimate the economic impact of different workload levels. Finally, the model is applied in a numerical study, reflecting a typical manual material handling process. Based on the results of a parametrical analysis, we illustrate the applicability and validity of this approach to different industrial contexts.}

Therefore, recycling and reusing these materials could mitigate environmental impacts and provide economic gains. The present research is aimed at assessing the economic and environmental advantages of adopting Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) reverse logistics for recycling and reuse by three Brazilian manufacturers of electro-electronic products,and three recyclers,two located in Brazil and one located in Switzerland. Specifically, this study maps the processes used by three recyclers. These multiple case studies incorporated both observation and semi-structured interview. The Mass Intensity Factor was used for the environmental impact assessment. We found that the adoption of electronic waste reverse logistics for recycling and reuse resulted in reduction of the environmental impact in the abiotic, biotic, water and air compartments and economic gains for the manufactures and recyclers, indicating a promising market in the Brazil. Another relevant result was the presentation of a simple eco-efficiency tool to be used in organizational practice. This tool provides a performance indicator based on indexes to implement goals for continuous recycling and reuse improvements, aimed at achieving a closed cycle. However, electronic waste recycling and reuse processes in Brazil are decentralized and, therefore, the development of a cooperation network as a whole is complex. Furthermore, precious metal recovery from printed circuit boards is a process carried out specifically by foreign enterprises because the Brazilian manufacturers and recyclers do not have enough technology due the lack of resources for investment. Thus, the Brazilian government has been holding meetings with the manufacturers and recyclers to develop a sectoral agreement in order to support financially the transfer of this technology for recycling of printed circuit boards to Brazil. In addition, this fact contributes to the National Solid Waste Policy, and it increases the financial profitability of Brazilian recyclers because with this process the recyclers could extract precious metals for sale increasing the economic gain.}

Therefore, chemical companies constantly try to optimize the fleets as part of major working capital optimization initiatives. We study a complex rail car fleet optimization problem observed at BASF and an approach to tackle the problem in a sequential way. We develop a mixed integer non-linear programming model to derive suggestions to the questions: (i) How many different rail car sizes in terms of volume are appropriate and what are their optimal volumes? and (ii) For each volume, what is the optimal number of rail cars of this size? The model formulation takes into account various real-world restrictions concerning the volume and weight of the rail cars as well as the tracks that they run on. We propose two solution methods. First, we reformulate the non-linear terms, which results in a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model. This model can be solved in a reasonable amount of time, if the number of different rail car sizes is small (2 or 3). Second, we develop a two-step approach that uses an enumeration scheme in the first stage to find good initial solutions that are fed into the MILP formulation in the second stage. This approach solves the model for larger numbers of different rail car sizes (4 or 5). Through the fleet redesign BASF has realized cost savings of nearly 2 million euros so far.}

Although the antecedents of dependence have been discussed, extant research lacks an understanding of the explanatory mechanisms of how dependence – or even lock-in situations – actually evolve. In this article, we examine the emergence of these aspects in BSRs by analyzing the example of a logistics outsourcing relationship. Using a grounded theory approach in a real-life case involving a German mechanical engineering company and its service provider, we identify four interrelated mechanisms (convincing, tying, complementing and lock-in) that explain dependence and lock-in from a buyer's perspective. Based on our empirical findings, we develop a conceptual model that points to the theoretical importance of the interconnected influences and sub-processes between transactional, mental, and operative bonding effects. Our results inform managerial practice on how to plan and manage BSRs. The model enhances existing research on dependence in BSRs and can serve as a starting point for further investigations into buyer–supplier dependence (BSD) and lock-in in dyadic business relationships.}

Many automobile producers have implemented the so-called “supermarket” concept to transfer material to the assembly line frequently and in small lots. Supermarkets are decentralized logistics areas on the shop floor where parts are intermediately stored for nearby assembly cells, to be ferried there by small transport vehicles (called tow trains or tuggers). This paper tackles the operational problem of drawing up schedules for these tow trains, such that the assembly line never starves for parts while also minimizing in-process inventory, thus satisfying just-in-time goals. We prove strong NP-completeness of the problem and present exact and heuristic solution methods. In a computational study, the procedures are shown to perform very well, solving realistic instances to (near-)optimality in a matter of minutes, clearly outperforming the simple cyclic schedules commonly used in industrial practice. We also provide some managerial insight into the right degree of automation for such a part feeding system.}

Illustrating the monetary advantages of such reconfigurations will guide decision makers to get the most from all available options.

To this end, an initial classification of returns is typically performed based on some easily acquirable usage information, which is inherently - yet not always perfectly - related to their quality. Despite the criticality of the returns classification process and its impact on the reverse supply chain operation and profitability, little work has been done on the determination of the optimal threshold values, used to classify returns into different quality categories, taking into account the inevitable quality assessment inaccuracies. Motivated by multiple related reports from industrial applications, in the present paper the problem of optimizing the returns classification process under partial quality information in a hybrid manufacturing/remanufacturing facility is studied. More specifically, analytical models for the joint optimization of the new and returned products lot-sizing decisions are developed, based on usage information of returns which is only indirectly related to their remanufacturability. Our analysis provides useful insights on the value of information regarding the quality of returns under an indicator-based initial classification process. Numerical evidence on the economic superiority of the proposed models under alternative quality patterns of returns is also provided.}

Advanced biofuels and larger and heavier vehicles have been seen in the literature as one potential logistics solution with which to improve the energy efficiency of the forest industry. The Finnish government aims to create a 100% carbon-neutral energy base by the year 2045, emphasizing the country's renewable forests as a source for energy and biofuel cycles. The purpose of this paper is to discuss how the local biofuel cycling through larger and heavier vehicles may affect the sustainability of wood procurement in the industrial ecosystem by focusing on transport efficiency, cost-efficiency and energy efficiency. The paper presents a quantitative energy-performance analysis from the optimization of results of the multi-objective dynamic biofuel cycle model. Goal programming enables the energy management solution for three biofuel scenarios of larger and heavier vehicles in the 100% carbon-neutral wood procurement of decentralized energy production. Since the basic scenario in 2013, there has been an upward trend in the average payload weight and a transition in 7- to 9-axle vehicle combinations. While the increase in energy efficiency is significant, it is less than half of the government's maximum scenario estimated prior to the regulations. The novelty of this study is in providing the impacts of the local biofuel cycles (5%, 15% and 30%) on the energy efficiency of road freight transportation to create a 100% carbon-neutral energy base for Finland. Furthermore, the results also provide decision support to the ongoing policy debate towards the 100% sustainable wood supply and/or wood procurement of the industrial ecosystems in Europe.}

The uncertainty associated with demand, supply, and all of the cost parameters is addressed by employing robust optimization, where the uncertain parameters are independent and bounded random variables. While the proposed model attempts to minimize the total costs of the relief chain, it implicitly maximizes people's satisfaction level in the affected areas through applying a penalty to shortages of relief commodities. Additionally, a data set derived from a real disaster case study in the Alborz area, which is vulnerable to earthquakes, is applied to test the efficiency of the proposed robust relief chain model compared to its deterministic form. The study analyzes the degree to which each uncertain parameter affects the solution of the relief chain model and consequently helps the decision maker to tune the parameter values more accurately.}

abstract = {Carbon emissions contribute substantially to climate change. Many researchers believe that the construction industry can contribute significantly to carbon dioxide reduction through cleaner and more sustainable building production and construction, e.g. low energy building design and the use of low carbon materials. Nonetheless, the environmental impacts associated with construction process should not be underestimated. Despite that, as construction process is complex and involves many participants, the calculation of carbon emissions during the construction process is never an easy task. Divergence and limitation are found in both the system boundary and carbon sourcing method. This research aims to resolve the problem and facilitate construction managers to identify carbon emissions so as to optimize them through better construction arrangement. In this paper, the system boundary of the construction stage is first defined and the related activities being included in the construction process are identified. A methodology of establishing the sources of carbon emissions during the construction process based on a quota-based method of China is proposed. The calculation model for carbon emissions is established according to the traditional emission factor approach with some modifications. The carbon emitted during the construction process of a case teaching building is calculated using the proposed quota-based carbon tracing (QCT) model. The QCT model not only provides a systematic framework for the tracing of carbon emissions, it could also help construction managers identify low carbon construction methods and logistics schedule in order to maximize the carbon reduction opportunity during the construction stage.}

We consider maximization of capacity of truck vs. minimization of utilization of fuel, carbon emission and production of noise. The problems deal with green logistics for routes crossing the Western Pyrenees in Navarre, Basque Country and La Rioja, Spain. We consider heterogeneous fleet of trucks. Different types of trucks have not only different capacities, but also require different amounts of fuel for operations. Consequently, the amount of carbon emission and noise vary as well. Companies planning delivery routes must consider the trade-off between the financial and environmental aspects of transportation. Efficiency of delivery routes is impacted by truck size and the possibility of dividing long delivery routes into smaller ones. The results of computational experiments modeled after real data from a Spanish food distribution company are reported. Computational results based on formulated optimization models show some balance between fleet size, truck types, utilization of fuel, carbon emission and production of noise. As a result, the company could consider a mixture of trucks sizes and divided routes for smaller trucks. Analyses of obtained results could help logistics managers lead the initiative in environmental conservation by saving fuel and consequently minimizing pollution.}

The world's major airports are directly connected to hundreds of airports without intermediate routes. This connectivity can be described as the network in which the airport becomes a node and the route becomes a connection line. In this regard, this study analyzes the air transport network of 1,060 airports using the social network analysis (SNA) methodology. We consolidated the data from three airline alliances and established a network of 1,060 airports and 5,580 routes in 173 countries. Many previous studies on air transport network examined several specific airports or regions and mainly utilized the internal indicators of airports. Conversely, this study conducted a comprehensive analysis covering 173 countries by using air route, which is an external indicator of airports. This study presented the general characteristics of major countries and regions from the perspective of SNA and compared the individual networks of the United States and China, which have the greatest influence on international air logistics within the scope of the entire network analysis. This study can aid in the understanding of air transport networks and logistics connectivity in inter-city and inter-country transport.}

However, for mid to long-term marine energy development planning, a comprehensive assessment of the global potential for the exploitation of the main offshore resources is required. This work developed and implemented an innovative methodological approach to identify potential zones for wind and wave energy exploitation at the global level, using long-term data series with fine spatial and temporal resolution. The proposed methodology was based on a five-step approach comprised of: (i) a resource assessment, to identify the zones with favorable conditions for energy exploitation; (ii) a structural survivability assessment, to identify feasible areas which would likely ensure the integrity and durability of the wind and wave devices; (iii) a logistics assessment, to evaluate the possibility of carrying out installation, operations, and maintenance activities; (iv) an assessment of the distance to consumer centers, to estimate the feasibility of transmission to the main urban areas; and (v) an estimate of the extractable power of the identified potential zones. For wind power, the United Kingdom (with 1470 TWh/month using a 10-MW turbine) and the United States (1079 TWh/month) were the countries with the highest estimated energy output of the identified potential zones. For wave energy, Brazil and New Zealand presented good opportunities for the development of the wave energy industry, with an estimated extractable power of 372 TWh/month and 286 TWh/month, respectively. The unique preliminary global analysis presented in this work provides guidelines to assist in the development of wave and offshore wind industries, in addition to supporting the management of marine spaces. Moreover, the methodologies can be replicated for other marine activities.}

The model minimizes the social cost to identify a set of potential supply points (SPs) at the highest echelon, where supply items are consolidated and sent to the prepositioning facilities. The sum of logistics and deprivation costs incurred by the population due to the lack of access to goods or services, is considered as the social cost in this model. The deprivation cost is assumed to increase exponentially with the deprivation time. The model also considers pre-disaster and post-disaster purchasing decisions at the SPs, and allows direct shipments from SPs and prepositioned facilities to the demand points. Numerical analysis shows that multiple supply sources can ensure efficient distribution of the supplies and reduce the deprivation costs. The results also indicate that partial prepositioning and post-disaster purchasing can reduce the shortage in emergency supplies.}

We compare and contrast the marking practices on these two very different kinds of artefacts, devoting close attention to what this implies about workshop organisation or the operational sequences behind their manufacture.

To cast light on this topic, we established a framework combining an optimization model with economic analysis to determine the optimal behavior of an individual delivery service provider company and social impacts (e.g., externalities and welfare) in response to policies designed to support EVs, such as purchase subsidy, limited access (zone fee) to congestion/low-emission zones with exemptions for EVs, and vehicle taxes with exemptions for EVs. Numerical experiments showed that the zone fee can increase the company’s total logistics costs but improve the social welfare. It greatly reduced the external cost inside the congestion/low-emission zone with a high population, dense pollution, and heavy traffic. The vehicle taxes and subsidy were found to have the same influence on the company and society, although they have different effects with low tax/subsidy rates because their different effects on vehicle routing plans. Finally, we performed a sensitivity analysis. Local factors at the company and city levels (e.g., types of vehicle and transport network) are also important to designing efficient policies for urban logistics that support EVs.}

This paper aims to investigate and ultimately reduce this uncertainty by comparing four simulation tools, one mathematical optimisation tool and one analytic spreadsheet-based tool applied to select the O&M access vessel fleet that minimizes the total O&M cost of a reference wind farm. The comparison shows that the tools generally agree on the optimal vessel fleet, but only partially agree on the relative ranking of the different vessel fleets in terms of total O&M cost. The robustness of the vessel fleet selection to various input data assumptions was tested, and the ranking was found to be particularly sensitive to the vessels' limiting significant wave height for turbine access. This is also the parameter with the greatest discrepancy between the tools, implying that accurate quantification and modelling of this parameter is crucial. The ranking is moderately sensitive to turbine failure rates and vessel day rates but less sensitive to electricity price and vessel transit speed.}

The model was applied to assess and compare the prospect of three IoT applications — i.e. IoT healthcare, IoT logistics, and IoT energy management, inviting the perception of 31 ICT experts. The results showed that IoT logistics is the most promising IoT application, due to its strong market potential. IoT healthcare is perceived to have strength in wide consumer market demand, but reliability issues and regulation issues were posed.

In this paper, we investigate how consumers perceive remanufactured products relative to used and new products. We construct a database containing 1716 eBay listings, and use that to investigate the factors that influence the differences in prices between used, remanufactured, and new iPods. Our results confirm that remanufactured products are sold at a discount relative to new products. New to the literature on reverse logistics are the following results. For all types of iPods we find evidence that remanufactured products command a premium over their used counterparts. Also, for two types of iPod, a positive description of the product increases the average price for used products relative to remanufactured ones, which suggests that consumers need less reassurance regarding the quality of remanufactured products than used ones. Furthermore, for the third type of iPod, and for all new and remanufactured products, we find no evidence that a positive description significantly affects price. We explain our findings through the lenses of information asymmetry and adverse selection. We also observed that price dispersion is higher for used than for remanufactured products, indicating that remanufacturing may homogenise the quality of products, or at least the way consumers perceive them. We conclude that consumer perception of remanufactured products relative to their used and new counterparts, and hence their willingness to pay, depends in subtle and not yet well-understood ways on the nature of the product.}

In a very demanding market, request for on-time cargo delivery, transport efficiency is a critical issue, and the ability for real-time detection and resolving of all possible obstacles and exceptions becomes a core competency for logistics operators. The work presented here introduces the concept of Smart Cargo, able to autonomously react to its context, find and understand alternatives, compute adaptive behavior, optimizing its own decisions. The Smart Cargo concept, implements a paradigm shift requiring taking the control of computing applications, data, and services away from some central nodes (the “cloud”) to the other logical extreme (the “fog”) of the Internet. Fog provides an intelligent connection of people, processes, data, and things, enabling Smart Cargo to go beyond the existing Intelligent Cargo concept. Fog computing is described here, as a necessary paradigm shift on distributed freight intelligence, allowing multimodal freight transport to achieve real-time situation awareness and reaction, planning with predictions and learning from the environment.}

The problem is extremely challenging due to the complexity of the constraints and the scale of real-world applications. Therefore, efficient solution methods for this problem are one of the most important research issues in this field. However, current research has mainly focused on various sophisticated high-level search strategies in the form of different local search metaheuristics and their hybrids. Little attention has been paid to novel neighbourhood structures which also play a crucial role in the performance of the algorithm. In this research, we propose a new efficient neighbourhood structure that uses the SNDP constraints to its advantage and more importantly appears to have better reachability than the current ones. The effectiveness of this new neighbourhood is evaluated in a basic Tabu Search (TS) metaheuristic and a basic Guided Local Search (GLS) method. Experimental results based on a set of well-known benchmark instances show that the new neighbourhood performs better than the previous arc-flipping neighbourhood. The performance of the TS metaheuristic based on the proposed neighbourhood is further enhanced through fast neighbourhood search heuristics and hybridisation with other approaches.}

The second level concerns the routing of a vehicle fleet from the satellites to serve all of the customers. A feature of the problem is that customers may provide different delivery options, allowing them to pick up their packages at intermediate pickup facilities. The objective is to minimize the total distribution cost. To solve the problem, a hybrid multi-population genetic algorithm is proposed. An effective heuristic algorithm is designed to generate initial solutions, and several procedures are designed to better manage the population as well as exploit and explore the solution space.

To realize a decentralized material supply following the overall aim of a decentralized control of all production and logistics processes, an intelligent bin system is currently developed at the ESB Logistics Learning Factory. This intelligent bin system will be integrated into the self-developed, cloud-based and event-oriented SES system (so-called “Self-Execution System”) which goes beyond the common functionalities and capabilities of traditional Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES). To ensure a holistic integration of the intelligent bin for different material types into the SES framework, the required hard- and software components for the decentrally controlled bin system will be split into a common and an adaptable component.

Due to uncertainties in customer demands, on-time deliveries cannot be ensured frequently. The vehicle capacity may be exceeded along the planned delivery route, and then the vehicle has to return to the depot for reloading of the goods. In this paper, such on-time delivery issues are formulated as a vehicle routing problem with stochastic demands and time windows. Three probabilistic models are proposed to address on-time delivery from different perspectives. The first one aims to search delivery routes with minimum expected total cost. The second one is to maximize the sum of the on-time delivery probabilities to customers. The third one seeks to minimize the expected total cost, while ensuring a given on-time delivery probability to each customer. Having noted that solutions of the proposed models are affected by the recourse policy deployed in cases of route failures, a preventive restocking policy is examined and compared with a detour-to-depot recourse policy. A numerical example indicates that the preventive restocking policy can help obtain better solutions to the proposed models and its effectiveness depends on the solution structure. It is also shown that the third model can be used to determine the minimum number of vehicles required to satisfy customers’ on-time delivery requirements.}

abstract = {In this study we examine the role of environmental sustainability in transport operations in Shipper-Logistics Service Provider (LSP) relationships from the LSP perspective. The research questions posed are as follows: What kinds of firm see environmental sustainability as a component of competitive advantage, and why? How does environmental sustainability manifest itself in firm operations, and why? What pressures are there for environmentally sustainable development, and why? What is the role of environmental sustainability in the selection of LSPs, and why? Data was collected from Finland, using an exceptional combination involving both quantitative and qualitative methods in a survey (600 responses) and in firm interviews (15 LSPs). The findings indicate that large, globally-operating shippers and carriers are the most interested in environmental issues, partly because of external pressures and partly because they see the greening of transport as a potential source of competitive advantage. However, due to the lack of widely accepted methods for measuring the environmental impact of transports, companies cannot easily share the costs and benefits of environmental initiatives between supply chain members nor use such initiatives as marketing arguments to differentiate their offerings. Therefore, environmental sustainability acts in practice more as an order qualifier than as an order winner in the carrier selection process. Despite this, it seems that environmentally proactive LSPs financially outperform their less active peers. We therefore conclude that environmental sustainability can be free, if it is integrated with operational performance and cost indicators that boost competitive advantage. Our study contributes to the intersection of GSCM and logistics, particularly from the LSP point of view.}

abstract = {We consider a vehicle routing problem which seeks to minimize cost subject to service level constraints on several groups of deliveries. This problem captures some essential challenges faced by a logistics provider which operates transportation services for a limited number of partners and should respect contractual obligations on service levels. The problem also generalizes several important classes of vehicle routing problems with profits. To solve it, we propose a compact mathematical formulation, a branch-and-price algorithm, and a hybrid genetic algorithm with population management, which relies on problem-tailored solution representation, crossover and local search operators, as well as an adaptive penalization mechanism establishing a good balance between service levels and costs. Our computational experiments show that the proposed heuristic returns very high-quality solutions for this difficult problem, matches all optimal solutions found for small and medium-scale benchmark instances, and improves upon existing algorithms for two important special cases: the vehicle routing problem with private fleet and common carrier, and the capacitated profitable tour problem. The branch-and-price algorithm also produces new optimal solutions for all three problems.}

However, stochastic models can lead to decisions that consider solely expected values and thus neglect the eventual damage associated with the worst-case scenarios of a disaster. Two-stage stochastic optimization can lead to solutions that present relief supply shortages that could be often prevented. Bearing this in mind, models with risk aversion have been proposed to make decisions that are better suited to humanitarian operations. In this paper, we propose a model for pre-positioning, location and distribution that uses the measure of Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) to better attend to affected people in a disaster. A post-optimization analysis is conducted to evaluate the quality of the solution. The results indicate that a risk-aversion profile can lead to a 100% reduction of shortages that can be avoided.}

This could be improved by densifying feedstock through methods like baling and pelletization, which also have environmental footprint. Thus, this study assessed the environmental impacts of three potential corn stover feedstock supply scenarios incorporating baling and pelletization for a cellulosic biorefinery of 114 million liters per year capacity in the U.S. Midwest. Scenarios included feedstocks transported in bale and pellet formats with and without storage at distributed storage and processing sites. For the three feedstock supply scenarios, the estimated ranges of global warming potential, acidification potential and resource depletion environmental impacts per ton of delivered biomass (at 0% moisture content) were 20–73 kg carbon dioxide equivalent, 0.1–0.2 kg sulfur dioxide equivalent, and 36–52 MJ surplus, respectively, with pelletization process contributing to higher emissions. For supply system with pellets, electricity required for pellet production was the major contributor to the overall emissions. For the geographic locations with higher share of renewable energy mix in the electricity grid (e.g., Western Electricity Coordinating Council grid, Norway), the emissions from all three scenarios were close. With technology advancement in future, larger capacity biorefineries with increased biomass supply area and transportation distance are possible. In such case, enhanced densification, such as pelletization, could further lower the environmental impacts of biomass feedstock supply systems.}

The objective here is to enhance the traditional models for the one-to-one pickup and delivery problem by considering several important factors, such as explicit fuel consumption (which can be translated into emissions), variable vehicle speed and road categorization (i.e., urban, non-urban). Accordingly, the paper proposes a mixed integer programming model for the problem. A case study from the Netherlands shows the applicability of the model in practice. The numerical analyses show that the investigated factors has a significant impact on operational-level logistics decisions and the selected key performance indicators. The results suggest that the proposed green model can achieve significant savings in terms of total transportation cost. The total cost reduction is found to be (i) 3.03% by the use of explicit fuel consumption estimation, (ii) up to 10.7% by accounting for variable vehicle speed and (iii) up to 10.5% by considering road categorization. As total cost involves explicit energy usage estimation, the proposed model has potential to offer a better support to aid sustainable logistics decision-making process.}

In practice, it is needed to formulate and solve real problems through efficient algorithms in a reasonable time. Hence, this paper tries to cover real case problem with a multi-objective model and an integrated forward/reverse logistics network design. Further, the model is customized and implemented for a case study in gold industry where the reverse logistics play crucial role. A new solution approach is applied for the proposed 7-layer network of the case study and the solutions are achieved in order solve the current difficulties of the investigated supply chain. This paper seeks to address how a multi objective logistics model in the gold industry can be created and solved through an efficient meta-heuristic algorithm. A green approach based on the CO2 emission is considered in the network design approach. The developed model includes four echelons in the forward direction and three echelons in the reverse. First, an integer linear programming model is developed to minimize costs and emissions. Then, in order to solve the model, an algorithm based on ant colony optimization is developed. The performance of the proposed algorithm has been compared with the optimum solutions of the LINGO software through various numerical examples based on the random data and real-world instances. The evaluation studies demonstrate that the proposed model is practical and applicable and the developed algorithm is reliable and efficient. The results prove the managerial implications of the model and the solution approach in terms of presenting appropriate modifications to the mangers of the selected supply chain. Further, a Taguchi-based parameter setting is undertaken to ensure using the appropriate parameters for the algorithm.}

The authors show that this problem differs from a cost allocation problem specifically because the concavity condition does not hold necessarily in the CO2 allocation problem. This implies that a traditional cost allocation method cannot be straightforwardly translated into a CO2 allocation problem, and thus, new methods need to be developed. This study proposes four allocation mechanisms that are extensions from the literature and the common practice in industries. In doing so, the authors introduce the concept of carbon efficiency to assess if a particular allocation rule drives companies to carbon emissions reduction. They present analytical properties that show that the current practice of allocating CO2 emissions based on the greenhouse gas protocol, fails to be sensitive to drive companies to the sustainable practice of placing consolidated orders. The authors also conduct an experimental analysis using data of a logistics service provider that operates in Europe. Using the results of the experiments, they show that simple allocation methods can lead to a fair and carbon efficient allocation. In addition, the study provides insights by conducting a sensitivity analysis, and it shows that the CO2 allocations are not substantially susceptible to shipment size estimation errors.}

At the end of 2013, a pilot experiment was carried out in Comé health zone (HZ) in an attempt to optimize the vaccine supply chain. Four commune vaccine storage facilities were replaced by one central HZ facility. This study evaluated the incremental financial needs for the establishment of the new system; compared the economic cost of the supply chain in the Comé HZ before and after the system redesign; and analyzed the changes induced by the pilot project in immunization logistics management.
Method
The purposive sampling method was used to draw a sample from 37 health facilities in the zone for costing evaluation. Data on inputs and prices were collected retrospectively for 2013 and 2014. The analysis used an ingredient-based approach. In addition, 44 semi-structured interviews with health workers for anthropological analysis were completed in 2014.
Results
The incremental financial costs amounted to US$55,148, including US$50,605 for upfront capital investment and US$4543 for ongoing recurrent costs. Annual economic cost per dose administered (including all vaccines distributed through the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI)) in the Comé HZ increased from US$0.09 before system redesign to US$0.15 after implementation, mainly due to a high initial investment and the operational cost of HZ mobile warehouse. Interviews with health workers suggested that the redesigned system was associated with improvements in motivation and professional awareness due to training, supportive supervision, and improved work conditions.
Conclusions
The system redesign involved a considerable investment at HZ level. Benefits were found in the reduction of transportation costs to health posts (HP) and commune health center (CHC) levels, and the strengthening of health workers professional skills at all levels in Comé. The redesigned system contributed to a decrease in funding needs at HP and CHC levels. The benefits of the investment need to be examined after the introduction of new vaccines and after a longer period.}

Facility location decisions play a critical role in strategic design of supply chain and hence have a long-term impact on its cost and environmental performance. In this study, Operations research and Life-cycle impact assessment techniques are used to estimate the burden on local population's health caused by facility location decisions. Specifically, our primary goal is to minimize the impacts on local population's health quantified in terms of Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY). A mixed integer linear programming model is developed based on a case study located in Can Tho city, Vietnam. Geographic information system (GIS) mapping software is used to estimate the number of affected population. The results of the study show that population density along different parts of transportation routes is the main factor influencing the selection of optimal solutions.}

Regarding used tires, the effect on human health and the environment is a matter of great concern for urban authorities. Therefore, in this paper, we analyze the recovery process for discarded tires. In particular, we study a Reverse Supply Chain Network Design (RSCND), which is designed according to three fundamental echelons (i.e. waste collection, processing and customer zones). To this end, the simultaneous application of simulation techniques and optimization algorithms is proposed. Both approaches are framed within a general methodology, which has been taken from the Operations Research literature. We present a case study from a Colombian city. The combined algorithmic approaches, which include discrete simulation and multiobjective optimization, provide sufficient evidence regarding ways to optimally manage fleet size in the RSCND. Experimental results indicate that the discarded tire recovery process can be designed to be more profitable, as well as less environmentally harmful.}

When an airplane diverts, logistics providers must promptly adapt their transportation plans in order to ensure proper delivery despite such an unexpected event. In practice, the different parties in a logistics chain do not exchange real-time information related to flights. This calls for a means to detect diversions that just requires publicly available data, thus being independent of the communication between different parties. The dependence on public data results in a challenge to detect anomalous behavior without knowing the planned flight trajectory. Our work addresses this challenge by introducing a prediction model that just requires information on an airplane's position, velocity, and intended destination. This information is used to distinguish between regular and anomalous behavior. When an airplane displays anomalous behavior for an extended period of time, the model predicts a diversion. A quantitative evaluation shows that this approach is able to detect diverting airplanes with excellent precision and recall even without knowing planned trajectories as required by related research. By utilizing the proposed prediction model, logistics companies gain a significant amount of response time for these cases.}

The cranes, referred to as seaside crane and landside crane, cannot pass each other. Our focus is on peak times, where the minimization of dwell times of vessels at the berth is typically the major objective of port authorities. We allow the seaside crane to drop inbound containers at intermediate positions where the landside crane takes over and delivers the containers to their target slots. Earlier studies have shown that allowing the cranes to cooperate in this manner is beneficial, at least when there are no containers that are already stored in the block at the beginning of the planning horizon and that have to be delivered to the landside handover point by the landside crane within given time windows. In this paper, we analyze if the positive effect of letting the cranes cooperate persists when these latter jobs are present. This might have a critical impact, because these tasks are performed close to the landside whereas supporting the seaside crane is performed rather close to the seaside. We present complexity results and some general problem insights. Furthermore, we introduce lower bounds and develop heuristic procedures that apply these bounds. The performance of the algorithms is evaluated in computational tests.}

This research develops models for closed-loop pallet pooling providers to understand the environmental and economic impact of customer characteristics and design options. First, an analytical model is developed to quantify the effects of repair facility location and pallet service conditions on a pallet pooling system's economic and environmental performance. Next, a simulation model is developed to investigate two common operational policies, crossdocking and take-back, and to quantify the impact of pallet handling and loading conditions and customer network structures on several key performance indicators. Results indicate that pallet handling and loading conditions are the most important factors determining the cost and carbon equivalent emission of a pallet pooling operation. Better pallet handling and appropriate loading increase the percentage of pallets that can be repositioned with little or no repair. This increases the radius within which a closed-loop pallet pooling system is feasible. Under random handling/loading conditions and distances, a crossdocking approach satisfies demand with 28% fewer pallets than a take-back policy. This is due to a quicker reissue time under a crossdocking approach. However, associated costs and emissions of the two policies are nearly identical due to the increased transportation costs associated with crossdocking. The models and insights proposed in this work can help support decision making by pallet pooling providers to determine operational regions and customer selection, among other network design trade-offs.}

The seven most frequently used pieces of equipment were selected as follows: the central processing unit, computer monitor, keyboard, mouse, printer, cellular phone, and landline telephone. Questionnaires were used to register the perceptions of IUs and TAs on the useful life, reason to disposal of the EEs, and on their knowledge about the waste and related legislation. The results showed a downward trend for the useful life perception of the equipment. In both years, the most cited reason for the exchange/disposal was related to end-of-use of EEs and one of the highlighted aspects was the difficulty in elimination. For this reason, some IUs and TAs chose to stock their waste in the workplace or dispose them in the municipal solid waste collection. Moreover, the study identifies informal recycling companies of electronic waste (e-waste) as a market that has increased in Brazil. It was also observed that over time there has not been a major change in knowledge about laws of e-waste; therefore it is necessary to consolidate the country’s e-waste management with the implementation of a reverse logistics which includes electronic institutional users and technical assistances.}

Among the plethora of randomized heuristics, this paper reviews those that contain biased-randomized procedures (BRPs). A BRP is a procedure to select the next constructive ‘movement’ from a list of candidates in which their elements have different probabilities based on some criteria (e.g., ranking, priority rule, heuristic value, etc.). The main idea behind biased randomization is the introduction of a slight modification in the greedy constructive behavior that provides a certain degree of randomness while maintaining the logic behind the heuristic. BRPs can be categorized into two main groups according to how choice probabilities are computed: (i) BRPs using an empirical bias function; and (ii) BRPs using a skewed theoretical probability distribution. This paper analyzes the second group and illustrates, throughout a series of numerical experiments, how these BRPs can benefit from parallel computing in order to significantly outperform heuristics and even simple metaheuristic approaches, thus providing reasonably good solutions in ‘real time’ to different problems in the areas of transportation, logistics, and scheduling.}

A discrete multi-swarm particle swarm optimization (PSO) and a heuristic optimization are proposed to yield the Pareto set of MOCGIRP. Results show that inventory management activities contribute considerably (17–22%) to total cost and emission rate. Additionally, multiple tours performance is consistently better than single tour method.}

abstract = {The transport system is often described as the lifeblood system of modern society. Roads constitute a fundamental part of this system for both passenger and freight transports. Freight transport is expected to increase throughout Europe by 80% until 2050 (EU, 2011). ITF (2015) stated that international freight transport to ports will increase fourfold until 2050. This will, ceteris paribus, result in a severe increase of congestion and incidents. In turn, incidents will worsen congestion even more. This paper, which draws on current work in CEDR and PIARC, describes the role of the road in the freight transport system. The background to this paper comes from reports that state the road network alone cannot cope with the expected increase in transport flows. Important road freight areas and issues about how to reach a more sustainable freight system are identified and discussed in this paper. These discussions include multimodal terminals and operations, autonomous vehicles, ITS, infrastructure usage, economies of scale, and behaviour/educational issues. The function of the road, from a freight perspective, is manifold. It is used for small shipments over short distances as well as their counterparts. Road freight is most often necessary in the beginning and in the end of the multimodal transport chain (first/last mile logistics). Furthermore, road freight is the only mode involved in many door-to-door freight chains, as it is usually the only mode involved. Such a chain might constitute one or several truck movements. Peak car is widely discussed but peak truck/peak freight might be something that needs to be considered for many reasons. The European climate and transport policies push for a modal shift from road to other modes of transportation. To meet this challenge the market-based transport system must develop into a truly multi-modal system. A smarter utilisation of the transport system is important from the perspective of economic, environmental, and social sustainability. However, more importantly there is a need to make road freight more sustainable in itself. Therefore one important role for the road is to try to stimulate and promote the possibilities for modal shift while another is to optimize its characteristics.}

However, while many models assume availability of information on infrastructure status, this is typically not the case in practice. Often, only partial information about infrastructure status is known. Utilizing the similarities in the known data via attributes, we develop a framework to impute incomplete information in limited data environments. We present an application of this framework to a past disaster, the 2010 Haiti earthquake. We build an ArcGIS model to automate the data collection and processing efforts to the extent possible. The study explores the impact of missing data, dispersion of missing data and imputation techniques used in approximating the incomplete information. Our results suggest that lower granularity yields better estimates of the unknown information above a threshold. We also develop publicly available test cases for the broader community.}

This paper develops the basis for an easily implementable decision support tool by building on current planning practices in the humanitarian sector. We draw on an observational study to describe current planning practices, then develop heuristic algorithms that represent the observed planning processes, and compare their solutions to each other and to those of a mixed-integer linear program. We identify key weaknesses to guide the development of more sophisticated heuristics or optimization models that fit with current planning practices. We also find that a simple practice-driven heuristic performs well when it prioritizes deliveries based on destination priority or distance, and we argue that automating such a heuristic in a decision support tool would maintain the simplicity and transparency to enable implementation in practice, and improve planning by saving time and increasing accuracy and consistency.}

abstract = {To address the increase in the amount of Waste of Electrical and Electronic Equipment in Europe (WEEE), in 2003 the European Commission issued its WEEE Directive, introducing an extended producer responsibility (EPR). While there is arguably a relationship between modes of e-waste governance and the successful handling of e-waste, the empirical evidence explaining the performance of different modes of e-waste governance is limited. We address this knowledge gap by proposing a framework for analysing and evaluating e-waste governance, inspired by literature on WEEE, reverse logistics and environmental governance. This framework distinguishes between four success conditions that are seen as indicators for the performance of e-waste governance: inclusion of all stakeholders, overall strategic collaboration, an adequate rule system and knowledge sharing/performance management. In addition, the framework distinguishes between different modes of e-waste governance which are assumed to influence the extent to which the success conditions are met. We applied the framework to the case of Dutch e-waste governance to test its usefulness and derive initial lessons and good practices from it. Our findings show that the Dutch e-waste governance arrangement is performing relatively well in terms of meeting the success conditions. We identified some concrete local (pilot) approaches that added an interactive twist to the Dutch e-waste system, which appears to be conducive to the fulfilment of success conditions. These findings suggest that a combination of ‘hard’ public-private and ‘soft’ interactive modes of governance – combining the strong points of formal rules and voluntary action taking – is desirable.}

Given the irregular e-commerce order arrival patterns, limited time for order processing in e-fulfilment centres, and the guaranteed delivery schedules offered by e-retailers, such as same-day or next-day delivery upon placing an order, logistics service providers (LSPs) must be extremely efficient in handling outsourced e-commerce logistics orders. Without re-engineering the order fulfilment processes, the LSPs are found to have difficulties in executing the order fulfilment process due to the tight handling requirements. This, in turn, delays the subsequent processes in the supply chain, such as last-mile delivery operations, consequently affecting customer satisfaction towards both the retailer and the LSP. In view of the need to improve the efficiency in handling e-commerce orders, this study aims at re-engineering the fulfilment process of e-commerce orders in distribution centres. The concept of warehouse postponement is embedded into a new cloud-based e-order fulfilment pre-processing system (CEPS), by incorporating the genetic algorithm (GA) approach for e-commerce order grouping decision support and a rule-based inference engine for generating operating guidelines and suggesting the use of appropriate handling equipment. Through a case study conducted in a logistics company, the CEPS provides order handling solutions for processing e-commerce logistics orders very efficiently, with a significant reduction in order processing time and traveling distance. In turn, improved operating efficiency in e-commerce order handling allows LSPs to better align strategically with online retailers, who provide customers with aggressive, guaranteed delivery dates.}

The new Waste Act which entered into force in 2013, rose interests in logistics aspects which improve municipality management. Despite many positive aspects which are the result of the new regulations, there is still a lot of chaos and lack of arrangement. Companies and municipalities started to calculate costs which turned out to be much higher than it had been expected. That is why the issues concerning proper management and effectiveness of waste collection are of key importance. Waste management became one of the most important aspects of municipality management, which is very often not only evaluated by scientists, but first and foremost by citizens. The author made an attempt to examine the optimization potential in terms of waste disposal management in Krakow municipality. Improvement in route planning influenced the rise in effectiveness of the performed processes, at the same time lowering the costs of the waste disposal system management. Shortening the time of transport operations caused an increase in transportation fleet availability and possibility to make use of it in the other parts of the city. The study was based on analyzing four routes of municipal waste collection carried out by a disposal company for the Municipal Cleaning Service in Kraków on 4 different days.}

First-level vehicles pick up requests at a distribution center and bring them to intermediate sites. At these locations, the requests are transferred to second-level vehicles, which deliver them. This paper addresses a variant of the 2E-VRP that integrates constraints arising in city logistics such as time window constraints, synchronization constraints, and multiple trips at the second level. The corresponding problem is called the two-echelon multiple-trip vehicle routing problem with satellite synchronization (2E-MTVRP-SS). We propose an adaptive large neighborhood search to solve this problem. Custom destruction and repair heuristics and an efficient feasibility check for moves have been designed and evaluated on modified benchmarks for the VRP with time windows.}

These challenges seek answers to strategic choices and operational directions of a firm for survival. Given these circumstances, the objective of this paper is to reveal strategic and sustainable pathways. It precisely targets two major research questions of 3PL. They are: Would market environment or firm competences affect strategic emphasis to implement sustainable consumption and production (SCP)? Would SCP also affect firm sustainable competitiveness? A composite strategic research model supported by MBV and RBV theories provides affirmative answers to these questions. The questionnaires attracted 163 valid responses and the comprehensive and rigorous data analysis show MBV has six and RBV four strategic sustainable pathways through the firm׳s SCP, 3PL firms are agile in exercising SCP, and IT is capable of directly influencing SCP performance. Theoretically, this research widens MBV and RBV simultaneously to include SCP issues in a novel way, and practically recommends survival pathways for 3PL in Malaysia.}

In this context, the Brazilian Solid Waste Policy (BSWP) was a regulatory milestone in Brazil, submitting WEEE to the mandatory implementation of reverse logistics systems, involving the integration of waste pickers on the shared responsibility for the life cycle of products. This article aims to measure the impact of such legal incentives and the bargaining power obtained by the volume of collected waste on the effective formalization of waste pickers. The proposed model evaluates the sustainability of supply chains in terms of the use of raw materials due to disposal fees, collection, recycling and return of some materials from desktops and laptops using system dynamics methodology. The results show that even in the absence of bargaining power, the formalization of waste pickers occurs due to legal incentives. It is important to ensure the waste pickers cooperatives access to a minimum amount, which requires a level of protection against unfair competition with companies. Regarding the optimal level of environmental policies, even though the formalization time is long, it is still not enough to guarantee the formalization of waste picker cooperatives, which is dependent on their bargaining power. Steel is the material with the largest decrease in acquisition rate of raw material.}

The expectation that smart cities may promote the adoption of scalable solutions that take advantage of information and communication technologies (ICT) to increase their effectiveness, reduce costs and to improve the quality of life is great among academia, business and governmental stakeholders. Traffic management systems in its multiple applications (including re-routing) are an example of ICT solutions that can expectably lead to the purpose pursued by 'smart cities'. This paper develops a performance evaluation of re-routing for passenger and commercial vehicles with a case study in the city of Lisbon, Portugal. The paper examines how the provision of guidance information to drivers affects traffic performance, operational costs and environmental conditions at different spatial references, namely route level and urban network level. The simulation results indicate that the re-routing can not only reduce travel times, but also enhance the efficiency of roads in the city network and as well the traffic performance at the route level of analysis. The improvement at local route levels (such as corridor/route) is more significant than at the city network level. For the urban network level, simulation results suggest that re-routing can bring variations in travel and delays that may reach 2% and 6%, respectively, when a 10% drivers’ compliance rate is considered. Individual drivers are more likely to comply to deviate than urban logistics drivers and bus drivers.}

Recently, researchers have started to integrate sustainability issues into lot-sizing models. The focus of these works has been on environmental and economic dimensions of sustainability, however, while only few contributions studied the social aspect of this problem. Especially in in-house logistics, where a high amount of manual material handling is performed, lot-sizing decisions can have a significant impact on workload and human performance, which can have a strong influence on ergonomic parameters and thus worker welfare. The paper at hand extends previous research on ergonomic lot-sizing and introduces a new mathematical model that integrates ergonomic and economic aspects. A rest allowance function is used to take account of recovery periods that help to maintain low levels of fatigue and ergonomic risks. As recovery periods represent non-productive time, the developed integrated model permits to estimate the economic impact of different workload levels. Finally, the model is applied in a numerical study, reflecting a typical manual material handling process. Based on the results of a parametrical analysis, we illustrate the applicability and validity of this approach to different industrial contexts.}

In this problem inspired by disaster logistics, a single vehicle can perform successive trips to serve a set of affected sites and minimize an emergency criterion, the sum of arrival times. Two mixed integer linear programs, a flow-based model and a set partitioning model, are proposed for small instances with 20 sites. An exact algorithm for larger cases transforms the mt-CCSVRP into a resource-constrained shortest path problem where each node corresponds to one trip and the sites to visit become resources. The resulting problem can be solved via an adaptation of Bellman–Ford algorithm to a directed acyclic graph with resource constraints and a cumulative objective function. Seven dominance rules, two upper bounds and five lower bounds speed up the procedure. Computational results on instances derived from classical benchmark problems for the capacitated VRP indicate that the exact algorithm outperforms a commercial MIP solver on small instances and can solve cases with 40 sites to optimality.}

Given the importance of the benefits associated to the adoption of ICT in the operation of multimodal transport networks, this work uses institutional-related theories in a multiple-case study comprising seven seaports terminals located in two continents. The purpose of the study is to identify key elements that affect and influence the adoption of ICT to support interoperability and connectivity in multi-modal seaport terminal operations. The analysis is used to identify groupings of influence linked to elements comprising institutional-related theories like coercion and mimesis, part of institutional isomorphism, among others.

This gives rise to a multiobjective optimal control problem where, instead of computing a single optimal solution, the set of optimal compromises, the so-called Pareto set, has to be approximated. When it is not possible to compute the entire control trajectory in advance, for instance due to uncertainties or unforeseeable events, model predictive control methods can be applied to control the system during operation in real time. In this article, we present an algorithm for the solution of multiobjective model predictive control problems. In an offline scenario, it can be used to compute the entire set of optimal compromises whereas in a real time scenario, one optimal compromise is computed according to an operator's preference. The results are illustrated using the example of an industrial laundry. A logistics model of the laundry is developed and then utilized in the optimization routine. Results are presented for an offline as well as an online scenario.}

These strategies include warranty–based acquisition, quantity–based acquisition, quality–based acquisition, centrally coordinated logistics operations and third-party logistics (3PL) operations. The proposed research integrates two important aspects of an automobile's closed-loop supply chain strategy. The first aspect is optimal transportation planning for raw material parts, newly manufactured and EOL products in a closed-loop supply chain, using demand, collection rate and capacity of associated facilities in the network as functional parameters. We formulated a mixed integer mathematical model for the closed-loop supply chain network with a multi-echelon inventory, multi-period planning and multi-product scenario, which are used to compute the maximum contribution margin generated through different strategies. The second aspect pertains to using the output of the proposed model in first stage to handle the sequential form of a cooperative game. The proposed two–phase decision model analyzes the realization times and delivery limits of different products as an indicator of swapping different strategies. We analyze three instances to understand and validate the applicability of the model. In these scenarios, sensitivity analysis has been performed to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed model. We present managerial insights, leading to flexibility in decision making. It is observed that the demand, collection rate and capacity of network facilities create highly sensitive trilogy for the contribution margin of proposed network. The outcome of this research firstly confers optimal amounts of mass flows in the closed loop supply chain network from a state of the end product (new products, recycled products and non–recycled used products) to a state of the raw material (ferrous metal, non-ferrous metal and shredder fluff). Secondly, authors culminated a confound dichotomy among all reintegration strategies (conveyance, acquisition and cannibalization) by distinct enumeration and quantification (regarding realization times and delivery limits) of each one to forge a robust planning horizon for original equipment manufacturer.}

abstract = {Cross docking is a valuable logistics strategy given that it provides less inventory holding costs, less transportation costs and fast customer deliveries. Cross docking should also be considered in strategic planning since it provides competitive advantage by reducing firm costs. An efficient vehicle routing may even increase the benefits of the cross docking. This study presents a vehicle routing problem in a cross docking setting with heterogeneous vehicles having different capacities. All the routes begin and end at the cross dock and all the pickup and delivery sites are visited by only one vehicle. The aim of this study is to find the routes that minimize total transportation costs and the fixed costs of the vehicles. A simulated annealing algorithm is proposed to solve the problem. The proposed simulated annealing heuristic presents reasonable solutions in terms of computational time, best cost values and the convergence pattern on the best cost.}

The quantitative benefits of the cooperation were measured via a simulation-based model that (i) optimized inland empty container reuse and (ii) considered a two-dimensional capacity (weight and size) for vehicle types and demands. Inland empty container optimization was integrated with a dynamic vehicle allocation and routing problem with time-window constraints, while the two-dimensional capacity considered minimising total transport costs in a time-varying network with road segment usage constraints by truck type. The simulation model was used to evaluate the status quo and the cooperation scenarios by analysing two weeks of import and export container movements for the port of Brisbane (Australia). The major findings from the study are: (i) the cooperation among shipping companies avoids a significant number of unnecessary truck movements and of storage days for empty containers; (ii) the cooperation translates into truck-sharing and utilisation of larger trucks, which are more environmentally friendly and cost-efficient choices when compared to smaller trucks; (iii) the introduction of a decision support system provides solutions to the freight actors regarding optimal routing and vehicle allocation, based on real-world constraints and dynamics. Remarkably, the savings in the cooperation scenario are substantial, yielding a 40% reduction of fuel consumption and pollutant emissions.}

abstract = {Since 1995 the freight transport performance within Europe has increased annually by 1.2% and is expected to grow further over the coming decades. Being the sources and sinks of transport activities, Europe's cities are strongly affected by the resulting undesirable effects of transportation. This applies in particular to North West Europe (NWE), one of the most urban regions in Europe. NWE therefore stands in urgent need of solutions for efficient urban freight logistics. Focusing on the last mile of freight deliveries the INTERREG IVB NWE project LaMiLo (Last Mile Logistics) addressed this issue. The project promoted Urban Consolidation Centres (UCCs) as they allow and encourage transport consolidation as well as modal shift. Decoupling the last mile at the city borders, large vehicles are used for bundled, long haul transports outside the city whilst sustainable transport means are used inside. In the knowledge that UCC attempts with huge government subsidies have been made several times before but rarely succeeded, the core of the LaMiLo project was to enable environment for UCC operations that accomplish a sustainable last mile and can as well be transformed in successful business models. Thereto, UCC concepts were operationalised and implemented in a number of pilots in metropolitan areas and cities all around NWE:•Paris: A UCC was field-tested to which freight was brought by truck and afterwards delivered by cargo bikes.•Netherlands: Central hubs were put into operation to streamline the home delivery of parcels. Thereto, a Freight Circle service was launched in the cities of Nijmegen and Maastricht which used e-bikes and enabled customer-specific delivery times.•London: A UCC was set up to bundle goods for the public sector which were destined for the boroughs of Camden and its partners Enfield and Waltham.•Brussels: A UCC was launched at the Port of Brussels offering warehouse services and deliveries to retailers in the city. The key results gained from the studies primarily include the demonstration of UCCs as possible last mile solutions. Beyond their economic performance, their environmental effects as well as their social impacts were evaluated. Exemplary results include that all the pilots contributed towards emission reduction and total distance travelled through city centres and residential areas. Gained best practice and lessons learnt about the examined UCC concepts were discussed and shared at transnational level to encourage relating solutions for further cities.}

For this reason, in recent years several city authorities have promoted different measures to foster the implementation of urban consolidation centers. However, only a few real-world publicly promoted initiatives have succeeded due to several operational, financial, and regulatory issues. In this paper, we investigate different city logistics solutions for a mail delivery service in the city of Austin, Texas. We do that by using a model for the multi-depot vehicle routing problem with heterogeneous vehicle fleet for urban consolidation centers (UCCs) based on metaheuristics. The model considers the total costs and the environmental impacts of alternative UCC configurations and policy scenarios. According to the results, combinations of regulations and subsidies addressing both traffic inbound and outbound the facilities could be the most efficient and environmental friendly approaches. Factors like demand and traffic congestion have a significant impact on the overall performance of the solutions.}

A Business-As-Usual Scenario Model (BAUSM), which delineates how carbon footprints from inventory storage and related transportation are captured, is firstly developed as the benchmark model. Based on BAUSM, we then develop three models with different carbon reduction approaches. The first one is constructed by adding a constraint to represent the percentage target of emission reduction. The second one integrates carbon taxes (or cap-and-trade scheme) into inventory management, and the last one takes both reduction target and carbon offset opportunities into account. Our work provides new analytical models, which integrate cost and emissions in transportation and storage under the framework of continuous inventory review (R, Q) policy for stochastic demand. Optimization algorithms are developed for solving models and related properties are investigated to examine the effects of carbon reduction and associated costs of three models. The policy implications of the models are examined and discussed to provide insights for reference of the practitioners and the policy makers.}

While a significant research effort has been devoted to biomass production and conversion processes, the importance of logistics was detected more recently. Indeed, efficient supply chains are essential to provide conversion facilities with sufficient quantities of quality biomass at reasonable prices. As large territories and hundreds of biomass producers are involved, quantitative models are very useful to evaluate and optimize the resources required, the associated costs, the energy consumptions and the environmental impacts. This article surveys the recent research on models for biomass supply chains, from an Operations Research perspective. 124 references, including 72 published since 2010, have been analyzed to present the structures and the activities of these chains, a typology of decisions in three levels (strategic, tactical and operational), and a review of models based either on performance evaluation techniques (e.g., simulation) or mathematical optimization. A conclusion underlines the contributions and shortcomings of current research and suggests possible directions.}

There is the analysis of the sources is made in order to state criteria of the “3PL” improvement problems in transport companies. According to the summed assessment scores a “3PL” service improvement opportunities affecting criteria list is generated. The priority queue is based on the number of points that were given for each criterion; it is expressed as a percentage of their significance. Following a survey of experts, received kits of estimation are processed statistically. Is used the pairwise comparison method. By ranking method, significance of indicators is identified by direct means. Following the survey, there are received ratings of respondents. Respondents’ reliability of the assessment is expressed by concordance coefficient of opinions characterizing the degree of overlap of individual opinions. Findings of research of “3PL” service providers are evaluated by eight factors (cost reduction, operational parameters, the use of information technology systems, flexibility, quality management, collaboration with customers, fixed assets and performance evaluation) as the most significant independent criteria, showing the importance.

Leveraging its traditional role as a petty market center, it relied on an early start and subsequent agglomeration economies to grow these markets. The demand for goods in these markets begot manufacturing of these goods, creating backward linkages. The growth of these markets led to its unique version of internationalization — “shopping tourism” and as a venue for conventions. This pattern of growth, dubbed the “Yiwu model” is distinctive in that it relied on home-grown small trading enterprises, as opposed to the better-known model of large firms — foreign investment nexus found in export zones. Also distinctive is the strong role played by the Yiwu government working hand-in-glove with private entrepreneurs to seize opportunities and overcome challenges. This partnership will need to overcome challenges that come with this model of growth.}

To date, a number of researchers have argued that intensive transportation activities through popular distribution strategies such as Just-In-Time (JIT) could significantly increase carbon emissions within logistics chains. However, a systematic understanding of how JIT distribution affects carbon emissions is still lacking in current literature. In this study, we develop a bi-objective optimization model for a carbon-capped JIT distribution of multiple products in a multi-period and multi-echelon distribution network. The aims are to jointly minimize total logistics cost and to minimize the maximum carbon quota allowed per period (carbon cap). The considered problem is investigated under three different carbon emission constraints namely periodic, cumulative and global. Since the studied problem is NP-Hard, a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) is developed and its parameters are tuned by Taguchi method. For further quality improvement of the developed solution approach, a novel local search approach called modified firefly algorithm incorporates NSGA-II. Different sizes of the problem are considered to compare the performances of the proposed hybrid NSGA-II and the classical one. Finally, the results are presented along with some policy and managerial insights. For policy makers, the findings show the impact of varying the carbon emission cap on total cost and total emissions under JIT distribution concept. From managerial perspectives, we analyze the relationships between average inventory holding and backlog level per period which can assist mangers to identify critical decisions for JIT distribution of products in carbon-capped environment.}

To solve the proposed problem a two-stage approach is proposed. First, we solve an optimization problem whose main decision variable is the density of recycling sites per unit area. This problem is solved assuming that local conditions are similar throughout the region of interest. So, this problem is solved for each point of a grid that divides the region under study, yielding an optimal solution that reflects an approximation of the local optimum density. In the second stage, the solution is refined by identifying specific locations in which recycling centers could be installed, in a manner consistent with the approximate solution obtained in the first stage. Finally, this proposed approach is tested in a case study using data from Santiago, Chile.}

This paper illustrates how axiomatic production theory can be applied to model road freight transport, and proposes a logistics efficiency measure as the function representation. Based thereon, a logistics productivity index that decomposes into technical, cargo mix, vehicle capacity, and efficiency changes is established to determine the rate and drivers of growth. Emphasizing urban logistics, the paper discusses the limited access to reliable data at the micro level and illustrates how local or regional freight transport can be evaluated applying pseudo panel techniques to national freight surveys. Correspondingly, the theoretical productivity index is implemented on a pseudo panel covering the 24 largest cities in Norway between 2008 and 2012, when 12 of them entered a collaboration agreement to promote efficient transport. The results indicate a modest 0.6% average productivity growth. Efficiency change is the key driver of growth, countered by technical stagnation and regress. Negative productivity growth is expected if this trend continues. Moreover, the results do not reveal productivity gains from urban agglomeration or membership of the collaboration agreement, suggesting that prevailing transport and land use policies have so far been unable to foster productivity growth in urban freight transport.}
