abstract = {This paper investigates the collapse behavior of square paper tubes and the influence of tensile-compressive yield asymmetries of paper tube materials by combining the theoretical and experimental methods. An approximate energy absorption theoretical model is developed to predict the mean crushing force of square paper tubes subjected to axial loading. Besides, combined with the remarkable linear regularity of the experimental results, the numerical curve of the effective crushing distance ratio of paper tubes is obtained to improve the applicability of the proposed model. Then the theoretical results taking account of effective crushing distance are in excellent agreement with the experimental results. The proposed model can be used not only for the prediction of energy absorption characteristics of paper tubes in a logistics environment, but also to guide the protective packaging structure design with paper tubes.}

abstract = {Background
Obesity is a major public health issue. This present study aims to verify the relationship between metabolically healthy obesity (MHO) and suicidal thoughts.
Methods
Data were collected from a total of 299,594 medical checkup recipients. Frequency analysis and descriptive statistics were used to analyze participants’ general characteristics. To analyze the relationship between metabolic phenotype and suicidal ideation, we computed the cross-ratios after compensating for age, depression, and insomnia by using multivariate logistics regression analysis.
Results
In an analysis of metabolic phenotype, suicidal thoughts were found to have decreased for moderate waist circumference (74.0–79.1 cm) for women who were >40 years old in the metabolically healthy (MH) group. In contrast, although severe abdominal obesity was associated with increased suicide risk, it was not found to be significantly related to suicide risk when considered together with emotional difficulties such as depression.
Limitations
This study used only self-report test was conducted to evaluate emotional problems.
Conclusions
Severe abdominal obesity did not affect suicidal thoughts for either sex when feelings of depression were considered. However, we confirmed that moderate waist circumference could be a protection factor of suicide for those who were >40 years old in the MH group.}

Taking into account the characteristics of the material distribution problem of the general assembly of offshore lifting equipment, this paper proposes a scheduling method based on the improved Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm by considering vehicle material matching relationships. Firstly, this we establish a vehicle scheduling model for the final assembly logistics distribution process and then propose a two-stage hierarchical solution framework for minimizing the number of vehicles and the transportation distance. Secondly, the optimization aims to minimize the number of vehicles, we obtain the optimal solution by CPLEX Optimizer. The vehicle transportation distance is then optimized by the improved particle swarm optimization algorithm. The initial solution performance of the algorithm is improved by our heuristic rules. The discretization of the problem is achieved by coding, decoding and location updating methods according to the characteristics of the problem. Additionally, the updating mechanism of simulated annealing algorithm is introduced to update the location to avoid the algorithm falling into local optimum. Through case analysis and comparisons, the improved Particle Swarm Optimization based scheduling method proposed in this paper combined with the vehicle-material matching relationship can effectively improve the efficiency of the material distribution with better performance.}

Therefore, the job shop problem is established as a standard model in scheduling research. While classical variants are well studied, the involvement of practically relevant conditions, such as the absence of intermediate buffers and customer-oriented optimization criteria, shows a lack of theoretical understanding. This work provides a study in this research direction by examining the applicability of a scheduling-tailored heuristic search method to the blocking job shop problem with total tardiness minimization. Permutation-based encodings are used to represent a schedule. Appearing redundancy and feasibility issues are discussed. Two well-known neighborhood structures for sequencing problems are applied and an advanced repairing technique to construct feasible blocking job shop schedules is proposed. The computational results obtained by embedding the components in a simulated annealing framework highlight advantages of the heuristic solution approach against existing general-purpose methods.}

In this paper, the safety and economic aspects of the previously introduced concept of an intermediate offshore resource centre (ORC) are evaluated. The ORC goals are to provide an intermediate helicopter landing station and a forward staging area for emergency response. Among many advantages, an ORC mitigates the logistical risk associated with the extended distance from shore support by reducing the response time in the case of accidents. This paper presents a risk-based cost-benefit analysis of the ORC. A probabilistic loss function model is developed based on the costs of historical offshore blowout incidents and their corresponding response times. The cost and benefit model is simulated in a probabilistic framework using a Monte Carlo simulation. The developed methodology and model help to assess the financial viability of an ORC in order to assist in informed decision-making regarding risk reduction measures.}

Only 67 of 1901 editorials published within that period invoke the issue of replication research (3.5% of all editorials). The analysis of editors' academic background indicates that replication research is mentioned mainly by editors with training in psychology, operations research, logistics, and STEM. Editors who discuss the issue usually provide symbolic and substantial support for such research. However, it is often twinned with language and argumentation that contribute to the negative perception of replications as a substandard form of research.

Considering the relatively recent interest in the topic, most authors have highlighted the heterogeneous and explorative approaches adopted so far, indicating a lack of systematic analyses. This is confirmed by the different names given to the same concept (e.g., co-modality, cargo hitching, system with mixed passengers and goods, share-a-ride, integrated passenger and freight logistics, and collaborative passenger and freight transport). This study conducts a comprehensive literature review based on the scientific contributions indexed in Scopus and selected through a semiautomatic data extraction. First, a descriptive analysis is conducted, which includes types of publication, geographical areas, sources of publication, research methods, and research design adopted. Then, a text mining analysis identifies the main content-related aspects, including a semantic investigation of the most frequently occurring terms, their clustering in homogeneous groups, the transport means considered, and the territorial scales that have been investigated. This analysis is used to define the future challenges related to the topic, which span from the provision of more robust quantitative analyses (studies providing real data and adopting ad-hoc models are still very limited) to policy-related issues. However, the definition of a normative framework that integrates both systems is essential to deal with passenger–freight transport in a combined manner.}

A fundamental requirement for the successful coordination of such systems is leveraging the specialization of each agent within the team. This work presents a Receding Horizon Planning (RHP) framework aimed at scheduling tasks for heterogeneous multi-agent teams in a robust manner. In order to allow for the modular addition and removal of different types of agents to the team, the proposed framework accounts for the capabilities that each agent exhibits (e.g. quadrotors are agile and agnostic to rough terrain but are not suited to transport heavy payloads). An instantiation of the proposed RHP is developed and tested for a search and rescue scenario. Moreover, we present an abstracted search and rescue simulation environment, where a heterogeneous team of agents is deployed to simultaneously explore the environment, find and rescue trapped victims, and extinguish spreading fires as quickly as possible. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive simulations comparing the presented framework with various planning horizons to a greedy task allocation scheme.}

In the proposed approach, the task solution is split into an organization scheme, determining formations useful for the current situation, as well as a distributed controller maintaining the formation. Both of these rely on the solution of optimization problems, with the latter drawing from distributed model predictive control theory. The optimization problems are formulated in a way that they can be derived automatically from the intrinsic properties of the considered scenario, e.g. the number of participating robots and the shape of the transported object. Therefore, no human intervention or scenario-specific design steps are necessary while still being able to cater to a wide range of scenarios. Challenging simulation scenarios illustrate the performance achievable with the proposed scheme.}

In response, the contactless channel (i.e., shopping online, self-collecting and returning parcels via delivery lockers) is ideally positioned to fulfil consumers’ shopping/logistics needs while avoiding all unnecessary social interactions. Thus, this study examines the factors that motivate consumers’ migration to the contactless channel by viewing consumers’ channel choice as both health-related and shopping behaviours. Anchored on the synthesised insights of protection motivation theory and automation acceptance theory, the conceptual framework and a series of hypotheses are proposed. A survey instrument is used for data collection, and the data are analysed using structural equation modelling. Our findings reveal that perceived channel characteristics such as compatibility and trust directly contribute to the relative value of the contactless channel; these characteristics are also correlated where trust perception reinforces compatibility perception. The channel characteristics are further influenced by consumers’ perceived susceptibility of COVID-19; that is, susceptibility perception enhances channel compatibility but decreases consumers’ trust in the contactless channel. However, the impacts of susceptibility become insignificant with a low level of severity perception, confirming the stage-based conceptualisation of severity. Furthermore, the severity perception of COVID-19 is found to amplify the positive impacts of susceptibility perception but attenuate its negative impact. Our study promotes a deeper integration between the health and service literature and encourages more interdisciplinary studies in this nexus. Considering the practical context of social distancing, our findings suggest a struggle between compatibility perception and trust concern that shapes consumers’ behaviours.}

Given a set of items with different volume and time window, and several types of bins with variable size and cost, the objective is to select bins with the minimum cost to pack all the items. The total volume packed in the same bin must not exceed the volume capacity, and there must be one common time point among the time windows of the items in the same bin. We first formulate the problem as an integer programming model and then propose three heuristics to solve this problem. Firstly, the classical best-fit heuristic is modified to find an initial solution. An iterative local search based on the shortest path decoder is employed to find more solutions. Lastly, a primal heuristic based on the column generation is utilized. These three heuristics are different and independent. Two categories of instances are generated to test the performance of our approach. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach is effective in solving this problem and finds near-optimal solutions in a short time.}

Second, it maps and comments on the movements (traffic) and stops of trucks within the whole country, providing a clear picture of the Belgian situation, useful for regional planners and logistics companies. Finally, the flows of trucks observed between Belgian locations enable the country to be divided into mathematical communities of places that interact the most. Analyses are performed for sub-categories based on the country of registration, underlining the spatial specificities of freight transit in Belgium. This exploratory spatial data analysis enables to reveal not only multi-level spatial structures associated with urban hierarchies and the transport infrastructure, but also firm locations or political organizations and to consider the complexity and interconnectivity of any measure taken for a more sustainable future.

As an advanced form of green economic development, remanufacturing is gaining attention because of its significant environmental, economic and social benefits. Many countries have formulated relevant policies to support the development of remanufacturing industry for a more sustainable society. As a strategic emerging industry, China's remanufacturing industry has made rapid progress driven by government policies in recent years. This research critically analyzes the management institutions and policy system for the development of remanufacturing industry in China. China's remanufacturing policy system, including one National Law, one Regulation of the State Council, 166 Documents of the State Council and the Ministries and Commissions, is comprehensively reviewed. These policies reflect current issues and set future directions for remanufacturing in China through comparison with the policy of the U.S., Europe and Japan. Suggestions for further improvements are made accordingly. These include: defining clear and specific responsibility of management institutions, modifying the legal and standards system, launching tax incentives for remanufactured products, establishing a standardized reverse logistics system, strengthening the publicity and promotion of remanufactured products, as well as enhancing consumer awareness. This research comprehensively depicts the overall picture of remanufacturing industry in China from the policy and institutional perspective. These findings are useful for the development of remanufacturing in other industrializing countries.}

Quantitative measures of each cross-correlation panel's constructive contribution to the final result are needed to ensure the best result with the shortest recording duration. We investigate the utility of a variety of seismic data features to improve the convergence of EGFs in ambient-noise interferometry with a dataset acquired at the San Emidio Geothermal Field, Nevada. We identify two features, “rms energy” and “kurtosis”, that succeed in distinguishing cross-correlation panels that contribute to EGF convergence from those that degrade the stacked result. Using either of these features allows us to selectively stack data and enhance signal quality at greater offsets and recover weaker arrivals than is possible by stacking all available data. The data used in this study were acquired in May 2019 by a 144-element array of 4.5 Hz geophones recorded by Reftek 130 digitizers in a configuration that was augmented by embedded processors to perform real-time, in-field processing. Such capabilities, coupled with selective stacking strategies, may help minimize the time, cost, and effort required to determine the best possible EGFs.}

abstract = {Business-to-consumer platforms (e.g., Tmall.com and JD.com) demand the efficient retrieval handling of storage systems. The amount of a certain item to be retrieved is often less than a pallet load; thus, dynamically re-assigning the storage locations of nonempty pallets after each retrieval may improve retrieval operational efficiency. We call such a dynamic decision on the location for the returned pallets relocation. We treat the relocation of each non-empty pallet as an operational decision rather than a tactical decision. Due to its dynamic nature, we formulate relocation as a dynamic program that minimizes the total crane travel time. To overcome the computational curse of dimensionality, we propose several heuristic relocation policies that are inspired by conventional storage location assignment policies. Based on the findings from preliminary numerical experiments, we design an approximate dynamic programming-based relocation policy that achieves a greater operational efficiency improvement than the aforementioned heuristics. Through a more extensive set of numerical experiments, we find that random relocation is generally no better than no relocation, and that closest-open relocation is effective across different rack shapes, crane velocity configurations, and retrieval characteristics. Our experiments also show that the approximate dynamic programming-based relocation policy consistently yields further improvement over closest-open relocation, at the expense of higher (but still affordable) computational complexity.}

I analyse empirical evidence from Afghanistan, Colombia, India, Iraq, Libya, Pakistan, the Philippines, Thailand and Yemen from the first six months of 2020. Results suggest that COVID-19 provides little opportunities for health diplomacy and cooperation, but it also has not yet driven grievances to a level where they became relevant for armed conflicts. Four countries have encountered temporary declines in armed conflicts, mostly due to strategic decisions by governments or rebels to account for impeded logistics and to increase their popular support. Armed conflict levels have increased in five countries, with conflict parties exploiting either state weakness or a lack of (international) attention due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a worrisome trend given the tremendous impacts of armed conflict on human security and on the capabilities of countries to deal with health emergencies.}

To undertake a comprehensive scoping review of the literature to address the research question ‘What is the current state of environmental sustainability in general dental practice?’ To provide an effective baseline of data that will consider the drivers, opportunities and recommendations for the implementation of sustainable practice.
Data & sources
The scoping review was conducted for all published literature in the English language that addresses this topic up to the 31st April 2021. The method of the PRISMA-ScR (PRISMA extension for Scoping Reviews was followed. 128 papers included in this scoping review consisted of: Commentary [Letters, editorials, communication and opinion] (n=39); Research (n=60); Literature reviews (n=25); Reports [Policy and legislation] (n=4). Each included record was analysed for emerging themes that were further classified according to their general relevance. The scoping review is considered over two manuscripts, with this second paper focusing on the opportunities, recommendations and best practice to develop and engage with sustainable practice.
Conclusions
Drivers, opportunities and recommendations for best practice to achieve environmentally sustainable goals in oral health care: The lack of public and professional awareness is the greatest driver to engage with a positive change of behaviour and attitudes. Awareness through education is key at all levels and this should be the bedrock of future strategies. Reduction in staff and patient commuter travel through a reduction of the incidence of preventable oral diseases, improved patient care logistics and IT. Reducing waste and increase recycling opportunities, especially for SUPs. Engagement with legislation and policy makers. Engagement with key stakeholders across the dental materials/products supply chain for the management of manufacturing, distribution, procurement, clinical use and waste management.}

BEM/EG low-temperature composite phase-change materials (LTCPCMs), with an EG mass fraction of 5 to 8 % and an EG particle size of 20 to 60 mesh, were prepared and characterised using various analysis techniques. Based on the results, 7 % EG with a size of 20 mesh (20-LTCPCM-7) was selected to enhance the λ of the BEM. Compared with that of the BEM, the λ of 20-LTCPCM-7 had a substantial enhancement of up to 3.2060 W/(m·K). The melting and solidification temperatures (Tm and Ts) of 20-LTCPCM-7 were measured to be 3.45 and 7.02°C, respectively. In addition, the latent heats of melting and solidification (∆Hm and ∆Hs) of 20-LTCPCM-7 were −197.90 and 193.71 J/g, respectively. In addition, the range of the phase-change temperatures (∆T) broadened. The LTCPCMs with different EG particles sizes also had notably higher thermal degradation temperatures of up to ~180°C. The results show that these LTCPCMs are appropriate for applications in solar air conditioning systems and cold chain logistics.}

Moreover, in order to achieve our goal of predicting the accurate stage of cancer, we need an appropriate model which generally results in higher accuracy and ensemble model proves to be the best model for such scenarios. In this study, we are using the existing ensemble techniques along with a combination of supervised machine learning algorithms to develop a new model for breast cancer prediction. We are also using feature selection techniques to enhance the performance of the ensemble model. For this purpose, machine learning algorithms like Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistics Regression and feature selection techniques like Variance threshold and f-test have been taken into consideration. To achieve higher accuracy for the ensemble model, bagging, boosting and stacking techniques are used.}

One of the challenges is the lack of rationalisation for a cost-benefit analysis of automating certain manufacturing and assembly processes within a customer order. The rigidness and complexity of aerospace lifecycle, and tight industry restrictions does not leave much room for high risk innovations in manufacturing and production lines. This research addressed this problem by investigating an automation adoption scenario with BAE Systems, Electronic Systems, which is a UK based aeronautical systems integrator. This paper reports findings from the general manufacturing industry via an industrial survey. These findings are compared with original findings from an empirical study carried out with BAE Systems within the New Product Introduction team to automate product transportation logistics in an environmental test facility. The paper describes the challenges particularly related to skills, and labour workforce required to manipulate heavy standing products in and out of a production line and how their requirements can be addressed within an automation solution package. The solution includes key design factors related to intricate handling of aeronautic systems via the gripping interface design, and the rest of the operational issues surrounding the testing objectives such as transportation, and test setup. The findings are presented in the form of a requirements analysis for businesses looking to automate manually-intensive tasks in the future, and provide some insights into the lessons learnt in the development of the solution to benefit UK manufacturing tactics to some similar challenges.}

A multi-attribute decision making approach is suggested to determine the priorities of affected areas, according to their urgency in terms of entropy weights. Moreover, a robust optimization approach for uncertain-random parameter is developed to cope with uncertainty in different scenarios, and thereafter augmented weighted Tchebycheff method is applied to solve the model.

The analysis has been carried out for a reference week prior to the lockdown and during several weeks of the lockdown in which different restrictions were in place. During these weeks, population distribution is compared during the day and at night and presence profiles are obtained throughout the day for each type of land use. In addition, a spatial multiple regression analysis is carried out to determine the impact of the different land uses on the local population. The results in the reference week, pre-COVID-19, show how the population in activity areas increases in each time slot on a specific day and how in residential areas it decreases. However, during the lockdown, activity areas cease to attract population during the day and the residential areas therefore no longer show a decrease. Only basic essential commercial activities, or others that require the presence of workers (industrial or logistics) maintain some activity during lockdown.}

Here we address this issue in the context of a dynamic and stochastic patient transportation problem, where besides considering new events, we also incorporate stochastic information about future events. We propose different anticipatory algorithms and investigate which algorithm performs best according to the given settings in a real-world application. We therefore address different types of dynamic events, appropriate response times, and the synchronization of real-world data with the plan. In order to test and analyze how the algorithms behave and perform, we apply the concept of a digital twin. The implemented anticipatory algorithms compared here are a sample scenario planning approach and two waiting strategies. The question of the value of more sophisticated algorithms compared to algorithms with less computational effort is investigated. The experimental results show that solution quality benefits from incorporating information about future requests, and that simple waiting strategies prove most suitable for such a highly dynamic environment. We find that in highly stochastic environments, a rescheduling should be done whenever a new event occurs, whereas in less stochastic environments it is better to let the optimization engine run a bit longer and not start reoptimization after every new event.}

More specifically, it focuses on different supply chain designs (green supply chain, sustainable supply chain, reverse logistics, closed-loop supply chain) in a broader application context. It also identifies the most important variables and parameters in inventory modelling from a sustainable perspective. The paper also includes a comparative analysis of the different mathematical programming, simulation and statistical models, and their solution approach, with exact methods, simulation, heuristic or meta-heuristic solution algorithms, the last of which indicate the increasing attention paid by researchers in recent years. The main findings recognise mixed integer linear programming models supported by heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms as the most widely used modelling approach. Minimisation of costs and greenhouse gas emissions are the main objectives of the reviewed approaches, while social aspects are hardly addressed. The main contemplated inventory management parameters are holding costs, quantity to order, safety stock and backorders. Demand is the most frequently shared information. Finally, tactical decisions, as opposed to strategical and operational decisions, are the main ones.}

This study aimed to analyze the influence of macronutrient intake, stress, and prostaglandin levels (pgf2α) on adolescent dysmenorrhea incidence.
Method
This type of study is observational analytic with a cohort study draft done in January–March 2020 at High junior school 21 Makassar. Respondents in this study were grade X and XI students divided into 64 teenagers who had dysmenorrhea and 64 adolescents who did not experience Dysmenrhea. The criteria of the respondent in this study were the reproductive age, already experiencing menstruation, knowing the time and date of menstruation, menstrual cycles were regular, and willing to be respondents. The study used Menstrual Symptoms Questionnaire (MSQ) and used an ultrasonography (ultrasound) examination to perform the sample cervical. Food recall 24 hours to assess the intake of macronutrients, Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS 42) to measure stress levels, and an examination of urine prostaglandin levels using the method Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Urine intake is carried out on the second day as much as 2–5cc. Data were analyzed by the Chi-square test and logistics regression backward.
Result
A multivariate analysis showed a variable that strongly affects dysmenorrhea is stress with the value p=0.000 and the level of prostaglandins with p-value=0.003 compared to other variables.
Conclusion
Stress and prostaglandin levels significantly affect the occurrence of dysmenorrhea in adolescents.}

abstract = {Increasing population, accelerated urbanisation and rise in income generation have led to the increased concern on sustainable production and consumption of food. This has put severe stress on farmers and plantation owners to rapid expansion of crop lands and plantations to meet the demand. However, the expansion has resulted in large scale unplanned deforestation. The proposed work presents a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model to strategies for minimal crop land and plantation expansion based on the predicted future demand of agro-products. The proposed model is based on the concept which used previously to strategies operation of utility systems. In this work, the proposed model is used to determine the minimal lands for expansion (if required) when there is an increased demand. However, if the demand of the agro-product is projected to decrease, then the model identifies the optimised excess existing crop land(s) or plantation(s) that can be removed from the value chain. Based on the optimised result, the cost involved in expansion (i.e., deforestation and planting costs, etc.) and the transport cost can be determined. The selection of truck capacity for the optimised logistics of the agro products from the cropland to the processing facility can also be determined. By minimising the total cost (expansion cost and transport cost), the area of expansion and transportation distance can be minimised to meet the increased demand requirement, thereby resulting in lesser environmental impact. Note that, the model provides strategic optimisation for expansion of croplands and tactical optimisation for the logistics between crop lands and processing facility. A palm oil value chain is solved in this work to illustrate the proposed model. Five different scenarios with increasing and decreasing palm oil demands were solved and their respective results are discussed. The scenarios analyse the expansion in different types of lands — grasslands, tropical forests and peat forests. It is noted that the model selected grasslands over the other land types due to their least expansion cost and Land Use Change (LUC) tax rates; showing that the proposed approach promotes sustainability through cost. At higher palm oil demands scenario, apart from grasslands, tropical or peat forest lands are also seletected for expansion. Sensitivity analysis of increasing palm oil demand on expansion cost and LUC tax rates on total cost is also presented.}

The results show that (1) Based on 16 accident factors, Naive Bayes and Logistics regression achieve the best F1-Score of 78.3 % on raw data set. (2) With AutoML method, severity classification can achieve an average F1-Score of 84 %. (3) The analysis of the confusion matrix shows that the subjective classification of the original data and specific unusual accidents are the sources of misprediction. (4) The “Type of accident” and “Accident reporting and handling” are the most critical factors and “Emergency management” and “Safety training” are important subsystems, both of which greatly affect the severity of the accident. (5) Based on the Decision tree, a set of assessment rules for the severity of construction accidents can be extracted.

Pharmacy educators are responsible for providing appropriate resources for students of all abilities to eliminate barriers to accessible learning. This commentary focuses on the need for schools of pharmacy to provide equally accessible learning for students who are deaf/hard of hearing, including within the area of experiential education, while highlighting the potential challenges and areas for opportunity.
Commentary
Experiential education settings present unique challenges for students who are deaf/hard of hearing and their pharmacy educators due to the variety of educational settings and different learning logistics associated with experiential education in contrast to the learning environment of the classroom. Pandemic conditions have brought additional challenges since masks have limited the ability for students to lip read. The team has identified several resources to assist in the experiential setting.
Implications
In order to provide equally accessible experiential education for students who are deaf/hard of hearing, it is imperative that pharmacy educators work together with other stakeholders such as disability resource centers, experiential site preceptors, and information technology departments to address associated challenges. Lack of literature concerning students with disabilities and experiential education programs in the health sciences shows that this is an area in need of further research and study in order to advance understanding and provide accessible learning for students with diverse needs.}

However, despite the importance of energy-saving effort in the remanufacturing process, its relevancy in the context of CLSCs has not been investigated. This study extends the previous literature on CLSCs with remanufacturing into the CLSCs with simultaneous effects of remanufacturing and energy-saving efforts on environmental sustainability. This study investigates a CLSC including one (re-)manufacturer investing in remanufacturing and energy-saving efforts, two retailers competing on selling items, and two collectors competing on collecting used items. Utilizing channel coordination and game theory approaches, we analyze how competitive sales prices and collection rates are influenced by the remanufacturing and energy-saving efforts. This study sheds new light on the CLSC management and provides theoretical and practical insights into the way managers of CLSC utilize to promote both environmental and economic sustainability. Our findings illuminate the importance of remanufacturing and energy-saving efforts in the collection process.}

Diarrheal diseases which is one of the leading reason behind global mortality and morbidity is more threatening for infants and young children. Childhood diarrhoea is becoming increasingly prevalent disease in developing countries like India. Moreover, it is a major cause of malnutrition that contributes towards third major cause of under 5 mortalities. This has raised a serious concern in the domain of public health.
Objectives
The present study attempts to identify the spatial prevalence and clustering of diarrhoea in India based on National Family and Heath Survey (NFHS-4, 2015–16) and also tries to identify the association of prevalence of diarrheal disease among under 5 children with socio-economic factors.
Methods
The study applies spatial analysis software i.e ArcGIS 10.8 and GeoDa 1.18 including Moran's index and logistics regression to show the spatial prevalence and auto-correlation of diarrhoea among neighbourhood districts and their contextual determinants.
Findings
The study finds a total of 71 districts belong to the hot spot area are mostly from central and eastern costal part of India. Analysis of socio-economic determinants show prevalence of diarrhoea among under 5 children is higher in rural areas, among children not staying in Pacca house, living with unimproved sanitation facilities, belonging to under privileged community (highest among OBC followed by SC/STs), children of younger mothers (<25 years) and “poor’ households considering the wealth index.
Conclusion
The study recommends to target hot-spot districts with high prevalence of diarrhoea and policy level interventions like improved sanitation to reduce the risk of childhood diarrhoea.}

A broad range of interrelated scheduling and routing operations and various synchronization aspects of heterogeneous vehicles are considered in this regard. A novel bi-objective mixed-integer programming model is presented, where the first objective function aims to minimize the total costs of the relief logistics network, and the second one minimizes the total operation times of vehicles. Moreover, due to extensive empirical and analytical errors, preliminary travel and service times are inexact and unreliable. Hence, a novel two-stage data-driven approach is rendered to predict reliable travel and service times. In the first stage, a new hybrid machine learning model is rendered to predict these times, and in the second stage, the distributionally robust optimization with φ-divergence is employed to surmount the unreliability of predicted times. A real case study is examined to illustrate the validity of the proposed model and solution approach. In addition, several simulation experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed solution method in terms of robustness. Finally, the proposed framework can improve the planning by rendering meaningful insights concerning significant parameters' influence over the schedule and routing consequences.}

Trauma Centers integrate Trauma Registrars and Performance Improvement Nurses to drive quality care. Delays in their duties could have negative impacts on outcomes and performance. We aim to investigate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on Trauma Center operations by assessing performance of trauma registry and performance improvement processes across the United States.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was performed utilizing data from two anonymous questionnaires distributed to Trauma Center Association of America members. Descriptive statistics, Fisher's Exact Test, and multivariable logistic regression were performed with statistical significance defined as p<0.05.
Results
90.2% (83) of Trauma Registrars and 85.9% (67) of Performance Improvement personnel reported that their Trauma Centers have treated COVID-19 patients. Among trauma registrars, respondents did not significantly differ in the current status of completing registry cases (p>0.05), during COVID-19 compared to prior (p>0.05), or adjusted odds of COVID-19 delaying completion of entries (p>0.05). Having >2 Performance Improvement Nurses was significantly associated with improved performance during the COVID-19 pandemic (p=0.03) whereas working at a Trauma Center which treats adults-only or mixed patient population (adult and pediatric) was associated with being 1-3 months behind in closing of performance improvement cases (p=0.02).
Conclusion
The negative impact of COVID-19 on Trauma Registrars and Performance Improvement Nurses has been minimal. Adequate staffing/experience seem to mitigate delays and decreased performance. Implementation of expanded staffing, improved training, and evidenced-based revision of Trauma Center logistics may help mitigate future disruptions relating to COVID-19 and allow Trauma Centers to recover and improve their operations.}

abstract = {Mathematical optimization problems including a time dimension abound. For example, logistics, process optimization and production planning tasks must often be optimized for a range of time periods. Usually, these problems incorporating time structure are very large and cannot be solved to global optimality by modern solvers within a reasonable period of time. Therefore, the so-called rolling-horizon approach is often adopted. This approach aims to solve the problem periodically, including additional information from proximately following periods. In this paper, we first investigate several drawbacks of this approach and develop an algorithm that compensates for these drawbacks both theoretically and practically. As a result, the rolling-horizon decomposition methodology is adjusted to enable large scale optimization problems to be solved efficiently. In addition, we introduce conditions that guarantee the quality of the solutions. We further demonstrate the applicability of the method to a variety of challenging optimization problems. We substantiate the findings with computational studies on the lot-sizing problem in production planning, as well as for large-scale real-world instances of the tail-assignment problem in aircraft management. It proves possible to solve large-scale realistic tail-assignment instances efficiently, leading to solutions that are at most a few percent away from a globally optimal solution.}

Examination of abdominal ultrasound, clinical and biochemical profiles, as well as polymerase chain reaction–restriction fragment length polymorphisms of Pro12Ala of PPARγ gene were performed. The association of PPARγ gene Pro12Ala variants with clinical and biochemical parameters was analyzed.
Results
There was no statistically significant difference between NAFLD and control groups in the frequencies of genotypic and allele distribution (P>0.05), while significantly difference of genotypic (P=0.032) and allele (P=0.015) distribution was found between NAFLD and control groups in the obese. Using logistics multivariate regression analysis by adjusting age, sex, body mass index, diabetes, hyperuricemia and dyslipidemia, both Pro12Ala and Ala12Ala polymorphisms were not associated with the presence of NAFLD. However, above two polymorphisms were found to be related to NAFLD in obesity group (odds ratio=0.442, P=0.031 and odds ratio=0.039, P=0.010, respectively)
Conclusion
In Uygur Chinese population, PPARr gene Ala variants reduce the risk of NAFLD in obese individuals.}

During time-critical rescue operations, the safety of the rescue team itself is of utmost importance. Recently, the advantages of drone technology to support emergency operations have gained academic attention; a widespread practical implementation, however, is still not taking place. Therefore, in this study, we investigate drones from a practitioners' point of view. We conducted a series of 11 usability tests with a total of 49 scenarios based on realistic emergency circumstances including 288 participants from Austrian and Italian rescue organizations. Participants predominantly came from the field of mountain rescue, while the involvement of fire fighters, emergency medical personnel, or cave rescuers, as well as drone manufacturers and professional pilots adds to the study's generalizability. The empirical insights derived from the usability tests demonstrate the capabilities of drones to reduce operational risks in rescue missions, thereby increasing the safety and performance of response teams. Rescuers benefit from drone usage, especially in urgent missions such as search and rescue and emergency items delivery, as the technology reduces response times while simultaneously minimizing risk exposure. Results also indicate that the technology facilitates more accurate mission planning and management, contributes to preventive risk reduction, and represents a novel technique for emergency-related geographic surveying. Nevertheless, several improvements in terms of drone–helicopter communication and image analysis are required to further enhance the usability of drones for emergency purposes.}

This also significantly influences the carrier’s pricing decisions because of tax policies in different countries/regions. In this paper, we consider customers’ preference for free shipping and investigate two competing retailers’ free shipping decisions when they rely on a common carrier for cross-border logistics services. We focus on the impact of retail price competition and the carrier’s tax cost, which shows uniqueness in the shipping industry. We derive the supply chain parties’ optimal decisions by the general equilibrium theory and analyze their free shipping incentives based on game-theoretical models. We find that, if the carrier is non-resident, given one retailer’s free shipping, the other one would follow the step when the retail price competition is mild and the carrier faces small tax disparity. Interestingly, the carrier will benefit from the two retailers’ free shipping when the retail price competition is fierce and the tax disparity is small. If the carrier is resident and both retailers offer free shipping, we find that all supply chain parties will be beneficial, resulting in a win–win–win situation.}

abstract = {Soil compaction is a considerable construction activity to ensure safety and durability, notably in the transportation industry. Compaction delay (CD) occurs because of unpredictable cases which may be related to the climatic, environmental, and logistics reasons. Since the time delay in compaction process affects the engineering properties of the materials in road construction, the current study evaluates the effect of CD on mechanical and consolidation characteristics of cement-stabilized subgrade soil. To achieve this purpose, a set of experimental tests including standard compaction, unconfined compressive strength (UCS), and one-dimensional consolidation tests are performed. Samples are mixed with 1.5, 3, 6, and 9% Portland cement on their maximum dry density (MDD) considering different ranges of CD up to 120 min. Delayed samples show a reduction in MDD (3.46–5.43%), and UCS (11.31–37.25%) compared with those of non-delayed ones. Morphological findings from scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis confirmed that the CD has a destructive effect on the mechanical characteristics of the soil–cement samples even in the long run. Correspondingly, delayed samples show lower secant modulus (1.81 times) rather than immediate compacted ones. Furthermore, higher CD yields mixtures with higher compression index and void ratio. Finally, laboratory test results are used to develop MDD and UCS regression models considering the CD parameter. The sensitivity analysis, based on regression models, shows that the MDD and UCS are noticeably influenced by cement content variations.}

When new equipment is released into multiregional markets, managing repairable spare parts provisioning so as to maximize the service profit from an increasing number of installations becomes challenging since the demand for spare parts varies over time across multiregional markets. A two-echelon repairable spare parts service network is studied to support performance-based service under multiregional fleet expansions. This study proposes an adaptive multi-phase basestock policy that dynamically adjusts the basestock levels in the two-echelon warehouses and the repair capacity in the central depot to meet the nonstationary demands. A profit-centric model is formulated that considers linear-step revenue and availability bands. Using the structural properties of the optimization model, a greedy algorithm is developed based on marginal analysis to solve the problem. Numerical experiements are conducted using a case study of a real business problem and its variants to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed model and the greedy algorithm.}

Many researchers are now focusing on additive manufacturing and its potential to change the industrial paradigm in terms of economic, environmental, and social sustainability. One of the most promising areas for additive manufacturing adoption is maintenance, more specifically, manufacturing of spare parts. The customization potential, and excellent small series capabilities of AM can lead to reductions in size of central and local storages, eliminate the need to locate uncommon spare parts in the distribution network, shorten supply chains and diminish the duration and cost of logistics. The case for replacing conventional spare parts with additive manufactured equivalents has been the discussed in various studies focused of the aeronautic sector, however, its potential in other industries remains relatively unexplored. The continuous process industry is characterized by extremely high production volumes with costly machines and downtime. The combination of these characteristics with intermittent spare part demand patterns and the predominance of reactive maintenance, drives companies to keep large spare parts stock, which makes the case for introducing AM in process industry maintenance very appealing. This study focuses on how AM could change maintenance activities/supply chain in process industries and its economic impact using process based cost models. To further illustrate and study the problem, this paper contains a detailed evaluation of AM’s potential and impacts in a case study from the paper and pulp industry.}

At each phase of the food value chain, a significant amount of data is generated that provides important information to the agents involved in processing and flow of food products from farm to fork. Proper handling of food data has a crucial role in providing safe, quality and affordable products to the increasing world population. The independent production of food data, without following any specific guidelines and procedures, often results in inconsistent and incomparable datasets that cannot be directly utilised by multiple users. Data harmonisation means reconciling various types, levels and sources of data in formats that are compatible and comparable, and thus useful for better decision making. In the food sector, one way of performing data harmonisation is to represent food data according to reliable classification and description systems. Another approach towards harmonisation is to match various food concepts to the existing and widely used ontologies. Furthermore, harmonisation is facilitated by following specific guidelines and procedures during data collection processes. This study explores some of the most important tools, frameworks and methodologies for data harmonisation in the food sector.}

It reports on an own exploration initiative conducted by researchers in logistics and computer science, and brings together their complementary expertise. It identifies firstly the ICT solutions used at an operational level and points out the necessities for further integration, functionalities or application development. Secondly, it develops a theoretical model that assists road transport operators in checking whether using a uniform integration layer and data analytics tools is economically feasible. The model shows the fleet size from which significant costs reductions are made. These costs reductions are enabled by implementing a middleware framework and data analytics algorithm that assists human operators in operational planning.}

However, there are many social barriers in subsistence contexts that exclude vulnerable groups from participating in, and benefiting from, the shared value creation process. These social barriers are contextual in nature and arise from sources such as gender-based discrimination or caste-based discrimination. The exclusion of such vulnerable groups undermines the goal of inclusive social innovation and sparks concerns of elite-capture of shared value in subsistence marketplaces. In this paper, we highlight how social enterprises can overcome the concern of elite-capture of shared value by fostering inclusive social innovation in subsistence contexts. Our research draws from a longitudinal inductive study of nine Indian social enterprises operating in industrial markets such as agriculture and logistics. We apply and extend insights from institutional work perspective to uncover three principal mechanisms for fostering inclusive social innovation, namely – a) relational work, b) inclusion work and c) equity work. These mechanisms work in concert to facilitate the a) creation of shared value in subsistence contexts, b) inclusive distribution of shared value, and c) fair distribution of shared value.}

The main findings are: (1) ICT technique adoption is affected by application design and socio-demographic factors, while research in BTs in this area only focuses on application design factors; (2) ICTs and BTs have similar applications in agricultural production (information provision for efficient decisions and production improvement), logistics (tracing), and supply chain (trust-building); (3) ICT techniques are applied more to production improvement, while BTs focus more on using visibility, traceability, and automation to improve transparency and transaction efficiency in whole sectors; (4) in relation to consumption, ICTs focus on balancing supply and demand to achieve market stability, while BTs investigate effects on consumer purchasing decisions. Insights are also proposed for future research based on common challenges in the application of ICT and blockchain in agriculture in the following areas: (i) security and privacy protection; (ii) solutions for scalability and interoperability; (iii) solutions for high cost and high consumption, and demands for high knowledge in technology application; (iv) formulation of policies and regulations related to standard criteria for market stability. This review provides a basis for studying the combination of ICTs and BTs in agriculture and furthers the understanding of their usage by comparison; this has significant implications for technological development and agricultural sustainability.}

Some production systems in the railcar industry are non-responsive to changes in real time thereby leading to reduction in productivity, hence, the need for a FMS that will cater for the dynamics of manufacturing operation. This work proposes a FMS, which encompasses the assembly line, lean production, logistics and quality assurance. The system comprises of the Radio Frequency Identification Technology (RFID) for components identification and process control, arrays of sensors and cameras, automated material storage and supply, standard interfaces such as the interface for the internet of things (IoT), the robotic welding system as well as a robust intelligent control system. A framework for the implementation of the FMS was developed while the simulation of the designed system was performed using the Anylogic 8.2.3. software. Based on the results obtained, there was an inverse relationship between the operating cycle time of the conveyor and the conveyor speed per cycle when the conveyor’s performance was simulated at a speed of 3 m/s and 7 m/s. The results showed that the system can suitably perform the sequence of assembly and quality assurance operations during the manufacturing of railcar subassemblies with minimal interruptions and human intervention. This will promote production of component parts with high structural and dimensional integrity with significant reduction in the manufacturing cycle time and cost.}

This study evaluated logistics, process data, and barriers/facilitators for the implementation and use of C-reactive protein point-of-care testing (CRP POCT) for suspected lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in nursing home (NH) residents.
Design
This process evaluation was performed alongside a cluster randomized, controlled trial (UPCARE study) to evaluate the effect of CRP POCT on antibiotic prescribing for suspected LRTIs in NH residents.
Setting and Participants
Eleven NHs in the Netherlands.
Methods
Data sources for process data regarding intervention quality included a questionnaire among NH staff, logs, reports, and CRP POCT-analyzer records. Barriers and facilitators for implementation were assessed in focus group interviews with physicians and nurses from 3 NHs.
Results
Correct patient selection for CRP POCT and generally continued CRP POCT use indicated good fidelity. The initial training and training of new employees seemed to fit the need, but some POCT-user group sizes had increased over time, which could have impeded frequent use. Users were generally satisfied with CRP POCT and perceived its use feasible and relevant. Facilitators for implementation were initial commitment and active initiation, followed by continued attention and enthusiasm for building routine practice and trust. Short lines of communication between staff, short distance to the POCT-analyzer, 24/7 coverage of staff, and a clear task division facilitated continued attention and routine practice.
Conclusions and Implications
This process evaluation showed sufficient quality of providing CRP POCT in Dutch NHs. We processed findings of intervention quality and implementation knowledge into key recommendations for CRP POCT implementation in this setting. Future research could focus on CRP POCT use in countries with different organization of care in NHs.}

abstract = {Background
Rapid drug desensitization (RDD) becomes a crucial procedure to allow treatment continuation in patients who suffer drug hypersensitivity reactions (DHRs) to chemotherapeutic (CMT) and biological agents (BA).
Objective
The aim of the study was to compare the efficacy and safety of a one-bag dilution protocol (1DP) with a conventional three-bag dilution protocol (3DP) for desensitization of patients with CMT or BA hypersensitivity.
Methods
Retrospective analysis of patients with immediate DHRs to CMT or BA who underwent at least 1 RDD procedure in our department between 2014 and 2019 was performed. Demographical data, clinical history, skin tests, tryptase levels, and risk assessment were registered. The safety, tolerability, occurrence, and severity of breakthrough reactions (BTR) with 3DP and 1DP were compared.
Results
After the allergy workup, 157 patients fulfilled criteria to undergo RDD (137 females, mean age: 60.44 ± 12.6 years). A total of 639 RDDs (543 CMT and 96 BA) were performed using 3DP in 205 (48 patients) and 1DP in 434 (109 patients). Almost all procedures (636) were completed successfully. No BTR occurred in the first RDD in 52% and 51% of the 3DP and 1DP, respectively. Most BTR were mild. Moderate-severe BTR occurred in 17% with 3DP and 9% with 1DP. There were no statistical differences between protocols regarding the rate and severity of BTR.
Conclusions
RDD with 1DP to CMT and BA has equivalent outcomes to a 3DP desensitization in a selected population of patients in terms of efficacy, tolerability, and safety. Moreover, 1DP reduces the time required for RDD and simplifies the logistics.}

abstract = {The use of hybrid computational intelligence is currently broadening in the field of healthcare applications and research. Computational intelligence has played a vital role in health care for a significant period of time, but with the increased popularity and extensive use of these hybrid computational intelligent systems, a shift has been seen also in the field of health care. Hybrid computational intelligence can be implied in the field of decision making, remote monitoring, healthcare logistics, and modern information systems. Hybrid computational intelligence synergizes different computational intelligence techniques, such as the neural network, the fuzzy logic, the genetic algorithms, the evolutionary computation and the support vector machines, and have their application in the field of pattern recognition, system modeling, etc. In this chapter, we focus on the need for healthcare information technology, improvement of healthcare delivery systems, healthcare safety issues, and also various areas where it can be used.}

Weather-sensitive economic sectors (e.g., agriculture, aviation, insurance, logistics) impacted by these mesoscale extreme events have evolved to anticipate and, in some cases, mitigate their impact; however, these expectations may be disrupted by shifts in the climatological frequency, intensity, and efficiency of these storm-scale extremes in a future climate. In addition to a changing climate, it is not yet well understood why some years tally record high SCS reports, whereas others exhibit record low counts. Ultimately, understanding how climate regimes may modify these relatively low probability—but high impact—events could help reduce this uncertainty, thus empowering stakeholders to anticipate change, mitigate impacts, and incorporate resiliency strategies. More research is needed, particularly using novel computational methods such as dynamical downscaling and machine learning to understand the full impact that climate variability and change may have on these extreme weather events.}

Although several enterprises have successfully explored a versatile material management regulation for multiple aerospace projects, the low inventory turnover problem still exist due to the difficulty in versatile material recognition and inventory distribution. This paper studies the dynamic inventory management problem of aerospace project materials. Firstly, a numerical concept space model is established to describe the data characteristics of aerospace project materials. Then, we propose the variable-scale clustering algorithm based on the numerical concept space, which is utilized to automatically recognize versatile materials. Also, the obtained satisfy scale feature supports managers making inventory-related decision. Finally, a dynamic adjustment algorithm of inventory classification based on the variable-scale clustering is proposed, in order to dynamically maintain the inventory management plan of aerospace project materials. Experiments select the inventory data of aerospace project metal materials during Jan 1, 2015 to Mar 31, 2018 from the logistics center in China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology. And experiment results illustrate that our proposed variable-scale clustering algorithm has high efficiency and practical application value in solving dynamic inventory management problem of aerospace project materials.}

While the impacts associated with packaging waste in the food sector are well known, the adoption of reusable crates or handling systems for food items entails many logistics processes such as storage, transportation, and cleaning, whose impact needs to be quantified and assessed with cost-benefit analysis. This chapter thus presents a methodology and a decision-support tool used to quantify the logistic and environmental impacts associated with packaging distribution in the closed-loop network between growers, retailers, and the pooler. This methodology allows quantifying of the performance of the as-is scenario and predicting the savings of choosing intermodal transport solutions (i.e., railways, seaways) for the delivery and collection of reusable plastic crates (RPCs) for fruits and vegetables. The methodology is applied to a multiscenario what-if analysis of a case study provided by an Italian pooler operating in the retail food supply chain. The results are generated through a decision-support tool, which embeds a geographic information system (GIS) and realizes data-driven assessment of storage and distribution operations experienced by RPCs. We quantified some categories of impacts among the set of greenhouse gases emissions (GHGs) resulting from transportation and associated costs. The results showcase a total transportation cost reduction of 11.7% in the to-be scenario, while the number of kilograms of CO2eq decreases by 9.2%. The contribution of this chapter lies in the investigation of the environmental sustainability of a packaging closed-loop network (CLN) for food products. Moreover, we decided to limit the boundaries of the analysis to the transport process, which is often neglected and underrated in typical life cycle assessment (LCA). Findings from this chapter represent practical suggestions and strategic guidelines for managers and practitioners of reusable package systems toward more sustainable operations.}

This proposed attempts to find the vehicle routes with minimizing traveling distance, in which the excellent solution delivers a set of customers in one visit by capacitated vehicle. For solving the CVRP problem, a cooperative hybrid firefly algorithm (CVRP-CHFA) is proposed in this paper with multiple firefly algorithm (FA) populations. Each FA is hybridized with two types of local search (i.e., Improved 2-opt as a local search and 2-h-opt as a mutation operator) and genetic operators. The proposed algorithms (FAs) communicate from time to time for exchanging some solutions (fireflies). The main aim of the hybridization and communication strategies is to maintain the diversity of populations to prevent the proposed algorithm from falling into local optima and overcome the drawbacks of a single swarm FA. The experiments are conducted on 108 instances from eight standard benchmarks. The results revealed that the proposed CVRP-CHFA got promising results compared to other well-known methods. Moreover, the proposed CVRP-CHFA significantly outperformed the recent three hybrid firefly algorithms.}

Optimizing awareness and vaccine uptake for MSM is a high priority to reduce and control IMD outbreaks. To that end, we conducted focus groups with MSM during an active IMD outbreak to inform development of a tailored intervention strategy.

Then, according to the risk categories, a Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) table is proposed for risk assessment of pharmaceutical product shipments and logistics. The evaluations are based on Intuitionistic Fuzzy Numbers (IFNs) to be able to account for the uncertainty in the experts’ judgments. By using an intuitionistic fuzzy hybrid TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) approach, the evaluated risks of each shipment lane can be scored and prioritized. The proposed TOPSIS-based FMEA approach in the intuitionistic fuzzy environment provides an opportunity to aggregate the risk assessments of different experts in a practically efficient way. Different from the earlier literature, we address risk identification and risk assessment under uncertainty as the two key challenges in group decision making. Our method further provides a framework that integrates the categorization and evaluation of risks with subsequent decision making. A case study of shipping lane selection in the context of air cargo distribution of pharmaceutical products demonstrates a potential implementation of the proposed approach.}

The integrated problem consists of two subproblems: An m-machine permutation flow shop with inventory considerations for the manufacturer and a routing problem for the 3PL provider. Both agents face tardiness penalty costs in case of late delivery to the customer locations. Assuming imperfect information sharing between the two agents and independence in their own decisions, we investigate the scenario in which the manufacturer dominates the negotiation. In this scenario, the manufacturer imposes the number and composition of vehicles as well as the vehicle departure dates on the 3PL provider. However, lacking the information regarding the actual delivery times he is forced to estimate delivery times at the customer locations in the context of his planning. Following the planning of the manufacturer, the 3PL provider decides on the optimal routing of the vehicles. Both agents aim to minimise their total costs. After formulating the problems as a mixed integer linear program, two metaheuristic algorithms are proposed to solve the scenario. The performance of the heuristics is evaluated on a set of randomly generated instances. The results show that the genetic algorithm is the best performing method.}

Despite the concerted efforts of the central and state governments and other immunization stakeholders, full immunization rates in India remains low. This paper outlines the findings of a comprehensive review of the Universal Immunization Programme (UIP) and provide recommendations to formulate an action plan for improving routine immunization coverage.
Design
A mixed-method approach was adopted to collect data under four thematic areas, namely programme implementation, vaccine logistics and cold chain, data recording and reporting system, and programme communication in five high priority states. Results obtained for indicators under each thematic area, were then divided into four categories: a) ≥90 % - good, b) 70–90%-fair, c) 50–70 % - average and d) < 50 % - poor.
Setting
The review was undertaken in five high-priority states – Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. Four districts were selected base on a scoring criterion from each state.
Results
The programme implementation was found average ranging from 53.6 % to 63.8 % and the mechanism of vaccine logistic and cold chain was fair ranging from 71.0 % to 79.4 % across all the states. The mechanism of data recording and reporting was poor in Madhya Pradesh (36.8 %) and Maharashtra (47.0 %) and average in the remaining three states. Programme communication needs considerable improvement. Except Madhya Pradesh (62.4 %), the communication activities were poor in the other four states.
Conclusion
The methodology of the review will help in identifying critical gaps and strengths in the immunization processes and in formulating an immunization coverage improvement plan (ICIP) in the states.}

However, relatively sparse research is available on aggregated movement or freight on national, state, or local transportation networks. Better understanding and modeling freight movement on highway networks to facilitate local transportation, land use, economic development, and comprehensive planning is at the heart of freight research. Therefore, the major endeavors and novel contributions of this research include a conceptual framework proposed for freight movement research, a multi-level spatial-temporal freight model based upon the social optimum assignment for optimal “from”, “to”, “within”, and “through” freight flows of manufactured goods on the U.S. highway networks, and a set of performance measures designed to reveal states in terms of their competitive advantages in production, attraction, self-sufficiency, or cross-road. The freight flows were first visualized and highlighted by state at the U.S. level, then by county at the state level for Oklahoma, and finally by traffic analysis zone for the Tulsa metropolitan area. The spatial split of freight flows was accomplished through using freight, network, and demographic-economic databases at state, county, and zone scales.}

Over time, the global manufacturing networks mature and the oversea plants increasingly overtake value-adding processes and integrate local suppliers. However, typically the supply chain management and design are not adapted to this maturing process and the supply chains are characterized by high inventories and long lead times.

Four themes emerged as IPE learning expectations and benefits: my own professional role, professional role of others, teamwork, and communication. The theme of interacting with peers surfaced as an additional IPE benefit. There were four themes noted as IPE barriers: course logistics, lack of context, course content, and social dynamics.
Conclusion
This multi-institutional qualitative study adds to the literature by providing empirical evidence regarding early learner perceptions of IPE experiences. Student expectations and benefits of their introductory IPE course/curriculum aligned. Perceived barriers are useful in informing future IPE implementation and research.}

abstract = {Express parcel carriers offer a wide range of guaranteed delivery times in order to separate customers who value quick delivery from those that are less time but more price sensitive. To reflect the additional complexity this segmentation adds to the task of optimizing the logistics operations, we present a new model that accounts for the interplay between pricing of due times, customer decisions and the associated restrictions in the distribution process. This profit-maximizing express shipment service network design problem is solved by a heuristic solution approach that simultaneously determines the ideal set of offered delivery times, the associated pricing scheme and the load plan in order to maximize profit. High-quality solutions for realistically-sized instances are derived by a genetic-algorithm-based heuristic that exploits information of previously evaluated iterations. Using this new integrated approach, we provide insight on the potential benefit of an integrated model over sequential optimization of revenue and delivery cost. We also investigate the impact of tighter delivery due times on resource requirements and whether more granular service segmentation can be considered a profitable strategy in multimodal express parcel delivery networks.}

Features of competition for this market are related to quality, logistics cost and performance, all of which are manifested in port-basis values and ocean shipping-cost differentials. It is commonly recognized that soybean quality in the United States' Upper Midwest is deficient relative to soybeans shipped via the Gulf. These regions also compete directly or indirectly with soybeans from the central and southern United States. This study's purpose is to analyze trading opportunities for soybeans which are marketed from the Upper Midwest. A stochastic optimization model was specified for the soybean supply chain in order to capture these phenomena. The model is of a trader and assess impacts of quality variability from different origins and quality requirements. Choices for the trader include testing throughout the system, blending and spatial origination decisions. Some important results include that quality variation is an important problem which affects purchasing and procurement decisions for U.S. soybeans. Shippers can mitigate these risks with testing and targeted logistical strategies, both of which lower the buyer's risk.}

A large area off the northern coast of Scotland is defined and separated into coordinate grids. The environmental, logistical and facilities factors are first analysed in order to remove sites that fall within restricted areas. Following this, data is gathered for the remaining sites in terms of a set of Logistics, Facilities & Environmental, and Met-Ocean criteria. The logistical criterion consists of such factors as, depth, distance to ports and distance to substations. The Met-ocean criterion provides a data analysis of the wind, wave, tidal and current conditions of each site between 2011 and 2016, and the Facilities & Environmental criterion analyses the proximity of the sites to such criteria as Marine Protection Areas, Special Areas of Conservation, military training areas and subsea facilities. The compiled data is then applied to a Multiple Attribute Decision Analysis (MADA) algorithm which aggregates the data for each site and produces a utility ranking in order to determine the most suitable site for floating offshore wind. Validation is conducted through benchmark testing and correlation with government survey sites.}

Among different tools and methodologies, the closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) model as an established approach has shown its efficiency in reflecting these relations regarding the consumers’ behavior. Because of the complexity, limited studies have considered the effects of different factors simultaneously on different CLSC network designs. This is the first attempt to study the effects of carbon emission and remanufacturing simultaneously on a dual-channel in both forward and reverse logistics, while there is competition on collection. Accordingly, a novel format for the demand function is suggested and employed. The decisions regarding the optimal pricing and collection strategies of CLSCs were investigated, within which the manufacturer is responsible for the remanufacturing process and selling the remanufactured products directly to the customer through the online channel. In contrast, new products are sold via the traditional retailer channel, imposing relevant costs. We explore the effect of different dual-collection settings when there is competition between collector parties under three possible options (i.e., Manufacturer-Retailer, Manufacturer-Third-party, and Retailer-Third-party). The considered demand for both new and remanufactured products addresses consumers who have different willingness to choose the remanufactured items and are sensitive to the produced products’ carbon footprint. The behavior of the formulated CLSC models is studied by game theory regarding decision variables, and each player's profit is discussed through systematic comparison. We analytically show that considering all the effects, third-party entry is not in the manufacturer's interest. The findings show that consumers’ willingness to choose remanufactured products is generally more influential on prices and profits than their sensitivity to the carbon footprint.}

Motivated by recent advances in collecting/recycling food wastes through recycling supply chains, this study contributes to optimize such a recycling channel in urban areas. We examine if renting waste-recycling facilities by a food trading company located in urban areas, where production/recycling processes are prohibited, is able to mitigate the problem. This paper examines a three-tier CLSC, including a trading company located in urban areas, a production plant located in peri-urban zones, and a food-waste-collector, in which food-waste is collected from restaurants/chain-stores for recycling purposes. The trading company rents waste-recycling facilities from the production plant in the peri-urban zones to carry out the relevant processes. To coordinate the channel, a novel Quantity Flexibility (QF) contract is developed. Results, based on a real case study in the meat products supply chain, show that profitability of the supply chain is increased using the proposed QF contract significantly (e.g., 30 percent increase in the food-waste-collector's expected profit). The findings from our developed models can help food supply chain managers to find cost-effective solutions for cooperating with other supply chain members. Our results show a Pareto-improvement outcome.}

Many other examples to illustrate the usefulness of gamma radiation applications could be mentioned, but space is limited for such additional coverage. The attentive and informed reader will notice that one major topic has been left out of this text. This topic is gamma-assisted non-destructive testing (NDT), or industrial radiography, performed with X-ray or gamma-ray sources to detect flaws and failures for instance in weldings, in concrete structures and similar. The reason is that several major texts and books already exist in the area. References to some relevant texts for this topic are given in refs. (NRC, 2008; Halmshaw, 2012; Jaques and Rehman, 2020). Hopefully, the reader will be left with the impression that gamma assisted methods are exceptionally useful for material testing, inspection and process examination and control. The non-destructive nature of low-doserate gamma radiation from longer-lived gamma sources makes such sources versatile and applicable for implementation in non-intrusive, continuous and on-line/on-site examinations. Small sizes simplify logistics and implementation. In many cases, gamma radiation technology cannot be substituted by any other technical methods. Still, radioactive sources should be handled by personnel qualified in radiation protection to ensure safe handling and implementation.}

Many countries show a growing willingness to use militaries in support of global health efforts. This Series paper summarises the varied roles, responsibilities, and approaches of militaries in global health, drawing on examples and case studies across peacetime, conflict, and disaster response environments. Militaries have many capabilities applicable to global health, ranging from research, surveillance, and medical expertise to rapidly deployable, large-scale assets for logistics, transportation, and security. Despite this large range of capabilities, militaries also have limitations when engaging in global health activities. Militaries focus on strategic, operational, and tactical objectives that support their security and defence missions, which can conflict with humanitarian and global health equity objectives. Guidelines—both within and outside militaries—for military engagement in global health are often lacking, as are structured opportunities for military and civilian organisations to engage one another. We summarise policies that can help close the gap between military and civilian actors to catalyse the contributions of all participants to enhance global health.}

Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) are expected to be applied in the near future. In this context, how to schedule CAVs to meet customer demands with carbon emissions minimization has become a new green vehicle routing problem (VRP). Due to the fact that carbon emissions are tremendously influenced by vehicle speed, this paper considers vehicle speed as a decision variable in the above low-carbon VRP for CAVs. In addition, the differentiation on speed limits in each time period and each type of road are also taken into account. This study formulates a nonlinear mixed-integer programming model for this problem. The outer-approximate method is used to linearize the proposed model. Moreover, a hybrid particle swarm optimization (HPSO) algorithm is developed to solve this problem. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed model and the efficiency of the proposed solution method. Some implications are also drawn out for reducing carbon emissions in logistics activities.}

The colocation of such interrelated companies in ports creates synergies, such as the shared use of infrastructure and services and the availability of specialized knowledge and skills. The port cluster concept has proven to be a useful “lens” for analyzing ports. With the cluster “lens” scholars address research issues that are complementary to the established lens of treating a port as a transport node. A port cluster consists of four components, transport-related activities, logistics and value-added activities, manufacturing activities, and leisure and tourism-related activities. A port cluster is in various ways different from the more widely studied “tech clusters.” This has important implications for the analysis of port clusters. First, port clusters are vulnerable to technological change. Second, the core challenge for port clusters lies in the absorptive capacity. R&D activities in port clusters are limited; the dominant innovation challenge is the (early) application of new knowledge (e.g., regarding digitalization, recycling technologies, bio-based chemicals, and smart grids). Third, contrary to most “tech clusters,” in which governance is rather loose, chaotic, and decentralized, structured governance mechanisms may be critical to enhancing the competitiveness of port clusters. A state-owned commercially run “port cluster developer” often plays a central role.}

It is anticipated that transforming the vaccine supply chain from syringe-and-needle to thermostable vaccines enabled by Micro Array Patch (MAP) will result in reduced supply chain costs as well as reduced wastes (environmental impact) and improved safety. This paper provides a thorough cost comparison of the conventional syringe-and-needle vaccine supply chain versus the MAP vaccine supply chain for influenza vaccine delivery in Australia.
Objective
To determine the potential cost implications and general benefits of replacing syringe-and-needle flu vaccine with MAP-enabled thermostable flu vaccine in Australia.
Methods
We first provide a snapshot of the existing flu vaccine supply chain in Australia including its limitations and opportunities for improvement. Data/information is collected through interviewing the key stakeholders across vaccine supply chain including vaccine manufacturers, logistics providers, clinics, hospitals, and pharmacies. A cost/benefit analysis of the anticipated supply chain of the MAP-enabled vaccine will reveal the opportunities and challenges of supply chain transformation for flu vaccine delivery in Australia.
Findings
Our high-level practice-informed cost/benefit analysis identifies cold chain removal as an important source of cost saving, but administrative cost savings appear to be even more significant (e.g., time saving for nurses and those involved in cold chain management). Our analysis also identifies the key benefits and limitations of vaccine supply chain transformation in Australia.
Conclusion
We conclude that the benefits of moving from syringe-and-needle vaccines to thermostable MAP-delivered vaccines are beyond transportation and storage cost saving. Potential benefits through cost saving, waste reduction, and service level improvement are discussed along with various safety and wellbeing consequences as well as directions for future research in this area.}

The network status is constantly changing, and the acquisition and analysis of the real-time status of each link on the transaction path can further improve the accuracy of the optimal path selection. Meanwhile, traditional networks can no longer adapt to the rapid development of today’s network technology and applications due to their rigid structure and simplified functions. As for traditional networks and their associated network equipment, problems such as inconvenient management and monitoring, poor interoperability, difficulty in expanding network functions, and high operating costs have severely hindered the efficiency of network functions and the pace of innovation. In order to solve many problems faced by traditional networks, in the paper, an SDN network path selection algorithm based on the dual impact factors of cloud service nodes is proposed. In the algorithm proposed in the paper, the final selected path is considered to be composed of multiple links. First, a cloud environment based on the Ryu controller is build, and a corresponding data collection strategy is constructed to complete the acquisition of the link available bandwidth and delay that affect the real-time status of the path. Then, the weighted results are calculated according to the proposed candidate path weight distribution formula to realize the sorting and screening of each transaction link, and provide support for the selection of the cross-border transaction system service path with load balance. The simulation results show that compared with the traditional DLB algorithm, the algorithm proposed in the paper has better load balancing performance, which further shows that the proposed algorithm has a better choice for the path.}

The effectiveness of corporate social responsibility (CSR) is evaluated based on the implementation of the social sustainability practices in the warehousing organizations of the developing countries. Taking a survey-based approach data collected from 217 organizations is statistically analysed using binary logistic regression. The hybrid approach results indicate the importance of ‘responsible work environment’ as strong contender for reflecting effectiveness of corporate social responsibility. Contrary to theoretical predictions and expectations, ‘training education and development’ is found lacking for improving social footprints of organizations indicating deeper and rigorous approaches. Additionally, social sustainability practices ‘corporate ethical responsibility commitment’ towards social reforms and ‘Philanthropy’ are considerably lacking the seriousness of corporates and require further exploring.}

Resilient pharmaceutical systems and supply chains are critical in the control of COVID-19, a pandemic that has mostly devastated public health systems and livelihoods in resource-limited countries in sub-Saharan Africa.
Objective
To evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on pharmaceutical systems and supply chain in a resource-limited setting.
Methods
A descriptive qualitative survey using a phenomenological approach was conducted among key informants in the public and private pharmaceutical sectors of Namibia. Data were collected on the perceived impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the supply chain, as well as access and availability of essential medicines among the distributors and points of care in the private and public sectors. Qualitative themes of the impact were analyzed using Tesch's approach.
Results
Of the 21 key-informants, 57.1% were female and 85% were from the private versus the public pharmaceutical sector. Overall, key informants reported a negative impact on access and availability of essential medicines, particularly sanitation and hygiene products, and antimicrobials. Most medicine outlets, experienced longer lead times, attributed to reduced inter-country transportation of goods and services and limited in-country capacity and capabilities to manufacture. The main thematic challenges included bureaucratic bottlenecks and lack of emergency readiness of the medicine's logistics supply chain in Namibia.
Conclusion
COVID-19 pandemic aggravated the inequitable access to essential medicines in the public and private sectors of Namibia. Governments in resource-limited countries need to strengthen in-country Private-Public Partnerships as well as regional treaties for Universal Health Coverage in context of the COVID-19 pandemic.}

On the other hand, sustainability reporting is a vital tool for identifying companies' potential social and environmental impacts. It is also a critical factor that can help reduce risk and increase small businesses' competitiveness, facilitating their access to global value chains. However, the vast majority of research to date has focused on sustainability reporting by large multinational companies. In this context, this article's objectives are to broaden the debate on sustainable supply chain management and gain insight into the relationship between sustainability and competitiveness in companies. A qualitative approach is used through a case study method to investigate the Corporate Sustainability and Reporting for Competitive Business program in Peru. A sample of 72 SMEs from more than 20 sectors was analysed. The results show that the social dimension was the most reported with 52%, followed by environmental with 27% and economical with 21%. The sectors reporting the most are energy, textile, and logistics. The study also indicates that 78% of SMEs fully or partially met sustainability reporting requirements stipulated by lead companies. The program also enabled the companies to improve their strategic vision, strengthen the relationship with their respective leading companies, generate greater competitiveness, and access new markets. The main conclusions indicate academic and practical implications that will reduce the impact of operations and production on the supply chain and contribute to sustainable development.

This study was conducted with a qualitative descriptive design including in-depth semi-structured interviews according to COREQ-criteria. Participants included clinicians and patients. Grounded theory analysis was used to describe the main themes.
Results
A total of 9 clinicians and 4 patients participated. Four major themes (1) opinions about shared decision making (SDM), (2) current practice, (3) experience with the DA, (4) suggestions for improvement and one minor theme (5) experience with the study, emerged. Clinicians were predominantly positive about the DA.
Conclusion
Despite the positive attitudes of the clinicians in this study, the implementation of a DA is still challenging. The DA is forgotten regularly as improvement of logistics is needed, clinicians assume they already provide good care which might result in a reluctance to change and more engagement of physicians is needed.
Practice Implications
Regular contact with clinicians to remind, help and increase engagement and a decrease of the logistic burden is needed to ensure all patients can fully benefit of the DA.}

abstract = {Gantry crane is a widely used equipment in logistics fields. Stress fatigue crack propagation is an important fatigue mode of gantry crane in services. Based on theoretical analysis and acoustic emission (AE) test, A new crack propagation analysis method was proposed in this investigation. A two-parameter basis function was adopted to analyze crack propagation of steel Q235B, and the response surface was modeled to predict the fatigue life of steel specimen, moreover AE technique was advanced to detect the crack propagation, where layout of AE sensors was optimized to achieve a precise result. Consequently the proposed method was applied in practical box-girder crack propagation analysis. By comparison with theoretical analysis, it indicated that this method was precise and could be applied in practical engineering.}
