abstract = {Automated guided vehicles (AGVs) with autonomous behavior and decentralized human–machine interaction (HMI) are suitable for use in logistics. To facilitate natural interaction, HMI may involve both speech and gesture control. This paper presents a new cognitive approach based on electroencephalography (EEG) for multimodal HMI combining speech and gesture control for AGVs used in logistics. The results indicate that implicit EEG-based measures such as alertness and relaxation significantly affect speech control performance. Consequently, monitoring the user's cognitive workload during logistic operations may lead to a substantial improvement in work performance.}

Yet, the studies also show that despite widespread knowledge of best practices, most institutions struggle to deploy practices that can enhance the logistics performance of their organization. In fact, healthcare institution managers are lacking guidelines enabling them to deploy a logistics strategy supporting the implementation of such practices. Using longitudinal case studies of two Canadian hospitals that made significant improvements in this regard, we will analyze the deployment strategy for exemplary materials management practices. In these studies, we will consider that two aspects are essential in deploying a logistics strategy in a service undertaking. First, there must be well-defined strategic intent. Based on this, the organization must implement an experimental series of logistics practices. This implementation process offers two benefits: 1) it should enable innovative practices to be tested, and 2) it should provide the organization with the time to absorb these innovations, particularly given the complex environment within a hospital.}

This paper focuses on logistic determinants in a MWMS, taking into account existing legal requirements, organizational factors and economic aspects (on the example of Poland). Problems associated with effective logistics are essential for the quality and safety of a MWMS and these issues seem to be still undervalued. In Poland, there is approximately 40 thousand waste generators and each year they produce on average 45 thousand tons of medical waste, of which more than 90% is classified as infectious. The biggest flow comes from hospitals and large health care units; other sources are private medical practices, research units, hospices and pharmacies. All units generating medical waste must comply with strict requirements for the collection, storage and disposal, particularly with regard to infectious waste. In view of the above, organizational structure should include goals and constraints of MWMS in order to implement them in real-world conditions The framework for sustainable operation of a MWMS is efficient logistics of waste and balance in the link between waste generation units and treatment facilities.}

Sertu cleansing operations is to ensure transportation and logistics carrying halal products are assured with no occurrence of contamination from non-halal. The awareness on the sertu cleansing operations in Malaysia among industry players is relatively low. Therefore, this study explores the literary review on sertu cleansing operations and procedural requirements, as stated in the Malaysian Standards MS2400:2010 for halalan-toyyiban assurance pipeline, or known as the halal supply chain management. Halal cleansing operations is significant for halal integrity implementation in the halal logistics’ equipment not only through compliance of this MS2400 requirements but what is more important to carry out with in-depth understanding and observance of the Shariah requirements. In summary, the knowledge and literature on sertu cleansing operations can be used as a reference for the halal authority, halal logistics service providers and researchers in halal logistics and supply chain management}

However, some groups including local neighbors and businesses are raising complaints as they are being affected by these measures. This is also the case for couriers and logistics companies which have now to comply with new regulations regarding delivery routes throughout the Old Town. This paper will present a comprehensive study of the situation that is being carried out, and in which social perceptions and freight traffic patterns in the Old Town of Pamplona are analyzed to understand how urban freight distribution could be improved in the area. For this purpose, we make use of a survey-based research to the stakeholders, i.e. pedestrians, logistics companies, retailers, and authorities of Pamplona. Results highlight pollution derived from transportation, lack of parking spaces as well as invasion of public spaces in the city center as the key issues for improving freight transportation in the Old Town. Finally, placing a distribution center in the Old Town and the promotion of the cycle-logistics are considered as the future of the urban distribution in Pamplona.}

This study uses Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and robust regression approach in secondary data from the annual study published by Revista Tecnologística (years 2008–2016). The aim is to measure the impact of contextual variables on the efficiency of Brazilian 3PL providers of refrigeration services. Results indicate that, in fact, pure, technical and scale efficiency levels are differently impacted by the type of technology adopted and the services offered, what leaves room opened for the adoption of different measures and operational practices to increase efficiency levels in its different dimensions. The study provides guidance for managers who wish to establish or adapt specialized 3PL structures and management systems in cold chains. Our study is the first to help identifying the main determinants of efficiency for 3PL providers of refrigeration services in an emerging economy.

RL is increasingly gaining recognition as an essential component in the design process of supply chains. In this paper, we formulate a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model that aims to determine the optimal locations and capacities of various nodes such as inspection centers and remanufacturing facilities and to help decision makers find optimal transportation decisions and to determine the number and type of transportation units required in the network. We develop an exact method to solve large-scale real-sized instances of this problem. We initially attempt to solve the problem using the traditional Benders Decomposition (BD) technique which fails to solve the problem in reasonable computational times. We improve the traditional BD technique by adding several accelerating methods such as trust-region, logistics constraints, Pareto-optimal cuts, restructuring of the problem, and continuous relaxation of the integer variables to increase the convergence rate and to reduce the total number of cuts required in the master problem. In almost all the instances, we were able to reach optimal solutions. For the remaining instances, we succeed in solving the largest problem with an optimality gap of 0.5% and within a reasonable running time. The paper highlights and evaluates the performance and effectiveness of the different acceleration techniques of our improved BD algorithm along with the computational results.}

Pharmaceutical companies are undergoing major changes to cope with the new challenges of the modern economy. Indeed, the pharmaceutical industry faces relentless change and fluctuating demand which creates immense challenges in anticipating best sellers and predicting volume. The shortening of patent life periods, generic competition and public health policies, among other factors, have changed the operating context of the pharmaceutical industry. To focus on their core competencies, more organizations are investigating the feasibility of outsourcing logistics to improve the performance of their supply chain. In order to cope with various risks and uncertainty in the pharmaceutical supply chain, this study aims to propose an innovative approach for risk assessment in order to measure the level of risks related to outsourcing logistics. The paper highlights the risks faced in this context and also identifies the critical points in each section of the supply. Fuzzy AHP and PROMETHEE are combined to evaluate risks and assign them to predefined categories. The quality and efficiency of the proposed method are confirmed through an application to the supply chain of pharmaceuticals.}

Based on the characteristics of the waste wood, it can be classified in four (4) categories: A I, A II, A III and A IV. This paper focuses in the A I waste wood since is the only category able to be used directly for both material and energy purposes without a previously pre-treatment. Currently, most of this waste wood is used for direct energy production due to the previous government legislation that promoted its use directly in incineration facilities. However, the newest Renewable Energy Act (EEG 2017) may promote the cascade-use of A I waste wood prior to be intended for energy purposes. Nonetheless, the government incentives to the energy sector is not the only bottleneck that the use of A I waste wood as raw material in the wood-based industry has to overcome. The peak availability, collection logistics (collection centers and transportation) and recycling facility location are some of the parameters that must be considered in order to design the “best” supply chain network for A I waste wood. This work presents a detailed description of the effect of the hierarchical strategic decision in the proper design of the waste wood supply chain. Additionally, the global picture of waste wood recycling in different European countries (UK, Italy and Finland) is briefly presented.}

However, many countries face challenges guaranteeing sufficient amounts of biomass through reliable domestic biomass supply chains and resort to international supply chains. Within this frame, novel pre-treatment technologies, particularly pelletization and torrefaction, emerged in recent years to facilitate logistics by improving the durability and the energy density of solid biomass. This paper aims to evaluate these pre-treatment technologies from a techno-economic and environmental point of view for two reference coal power plants located in Great Britain and in Italy. Logistics costs and carbon emissions are modelled for both international and domestic biomass supply chains. The impact of pre-treatment technologies on carbon emission avoidance costs is evaluated. It is demonstrated that, for both cases, pre-treatment technologies are hardly viable for domestic supply. However, pre-treatment technologies are found to render most international bioenergy supply chains competitive with domestic ones, especially if sourcing areas are located in low labour cost countries. In many cases, pre-treatment technologies are found to guarantee similar CO2 equivalent emissions performance for international compared to domestic supply chains.}

A mathematical model is presented in this paper, combining locational decisions with the max-flow problem in order to select safe destinations which maximize the number of dispatched people. The existing frameworks for emergency logistics usually model the evacuation process based on fixed and pre-determined destinations with a strategic perspective. The unpredictable and turbulent nature of a disaster may; however, disrupt the predictions. Furthermore, the primary goal in emergency situations is to dispatch people from the danger zone to a safe place, no matter where. A mixed integer linear programming model is developed in this paper for selecting one or more destinations in a capacitated network. The special structure of the model and its similarity to the max-flow problem allow us to develop exact algorithms and heuristics both for the multiple and single destination location problem. The solution methods are based on existing algorithms for the max-flow problem. Our proposed heuristics use the idea of adding a super-sink to the network to generate upper bounds very fast. The exact algorithms as well as the heuristics are tested on randomly generated instances as well as a real world network. The most important statistics of their computation times are reported. They are also compared according to their performance (gap to optimality) and their behavior amongst different categories of the graphs. Finally we have presented a real-case addressing the problem of choosing a number of destination locations from a fixed set of pilot pre-determined locations. The problem of deciding on the destinations is considered under 5 grades of disaster severity and the related impacts on choosing the safe zones are analyzed.}

In this article, a model for the discrete choice of shipment sizes is applied to interregional road freight transport. Preferences of actors are reflected by a total logistics cost expression. Furthermore, a Latent Class Analysis approach is applied to identify groups of transport cases with similar logistics requirements. The classification reduces significantly heterogeneity in behavior.

abstract = {In recent years, with the enlarging scale of the Chinese retail industry and the rapid growth of retail turnover, the energy consumption and relevant carbon emissions of the Chinese retail industry have seen a gradual upward tendency. Therefore, how to effectively reduce its carbon emissions has become increasingly important. Carbon emissions in the process of logistics distribution account for nearly 60% of the total carbon emissions in the Chinese retail industry, so the improved efficiency in logistics transportation can not only save operational costs but also significantly reduce carbon emissions of the Chinese retail industry. This paper aims to research on the optimization of vehicle routes of logistics distribution with their distribution centers and distribution vehicles. First, Model Z1 is built to describe logistics carbon emissions relative to the shortest optimal route, which is used to simulate the distribution distances of different routes. Compared with Model Z1, Model Z2 which describes the optimal vehicle routes relative to carbon emission reduction is established with the objective constraint function of carbon emission included. It is used to simulate carbon emissions of different routes. The two models are then compared and their differences in route and distribution order are obtained. Based on the actual data of the distribution center and the chain stores responsible for distribution of a chain retail company in south China, the annealing simulation method is employed in the computations of Models Z1 and Z2 and results of the optimal routes are obtained with the software Matlab. The results show that the distribution distance is a critical factor in influencing carbon emissions. The shortest vehicle route significantly affects the volume of carbon emission. Optimizing the distribution order further reduces carbon emissions after a constraint function of carbon emission is presented.}

Nevertheless, it is far from obvious that UCC are efficient and viable. The aim of this study is to provide answers to two questions: can an UCC be viable? Does the shape of a city affect the profitability of an UCC? We present a preliminary work based on a comparison between three morphologies to give some clues.}

This paper addresses the problem of designing a set of vehicle routes satisfying the delivery and the collection requirements of a set of geographically scattered linehaul and backhaul customers. Each customer has a known demand for delivery and/or pickup, and it must be serviced within a predefined time window, representing the earliest and the latest times service time, by a vehicle of a heterogeneous fleet of depot-returning capacitated vehicles. Additionally the proposed model, aiming at minimizing the logistics costs, also takes manufacturing capacities and driving hour's regulations into consideration. The proposed algorithm was embedded in a native application. This digital tool, enabling the support of a holistic production and logistics planning, was implemented in a food company.}

It was discovered that the majority of the stakeholders agree that the reverse logistics credit market is a possibility, but currently there are multiple obstacles to its implementation. Regarding the comparison of RLC with the carbon credit market, there are still many aspects to be developed before the RLC market becomes a reality. The Brazilian RLC market still does not have any legal support to work on, no organization to control and audit the market, and no support from the government.}

According to this point of view, a great attention is addressed to the biodiesel production as substitute of diesel derived by fossil hydrocarbons. The use of biomasses from different sources for the energy production constitutes one of the main objects thanks to which European Community intends to reduce its dependence from oil importations and derived products over the medium to longer term. Several sources can be used for biodiesel production, among these Brassica carinata and Brassica napus are considered as possible dedicated energy crops. The present work is based on the implementation of a model that allows to analyze the insertion of agro-energetic farms, identifying and evaluating the crops previously mentioned, economically suitable to enter in rotation with cereals and legumes. Through the analysis of official statistical data and cereals and legumes production, an estimation of potential biodiesel production in relation with the considered territory chosen as case study. It was implemented a model based on a procedure of logistics and distribution management in Matlab and in a Gis environment in order to find the best location for a potential production plant. The model considered some collection points of crops according the administrative units of the territory of reference. Moreover, for the same territory, thanks to some simulations it was calculated how the potential biodiesel production could affect fuels consumption and the potential reduction of the amount of CO2 in the environment.}

All the same, researchers have rarely described business model components relevant to city logistics. In response, the purpose of this article is to analyse critical factors for viable business models of city logistics initiatives involving UCCs. Following an extensive literature review and multiple-case study of five initiatives with UCCs, we identified seven critical factors of viable city logistics business models: the ability to scale up and down the UCC solution; an ability to continuously develop and adapt to a dynamic environment; the important entrepreneurial role of the initiator as well; the acknowledgment of society; ability to innovate new services; logistics and supply chain management competence; and the ability to take full advantage of advanced IT. All seven factors describe continuously redeveloped business models seeking to seize new and unexpected opportunities, yet also indicate that city logistics systems require local authorities and municipalities to act as initiators, enablers, and customers. The models also underscore differences between purely commercial and purely municipal city logistics initiatives.}

Moreover, due the consequences of global warming, these areas could be subject to risk events with increased probability with respect to the past. Information technologies enable an innovative approach towards safety management, which relies on the evolution of tools for environmental monitoring and citizens’ interaction. This work presents the preliminary results of the Italian research project SIGMA - sensor Integrated System in cloud environment for the Advanced Multi-risk Management. The proposed system includes a continuous monitoring of the different information sources, thus reducing human control as much as possible. At the same time, the communication system manages multiple data flows in a flexible way, adapting itself to different working scenarios, enabling smarter applications. SIGMA intends to acquire, integrate and compute heterogeneous data, coming from various sensor networks in order to provide useful insights for the monitoring, forecasting and management of risk situations through services provided to citizens and businesses, both public and private. Based on the integration of different interoperating components, the system is able to provide a complete emergency management framework through simulations/optimizations and heterogeneous data manipulation tools. The prototype solution is detailed by a use case application in an industrial area located in the region of Sicily, Italy. In particular, web based modular applications connected through SIGMA allow the monitoring of the industrial environment through data gathering from different sensor networks, such as outdoor sensors mounted in the surroundings of large industrial areas, and support of the design of the logistics network aimed at covering the industrial risks.}

This research presents the group of green vehicle routing problems with environmental costs translated into money versus production of noise, pollution and fuel consumption. This research is focused on multi-objective green logistics optimization. Optimality criteria are environmental costs: minimization of amount of money paid as externality cost for noise, pollution and costs of fuel versus minimization of noise, pollution and fuel consumption themselves. Some mixed integer programming formulations of multi-criteria vehicle routing problems have been considered. Mathematical models were formulated under assumption of existence of asymmetric distance-based costs and use of homogeneous fleet. The exact solution methods are applied for finding optimal solutions. The software used to solve these models is the CPLEX solver with AMPL programming language. The researchers were able to use real data from a Spanish company of groceries. Problems deal with green logistics for routes crossing the Spanish regions of Navarre, Basque Country and La Rioja. Analyses of obtained results could help logistics managers to lead the initiative in area of green logistics by saving money paid for environmental costs as well as direct cost of fuel and minimization of pollution and noise.}

We scrutinize a random sample of 305 Polish logistics services firms in order to capture the managers' perception of direct and indirect relationships. We have identified a network myopia phenomenon, that is a narrow view of relevant actors and relationships in the firm's network environment. Our data suggest that managers rate vertical relationships along the supply chain much higher as compared to the value network, and direct relationships much higher as compared to indirect ones. We find support for the concern expressed in previous studies that managers may be narrowing the number and diversity of relevant actors to manageable levels, making their extended network largely invisible. We substantiate the gap arising from the managers' network perception insofar as exploiting the potential of network strategies is concerned. This may undermine the capability to see prospective partners, the benefits of establishing diverse relationships, and the opportunities embedded in networks. This study extends earlier research on network pictures by better understanding the views of network surroundings by involved actors.}

To solve the problems posed by nonlinear characteristics and uncertainty in the number of end-of-life vehicles recycled, and deal with the multiple factors influencing the recycling number, this paper presents a combined prediction model consisting of a grey model, exponential smoothing and an artificial neural network optimized by the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Using Shanghai's end-of-life vehicle reverse logistics industry as an example, this study selects historical data about end-of-life vehicles recycled in Shanghai during the 2005–2016 period, identifies multiple influential factors, and validates the effectiveness and feasibility of the prediction model through empirical research.

The main objective of this work was to analyze logistic flows by paying special attention to the detailed description of traffic that depends on the urban outline in order to analyze the logistic flows of goods, and to discuss different policies to improve urban goods logistics without forgetting that routes exist and form part of a the development of a more humane city, where delivery vehicles enter pedestrian zones.

Especially urban settings suffer from congestion and air pollution. Shifting deliveries to the night is considered as one promising solution to alleviate the growing congestion and emissions generated by freight transport. In order to check the compatibility of night deliveries with its local environment, research has been mostly focused on the analysis of trials and on the impacts it has at a micro level. This paper aims at analysing the impact of night distribution at a macro level. It evaluates the contribution of off hour deliveries on the performances of the transport system. The paper will use TRABAM, a freight transport agent based model, to simulate the impact of different use of night distribution in supermarkets. The organisation of the freight flows resulting from the new time constraints is then evaluated according the externalities generated by these flows. The analysis shows that a distribution where deliveries are possible only during the day performs the worst since it generates the highest external costs. The business as usual gives already some good performances since night distribution is already used by some supermarkets in Wallonia. But the scenario where a maximum of one delivery per night is allowed to supermarkets is found to be the best trade-off between the benefits and drawbacks of night distribution.}

Within this context, a growing body of research is studying the socio-economic profile of the online shopper and the spatial variation in the demand for B2C goods. Yet, as can be expected for a relatively new evolution, little consensus exist. Therefore, in this paper, with data from the national retail federation on online shopping behaviour, we add to this growing field by first analysing the relation between socio-economic characteristics and the willingness to shop online. By mapping these characteristics, we then construct the geography of online shopping adoption in Belgium. Finally, we assess the impacts of this specific geography for the stakeholders that are adapting to this new reality. We conclude firstly that the well-educated man in his thirties with a well-paid job has the highest probability to shop online, independent of the level of urbanisation of the area he resides. Secondly, we predict over- and underestimations of the potential online buyers of up to 50% when assuming a homogeneous e-commerce penetration, especially in poorer urban areas. This implies a serious negligence for e-commerce practitioners and academics when ignoring the specific geography of the online shopping adoption.}

The degree of dissociation between adopted systems to evaluate solutions is analyzed for various participants through the whole supply chain. As a result, a conflict of interests is found between businessmen owning goods, transport companies, consumers, and the society. The basic requirements to logistics in the form of three goals (faster, cheaper, better) develop behavioral models and patterns to take decisions leading to unsafe situations on roads and violations of various requirements to transportation. Following interests of businessmen assessing efficiency using criteria of ROA (return on assets) and the value for business owners results in similar decisions. The paper describes a model of developing ROA elements that are affected by criteria for making decisions during goods transportation and decisions provoking violation of various rules and requirements. This model can provide a basis for a quantitative analysis of the factors’ impact on logistics costs and on the value of assets. Model development options depend on the selected method of economic analysis. This model allows revealing primary causes for road accidents, based on reaching the goals to be met through decisions in logistics and goals underlying business efficiency. The approach can also be used in determining trends in motivation of transport operators in observing the requirements and improving transport laws.}

Financial knowledge helps people feel more committed and involved in an organization. In our opinion, a manager does better when he understands how financial success is measured and how he has an impact on the company's performance. In this case we speak about a manager's financial literacy. The results of this paper reveal the effect of personal qualities of undergraduate students on the efficiency of acquisition of financial subjects. Sixty four participants between the age of 18 and 23 were recruited for this study from the programs Transport and Business Logistics and Business Management in Transportation of the Transport and Telecommunication Institute. The attainment of financial literacy amongst this student population was studied through the study of learning outcomes for financial subjects and the role of achievement motivation, its components and intellectual capabilities of these learner managers, future managers of transportation and logistics companies. To obtain the answer to the question of whether there is any correlation between achievement motivation and acquisition of financial literacy, the Achievement Motivation Inventory (AMI) of 17 facets and Raven's Progressive Matrices (SPM-C) were deployed, and the learning outcomes for financial subjects were analysed. The results of this paper indicate that striving for attainment is one of the main motivational factors for the achievement of financial literacy and development of financial management skills.}

abstract = {Development partners and donors have encouraged and incentivized governments in developing countries to explore ways of working with third-party service suppliers to reduce costs and increase service delivery capacity. The distribution of vaccines and medicines has for a long time shown demand for outsourcing but public health systems have struggled to develop the expertise and capital assets necessary to manage such ventures. Existing transport and logistics capacity within public health systems, in particular, is well documented as being insufficient to support existing, let alone future immunization needs. Today, a number of countries are contracting party logistics providers (3PLs) to supplement the in-house distribution operations of public health systems. This commentary reflects on recent, leading examples of outsourcing initiatives to address critical gaps in transport and logistics.}

Urbanisation is increasing at a rapid pace and one of the consequences of this trend is that more people live in cities, more people demand more products, and above all, more food needs to be transported to and distributed within the cities. With the advancement of new technologies and widespread use of mobile devices in the population, more and more people prefer to shop online, not just books, electronics, or fashion products, but food products as well, in particular the groceries. In this work, we focus on this growing challenge of food distribution in the cities, from the viewpoint of this emerging channel: home deliveries of online food purchases. Especially in the UK which is the second biggest online grocery market over the world, retailers are offering online shopping to their customers and then fulfil the home delivery using their own fleet. This poses challenges to retailers in terms of increased costs from providing a non-core service of distribution and logistics to end-consumers and the life in the cities in general in terms of increased carbon emissions and traffic. We design models that propose appropriate incentives to retailers to collaborate for the distribution of home deliveries. For this purpose, we initially investigate the current market structure and operations. Then, we test our logistics sharing models with empirical data from a retailer based in London to show the relevance of collaboration. Our results suggest that it is theoretically possible to collaborate and reduce economic, environmental, and social costs arising from the uncoordinated case; however, implementation of these ideas still pose a great challenge due to the extremely competitive nature of the food retail market.}

This paper attempts to use a study based on a survey of commuters in order to devise ways of encouraging the use of public transportation. Two different public transport policies were examined: (i) once-an-hour direct bus service from home to university (policy 1), and (ii) park-and-ride facilities (policy 2). Binary logistics models are proposed with the intention of comparing the utility of travel modes between private cars and public buses. These models are also used to identify the factors which have the potential to encourage car users to switch from travelling by cars to public buses. Explanatory factors considered in all three models include: occupation, trip length, travel time, trip frequency, gender, age and possession of a license. We began from the basic scenario by focusing on existing services without considering any new policy. The consequences of two new policies were then analysed in order to identify those factors which influence the choice of travel mode and which can predict the probability of behavioural change. All the proposed logistics models are evaluated using real-world data (with 4410 samples) from a survey carried out at the University of Wollongong (UOW), Australia. Stated preference (SP) questionnaires were used to collect relevant information on the choice of travel mode. Based on the proposed models, findings identify a hierarchy of importance of relevant factors which could assist decision makers to design and implement more successful future transport service(s).}

While many ports have moved out of city locations, partly facilitated by intermodal corridors, some ports remain in city locations, many retaining a large share of distribution activity in or near the port. This paper will consider distribution challenges arising from the port-city dynamic in relation to the port-inland distribution axis, in particular the role of port and city planners and decision makers in managing this process. The case analysis is based on the Port of Gothenburg, the largest port in Scandinavia. Findings suggest that the majority of influencing factors are marginally in favour of siting distribution facilities inland rather than near the port, yet city planning and national sentiment continue to incentivise development near the port. There are two conclusions for the port-centric city. First, it needs to coordinate its logistics from a regional perspective, determine what activities belong near the port and not compete with inland locations for what is better located there. Second, port-centric logistics needs to be better aligned with an urban freight transport and city logistics perspective.}

Supply vessels deliver all the necessary materials and equipment to offshore installations from an onshore supply base according to a delivery schedule. The planning of supply vessels should be done so that their number is minimized and at the same time provide a reliable flow of supplies from the base. The execution of a weekly sailing plan is affected by weather conditions, especially in winter time. Harsh weather conditions increase the number of vessels required to perform the operations as well as the service times at the installations, and thus disrupt the schedule, leading to additional costs and reduced service level. We present a methodology for robust supply vessel planning enabling a trade-off analysis to be made between the schedules’ service level and vessels’ cost. The methodology involves the generation of multiple vessel schedules with different level of robustness using an adaptive large neighbourhood search metaheuristic and a subsequent discrete event simulation procedure for the assessment of the service level. To control the level of robustness we developed a concept of slacks and incorporated it into the metaheuristic algorithm.}

Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) comparing the likelihood that individuals who ingested therapeutic doses of APAP and light-moderate amount of alcohol, compared to those who did not, would have kidney dysfunction were generated from multiple logistics regression models by further controlling for potential predisposing factors namely hypertension, diabetes and obesity. Kidney dysfunction was defined based on self-reports and laboratory examination of serum creatinine (SCr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and albumin creatinine ratio (ABCR). Statistically significant increased odds of renal dysfunction were noted among respondents who reported use of therapeutic doses of APAP and light-moderate amount of alcohol [OR(95% CI) = 1.64(1.28–2.10) self-report, 2.18(1.81–2.63) SCr, 4.60(3.03–7.00) BUN, 3.14(2.42–4.07) GFR, and 1.71(1.36–2.14) ALBCR)] even after adjusting for hypertension, diabetes and obesity [Adjusted OR (95% CI) = 1.78 (1.22–2.58) self-report, 2.05 (1.07–3.92) GFR]. The toxic effects of APAP and alcohol on the kidney were hypothesized. The threshold doses at which these effects begin to occur are unknown. The findings of this study suggest that even therapeutic doses of APAP and light-moderate amount of alcohol could be health problematic if consumed concomitantly.}

Even though the value of one organization's stock deployment is contingent on others' decisions, decision makers lack evidence regarding sector capacity to assess the marginal contribution (positive or negative) of their action. To our knowledge, there exist no metrics describing the system capacity across many agents to respond to disasters. To address this gap, our analytical approach yields new humanitarian logistics metrics based on stochastic optimization models. Our study incorporates empirical data on inventory stored by various organizations in United Nations facilities and in their own warehouses to offer practical insights regarding the current humanitarian response capabilities and strategies. By repositioning inventory already deployed, the system could respond to disasters in the same expected time with a range of 7.4%–20.0% lower cost for the items in our sample.}

abstract = {The fields of behavioural transport modelling has been gaining momentum and many researchers have focused on incorporating some elements of stakeholder behaviour and decision making into their freight planning tools. However, investigation of the literature reveals that few papers are devoted to understanding and integrating logistics behaviour of freight receivers into urban transport simulations, and the impact of receiver reordering constraints on other freight agents in the urban transportation network has not been thoroughly investigated. This paper is therefore concerned with evaluating the impacts that constraints set by freight receivers during reordering have on carriers’ behaviour and cost in an urban freight transport simulation. To achieve this, three key receiver reordering constraints scenarios are simulated: delivery time window durations; delivery frequencies and its associated quantities; and delivery unloading or service time at receiver facilities. These scenarios are then implemented in an agent-based transport simulation and the carrier’s behaviour and delivery cost are evaluated. Results indicate that narrowing time windows could result in delivery and penalty cost increases of up to 93%. Extending unloading times can see costs and penalties increase by up to 111%. Delivery frequency (and therefore order quantity) also has a major impact of the carrier’s cost, with cost increases of up to 142% when requesting more frequent deliveries of smaller quantities. These results confirm that carrier decisions are influenced significantly by changes in receiver reordering behaviour and unnecessary constraints imposed by receivers during reordering could have significant negative implications on the delivery cost of the carrier. This emphasises the importance of finding a balance between restrictions set by supply chain customers during reordering and the cost associated with those restrictions and highlights the importance of finding ways to urge freight agents, especially receivers, to change their current behaviour to lower the total delivery cost of the supply chain.}

Shipment orders arrive according to a compound Poisson process for each class. Upon an arrival, the logistics provider may continue consolidating arriving orders by paying a holding cost. Alternatively, the provider may dispatch, at a fixed cost, a vehicle containing (a portion of) the load consolidated so far. In addition, the provider must specify the composition of each dispatch by allocating (rationing) the volume of the vehicle between expedited and regular shipment orders. We model this problem as a continuous-time Markov Decision Process and minimize the expected discounted total cost. We prove the existence of quantity-based optimal threshold policies under particular conditions. We also structurally analyze the thresholds of these optimal policies. Based on these structural properties, we develop an efficient solution approach for large problem instances which are difficult to solve using the conventional policy-iteration method. For two real-life applications, we show that the quantity-based threshold policies derived using the proposed approach outperform the time policies used in practice.}

This study develops a model for integrating services among more than two courier companies for the same service area by proposing a way to design and assign routes for luggage delivery to each participating company. We verify the results of the proposed integration and cooperative operation model by comparing performance indicators (including total cost) between two routing approaches, the dynamic and fixed models, based on the demand pattern.

Many of these systems observe variability in the customer arrival rate. Therefore, solution methods, which are developed for SOQNs with time-homogeneous arrival rate, are insufficient to evaluate the performance of systems which observe time-varying arrivals. This paper presents an efficient solution approach for SOQNs with time-varying arrivals. We use a Markov-modulated Poisson Process to characterize variability in the arrival rate and develop a matrix-geometric method (MGM)-based approach to solve the network. The solution method is validated through extensive numerical experiments. Further, we develop a stochastic model of the landside operations at an automated container terminal with time-varying truck arrivals and evaluate using the MGM-based approach. Results show that commonly used time-homogeneous approximation of time-varying truck arrivals is inaccurate (error is more than 15% in expected waiting time and expected number of trucks waiting outside the terminal) for performance evaluation of the landside operations. The application results are insightful in resource planning, demand leveling, and regulating the number of trucks permitted inside the terminal.}

However, with their increasing distance from the shore, greater water depths, and increasing sizes of the plants, the industry has to face the challenge to develop sustainable installation procedures. Important limiting factors for offshore wind farm installation are the weather conditions and installation strategies. In this context, the focus of this research is the investigation of the most effective approach to installing offshore wind farms at sea, including the effects of weather conditions. This target is achieved through the implementation of a discrete-event simulation approach which includes the analysis of the environmental conditions, distance matrix, vessel characteristics, and assembly scenarios. The model maps the logistics chain in the offshore wind industry. A deterministic and a probabilistic metocean data method have been compared and cross validated. The results point to a good agreement between the two considered models, while highlighting the huge risks to the time and cost of the installation due to the stochastic nature of the weather. We suggest that simulations may improve and reduce these risks in the planning process of offshore wind farms.}

Returns process management, as a part of reverse logistics, has become an important field of performance improvement, especially in businesses with seasonal demand patterns, like fashion, books, or electronics. Consequently, unsold articles are often commercialized through secondary channels, such as outlet stores. To approach the management of reverse logistics systems, models used to optimize the forward flow of articles have been analyzed and adjusted to cope with the characteristics of reverse flows. Despite the recognized impact of cross-docking in forward logistics, approaches to apply this strategy in the returns context are lacking. This paper demonstrates how cross-docking can be implemented in a reverse logistics context and it proposes a corresponding linear programming model. Results show that the application of “reverse cross-docking” can increase the efficiency of reverse logistics in terms of cost reductions, time savings, and improvement of information management in returns processes. Sensitivity analyses show that a reverse cross-docking system can help companies to improve competitiveness in situations where (a) the outlet flexibility related to products and quantities received is high, (b) the probability of returns from secondary markets is low, or (c) the combination of return and cross-docking costs in comparison with warehousing costs are low. The reverse cross-docking model in its basic form covers the main system characteristics and is flexible for further extensions. An extension presented herein refers to the consideration of heterogeneous article prices, indicating the usefulness of reverse cross-docking, particularly in industries with low price levels.}

Modern advanced measurement systems should analyze both the performance of individual organizations in the supply chains and the performance of a supply chain as a whole (integrated approach). Many international researches show that lack of information about the situation in the entire supply chain and lack of methods to analyze the entire network of partners is one of the most important barriers to improve the performance. A questionnaire survey was carried out within the research project ʽMeasuring the performance of supply chains in the largest production and commercial companies in Poland’. The survey involved a sample of 79 senior level managers responsible for logistics/supply chain management of the companies listed on the ʽRanking of 500 largest companies in Poland by Rzeczpospolita Daily’. It was carried out with the use of CATI (Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing) method. The final form of the questionnaire was adopted after conducting a pilot study with logistics / supply chain directors of three leading companies in Poland. Methods of supply chain performance measurement used on Polish market do not take into account to a sufficient degree all the cooperating partners in the extended supply chain (from suppliers’ suppliers to the final consumer), what has a negative impact on the performance of these chains. The research results indicate that the main barriers to the implementation of advanced measurement systems include: insufficient awareness of managers concerning the role of supply chains management in building the real value, low tendency to invest in advanced tools that support such measurement, fear of increase in costs, as well as reluctance to share information with partners. The study shows a potential to improve existing achievements, which should arouse interest of companies. Awareness among managers about potential for improving the performance of supply chains by using integrated measurement and adequate management information on the entire system should have an impact on tendency to invest in tools to support such measurement. The study fills the gap in the existing literature on logistics and supply chain management. This is the only research that treats this topic comprehensively on Polish market and is a base for benchmarking studies in Europe and worldwide.}

abstract = {A recent trend to engage and promote sustainable behaviors in transport foresees gamification, i.e. the use of game design elements in nongame contexts. To foster the expected behavior change, one should appropriately conceive, deploy and manage gamification. The paper addresses the problem of gamification design by proposing an advanced user-centered approach accounting for players’ heterogeneous preferences. This is performed using stated preference methods and is applied to a reverse logistics case study. By comparing the results obtained with the proposed approach to those derived from the traditionally adopted ones, the paper shows that the former would provide considerable new insights with respect to players’ heterogeneous preferences, thus, possibly, increasing the chance of achieving satisfactory results. The paper suggests that, whenever designing gamification to foster engagement and behavior change in transport, one should adopt a user-centered approach based on stated choice experiments to maximize its probability of success.}

Any changes aimed at increasing productivity in that vehicles category would result in a very positive way in the road freight transport market, by lowering transport costs, decreasing environmental costs, rationalizing the sector and improving logistics market. Therefore it is discussed here the improvement derived from the transfer of HGV that currently have a limitation of 40 tons GVM to a new limit of 44 tons GVM, establishing the potential benefits that would be set after the change.}

However, many UCCs strongly rely on government subsidies and are granted a short life because of their inability to reach financial sustainability. Despite the interest from both the practitioners and the research community in this city logistics scheme, there are a limited number of quantitative contributions that investigate the financial viability of UCC schemes. This paper provides a comprehensive theoretical framework for testing the financial viability of UCC cross-docking and consolidation operations and applies it to a specific case of a UCC servicing Brussels. Major cost categories are identified and human resources are pinpointed as a major cost category. The paper demonstrates that profitable operations are in theory possible but that profits are highly fragile and subject to efficient use of resources. The paper identifies a series of operational metrics that drive the profitability of UCC operations and highlight that the efficient organization of distribution operations has a major influence on its financial viability. Finally, the paper discusses the influence of the size of vehicles and service area on the UCC profitability.}

The off-peak delivery, the internalization of the unloading operation and the implementation of a freight distribution center were evaluated. From the results analysis, off-peak delivery and the use of a distribution center were the most pointed options by retailers. The results indicate that it is possible to identify sustainable solutions, from the city point of view, to urban freight distribution, when all stakeholders are included in the discussion. Furthermore, the off-peak operation is an important alternative for delivery vehicles to retailers, associated with the use of a distribution center for stock maintenance.}

The problem is motivated by the status quo of logistics in some U.S. agriculture markets, but adapts to other relevant two-echelon supply chains, e.g. combined production planning and distribution. We first identify special cases where solving single-echelon subproblems sequentially yields an asymptotically optimal solution. For the general case, we propose an iterative framework that consists of a decomposition procedure and a local search scheme. In the decomposition, a freight consolidation subproblem is first solved to obtain crucial shipping decisions, and after fixing these a restrictive model generates the other decisions for the integrated problem. The local search aims at fast identification of good neighborhoods by solving an assignment-style mixed-integer program that matches the consolidation decision with an inventory routing subproblem, and gradually strengthens the incumbent solution pool when executed in an iterative fashion. Experiments based on empirical demand distributions demonstrate that our proposed iterative framework is quite efficient compared to a sequential approach, and that it effectively solves challenging instances.}

A total of 40 journal articles are selected from Web of Science and Google Scholar databases, and are reviewed by categorizing them into single-objective and multiple-objective models. The review suggests that studies with single-objective models covered areas including waste management (in reverse logistics models), returnable transport item management (in closed-loop supply chain models), waste prevention and reduction (in models with perishable products), and emission reduction (in models with emission caps and carbon price). Studies on reverse logistics are limited to collecting and storing waste at a collection site, while including waste processing and disposal operations could make them more applicable. Studies on closed-loop supply chains are few with a focus on managing returnable transportation items. Future studies could consider remanufacturing, recycling and disposal of products for efficient waste management. Most of the papers in logistics of perishable products considered waste prevention rather than waste reduction. Previous studies related to emission reduction using carbon policies mainly focused on emissions from transportation. Including emissions from other logistics operations could be useful from a practical perspective. Relatively few studies developed multi-objective models. Environmental objectives in multi-objective models focused on minimizing total emissions. Few studies considered social objectives related to minimizing inventory of hazardous material and infectious medical waste, and improving customer satisfaction. Other social aspects such as those related to traffic congestion and job creation could be considered in future studies. Furthermore, application of efficient models and solution approaches to real case studies could be valuable.}

abstract = {When considering a complete ecological assessment of logistics activities and the development of comprehensive decarbonization strategies, it's important to address not only transportation but the warehousing and transshipment processes as well. In national inventories, the total energy demand of warehousing can equal around one quarter of the transport emissions. The issue of energy-efficient processes at logistics facilities gains importance because of changing regulations and market requirements (e.g. the new European Energy Efficiency Directive which prioritizes the energy demand of buildings). Furthermore, logistics companies tend to realize energetic and/or ecological improvements at logistics facilities and report savings achieved. As opposed to logistics facilities, the ecological assessment of transportation and the derivation of appropriate environmental performance indicators (EPI) are widely standardized (cf. EN 16258). How to assess, monitor and manage greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) at warehouses or terminals are still major research and standardization issues. That is why the Fraunhofer Institute for Material Flow and Logistics has defined a comprehensive assessment approach for logistics facilities, calculated specific emission factors and developed a flexible yet detailed allocation scheme for different logistics services (e.g. refrigerated warehousing). This article addresses the developed method and provides an argumentative basis for further standardization. This will be realized by the presentation of a classification scheme for logistics facilities based on ecological aspects and the consideration of attributes of logistics items in the discussion about how GHG emissions of logistics facilities are usually influenced. To illustrate strengths and weaknesses of the method, exemplary implementations at facilities of the research partner, DB Schenker, will be published. Focus will be on the emissions of a cross-docking center, a warehouse and a spare parts depot. The provided assessment method for GHG emissions of logistics facilities and the allocation scheme for EPIs enable logistics companies to monitor and manage the emissions of goods storage and transshipments on a continual basis. Consequently, the method can trigger the development of decarbonization strategies at logistics facilities and foster an organizational or technological improvement process.}

The study employed panel Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimates for robust inferences. The results have revealed that logistics operations consume energy and fossil fuel, while the amount of fossil fuel and non-green energy sources create significant harmful effect on the environmental sustainability and also have negative effect on economic growth. In addition, poor transport-related infrastructure and logistics service are a major contributor of CO2 and total greenhouse gas emissions. However, carbon emission damages fauna and flora, and reduces economic growth. The findings suggest that renewable energy sources and green practices can mitigate harmful effect of logistics operations on environmental sustainability and spur economic activities with greatly export opportunities in a region.}

Logistics missions are triggered by on-orbit missions and there are complex interactions between different missions. Based on the computational efficiency afforded by event-based simulation, Discrete Event Simulation (DES) is used to model diverse on-orbit and logistics missions holistically within an integrated scenario and schematize it as a discrete system. It helps to quickly evaluate the physical feasibility and performance effectiveness of complex space station operations. Moreover, operational uncertainty is introduced into the DES model, comprising launch delays of visiting vehicles and onboard emergencies hazarding the safeties of space station or astronauts. Monte Carlo simulation is adopted to help in stochastic analyses and five measurable metrics are further defined to quantify the impact of uncertainty on nominal scenarios. The proposed DES model and associated metrics are demonstrated with both nominal and contingency operations. Simulation results indicate that such an approach is effective and efficient in simulating space station operations and able to support the top-level mission design of China's future space station program.}

The old existing 24 Port authorities are replaced by 15 Authorities of port- system, in which different ports are combined in order to create an efficient port system able to compete and succeed in the overall system of commercial traffic in the Mediterranean Sea. Within this framework, the creation of a new Authority is provided, which incorporates the former Calabrian Port System with the old Port Authority of Messina. In this way we are going to create a large port system, centred on the area of the Messina Strait, comprising 10 ports, including the transhipment port of Gioia Tauro, which represents the core of the entire port system, and the port of Messina, the most important passenger port in Italy and one of the most important as regards the cruise sector. The article analyses the development perspectives that this system can offer with regard to two important aspects: the realization of the project -already imagined in the late’60s- for an Integrated Metropolitan Area of the Strait, including the two metropolitan cities of Messina and Reggio Calabria; the transformation of the port of Gioia Tauro, from an exclusively transhipment port into an Intermodal Logistics Pole, which will be the central strategic hub of a large logistics platform of the Strait Area, whose implementation should be a great opportunity for the development of the entire Mezzogiorno.}

The ship is able to visit a port only if the amount of cargo it carries is compatible with the draft limit of the port. We present an integer linear programming formulation and we show how classical valid inequalities from the literature can be adapted to the considered problem. We introduce heuristic procedures and a branch-and-cut exact algorithm.

Recent researches have focused on the material flow for different end-of-life vehicles. However, the primary question for an end-of-life vehicles recovery network is to determine optimal network nodes. To account for it, we considered a facility location allocation problem of end-of-life vehicles recovery network, and established a mathematical model to solve it. The model is used to achieve the minimization of cost for deciding optimal locations of end-of-life vehicles recovery network. The facility location allocation problem is a non-deterministic polynomial complete problem proved with increase in the number of candidate locations. This type of problem usually handled by a metaheuristics. Therefore, we proposed a valid novel approach based on artificial bee colony to solve the problem. Artificial bee colony is an optimization method that imitates bee behavior. Also, the proposed algorithm is applied to two different scale real-life cases, and some comparisons with several presented algorithms are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the presented method.}

abstract = {Transport infrastructure is essential to moving over 85 million tonnes of agricultural products and 30 million cubic metres of timber from farms and production areas to domestic and international markets each year in Australia. Agriculture supply chains in Australia are characterised by long distances with transport costs accounting for up to 40 percent of the market price. Targeted infrastructure investment and/or regulatory changes can substantially reduce transport-related logistics costs. To provide a comprehensive view of transport logistics costs and benefits due to infrastructure investments and regulatory changes in agriculture and forestry supply chains, CSIRO developed a computer-based tool – the Transport Network Strategic Investment Tool (TraNSIT). TraNSIT optimises transport routes for upto hundreds of thousands of enterprises and millions of vehicle trips between farms and their markets, providing information on routing to maximise cost efficiencies. Through an Australian Government initiative, TraNSIT was applied to over 30 commodities representing 98% of Australian agricultural and plantation forestry volume transported by road and rail. TraNSIT is now a comprehensive logistics tool that has been applied to the largest agricultural supply chain dataset ever assembled in Australia. This paper provides an overview of TraNSIT, its adaptation to agriculture and forestry logistics as part of the project, and its application to several case studies in Australia including new road links, rail versus road and flooding.}

Logistics service providers are challenged to cope with high competition, a consumer-driven economy, failed delivery issues, reverse logistics and environmental measures taken by policymakers, which are all putting pressure on the costs. The last-mile of these deliveries, widely accepted as the most expense part of the trip, is a trade-off between internal costs, externalities and the density of deliveries. Little is known so far about the actual impacts of e-commerce on transport and logistics on society. In this paper, we first analyse the spatial distribution of e-commerce deliveries during a 4-month period in Belgium. Next, we propose a methodology based on the total vehicle-kilometres travelled to calculate the external costs per parcel at the national level. The results show that despite the high urbanization in the country, the e-commerce consumption per capita is higher in rural areas while the total number of kilometres travelled remains similar to that in urban areas. While urban areas undergo most of the disadvantages related to the e-commerce last-mile, the average external cost per parcel was found to be higher in rural areas.}

The methodology includes an extensive research into economic market and non-market valuation literature for social sustainability. This paper integrates a new approach to the current academic literature highlighting social aspects of sustainability within the supply chain and specifically in reverse logistics. The literature review led to the development of a framework guiding and simplifying these efforts. Practical situations of environmental goods valuations of social sustainability in reverse logistics are provided as an illustration. Using organizational supply chains and reverse logistics as an example, the application of various tools is presented using an environmental goods valuation framework. The integration of these topics aid researchers, policy makers, and practitioners. The findings make a contribution to the strategic organizational justification, performance measurement and sustainability literature by further integrating environmental goods valuation tools, models, theory and practices.

Designing either component requires a technology specific one-time investment and the components have different characteristics, notably in terms of production leadtime, production costs and component reliability. We support the design decision with a model that is based on evaluating the lifecycle costs of both components, covering design costs, maintenance and downtime costs, and performance benefits. We derive analytic properties of the required reliability and costs of the AM component such that its total lifecycle costs break even with that of its regular counterpart. Through our analysis, a numerical experiment and cases from two different companies, we find that component reliability and production costs are crucial to the success of AM components, while AM component design costs can be overcome to a certain degree by generating performance benefits or by using the short AM production leadtime to lower the after-sales logistics costs.}

Carbon-dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emission on a road, for instance, depends on the transportation mode and vehicle type selected along the road. The handling cost of a load at a transshipment city also depends on the change of transportation mode and vehicle type from inbound to outbound at the city. Compared with traditional network structure, multi-modal network is characterized by multi-attributes link and dependent transshipment node (in terms of minimizing total cost and emission), which significantly increases problem complexity. This study attempts to address key issues in modeling and analysis of such systems. Analytical models are developed to characterize the problem structure/features explicitly and integrate decisions at single- and multi-objective levels. A set of experiments, designed based on real transportation logistics network, are carried out to verify and validate models’ functions, analyze sensitivity of parameters, and evaluate solution convergence behavior. The results indicated that while the problem is NP-hard, solutions via proper analytical models can be derived efficiently for problems of practical scale.}

The study aimed at identifying which farmers' context characteristics, logistics and quality control activities relate with the generation of PHL in tomato supply chains, particularly in Zimbabwe. Commercial and subsistence tomato farmers (n = 197) from five major tomato-growing areas were analysed using a diagnostic tool to assess the status of logistics and quality control activities, the vulnerability of farmers' context, and the actual PHL. Hierarchical cluster analysis resulted in three clusters of farmers grouped based on similarities on context vulnerability and status of logistics and quality control activities. Spearman's rank correlation analysis and multiple linear regression analyses revealed that more advanced logistics and control activities, and context characteristics with a lower vulnerability to PHL are associated with less postharvest losses. The context characteristics, features of storage facilities, features of cropping system, and market price stability were significant determinants (p < .05) and explained 29% (Adjusted R2 = 0.287) of the variation in the PHL. The logistics control activity, determining processing volumes was identified as a possible determinant (p < .05) and explained 21% (Adjusted R2 = 0.205) of the variation in the observed PHL. The quality control activities, deciding on maturity to harvest, deciding on moment to harvest, and storage practices were the identified determinants (p < .05), which explained 23% (Adjusted R2 = 0.230) of the variability in the observed postharvest losses. A framework of intervention strategies tailored to tomato farmers' development stage is proposed to support them in a step-wise improvement of logistics and quality control practices to reduce PHL and advance towards more advanced supply chains.}

In doing so, all logistics subsystems of a retail chain, i.e., warehousing, transportation and instore logistics, are jointly scheduled. We propose a novel model to minimize total costs in all associated subsystems of a retail distribution chain. A solution approach is developed for clustering stores and selecting delivery patterns that reflects practical requirements. A broad numerical analysis demonstrates cost savings of 2.5 percent on average compared to a state-of-the-art approach (see Sternbeck & Kuhn, 2014). This considerable cost reduction potential is confirmed by applying the suggested approach to a real case of a major European grocery retailer.}

In the past years, the Operations Research/Operations Management community has shown a growing interest in the logistical aspects of vaccination.

A broader framework is needed so that open research questions can be identified more easily and contributions are not overlooked. In this literature review, we combine the priorities of the World Health Organization for creating a flexible and robust vaccine supply chain with an Operations Research/Operations Management supply chain perspective. We propose a classification for the literature on vaccine logistics to structure this relatively new field, and identify promising research directions. We classify the literature into the following four components: (1) product, (2) production, (3) allocation, and (4) distribution. Within the supply chain classification, we analyze the decision problems for existing outbreaks versus sudden outbreaks and developing countries versus developed countries. We identify unique characteristics of the vaccine supply chain: high uncertainty in both supply and demand; misalignment of objectives and decentralized decision making between supplier, public health organization and end customer; complex political decisions concerning allocation and the crucial importance of deciding and acting in time.}

So far, planning approaches for electric fleets either address routing decisions with emphasis on the limited driving range and long charging times of the vehicles, or focus on the siting of charging stations in order to implement the necessary charging infrastructure. In this paper, we present a location routing approach to consider routing of electric vehicles and siting decisions for charging stations simultaneously in order to support strategic decisions of logistics fleet operators. Thereby, we regard different recharging options due to real world constraints. Furthermore, we also take alternative objective functions into account minimizing not only the traveled distance, but also the number of vehicles needed and the number of charging stations sited as well as total costs. Results are presented for the total traveled distance of the location routing model, and potential improvements compared to a vehicle routing model are shown. Shorter overall distances can be achieved if simultaneous siting as well as extended recharging options are allowed. Besides, results for the other objective functions are shown with respect to the impact of the objectives and conflicting targets.}

It emerges that agent-based simulation models are suitable for use in simulating urban freight distribution, identifying a set of agents (at most, one agent per stakeholder) that operate to achieve their objectives, following rules, interacting, and learning from experience.

However, the high demands of their jobs can often lead them to overlook their health and well-being, which can negatively impact drivers, their firms, and supply chains. This is a critical issue that has largely been overlooked in the logistics and transportation literature. The purpose of this paper is to identify the issue and some of its key components in order to induce awareness in the logistics community. It also seeks to motivate future research that may help to alleviate the problems that may arise as a result of unhealthy truck drivers.

Everyday, a third-party logistics (3PL) company receives a number of orders from several auto manufacturers and needs to assign the orders to available trucks which pick up the orders from the warehouses where the orders are kept and deliver them to dealers. Each order corresponds to a specific car required by a given dealer and is associated with a value and one of the three car types, small, medium or large. The value of an order is defined by whether it is an emergency order and how many days it has been waiting to be assigned to a truck. Each delivery truck is allowed to visit a pre-specified subset of cities, and is associated with a specific capacity configuration, which specifies the number of slots available for each of the three car types. The problem is to assign a subset of the orders to available trucks and create a route for each truck to maximize the total reward of the assigned orders, defined as a given weight times the total value of the assigned orders minus the total transportation cost incurred, subject to a number of constraints. A column generation based heuristic algorithm is developed where the LP relaxation of the problem is decomposed into a master problem solved by a LP solver and a number of subproblems solved by a dynamic programming based algorithm. The proposed algorithm is evaluated by comparing its solutions to upper bounds and shown to be capable of generating near-optimal solutions for practically sized problems in reasonable computational time. The algorithm is also compared to a rule-based greedy method used in practice based on real data sets from a 3PL company and shown to outperform the greedy method by a large margin.}

abstract = {Two-tier city logistics is a well-established concept to achieve high levels of consolidation in urban freight distribution. With the recent shift towards offering same day delivery, service providers in parcel delivery are looking at new solutions to deal with the resulting challenges. We introduce autonomous vehicles as an upcoming technology to this field of research and consider a mixed fleet in the first tier of city logistics. Because autonomy cannot be ensured on all roads of the network, we handle the heterogeneous infrastructure with manually operated vehicles serving as platoon leaders. In our proposed MILP formulation of service network design for autonomous vehicles in platoons (SNDAVP), we show how platooning can be incorporated into this tactical planning problem. Computational experiments on first instances are conducted using CPLEX.}

The simulation results are analysed in terms of service rates, delays, and queue sizes at terminals, and is compared to impact on queues of non-cooperative approaches. The proposed approach is expected to influence the functionality of autonomous vehicles in transport logistics, in the future.}

Traditionally, plant managers and logistics providers have long been dissatisfied with extensive waiting times and severe on-site congestion. In this context, we tackle the problem of scheduling a set of trucks arriving at an assembly plant to deliver parts to specific dock doors on the factory premises. Trucks must visit a given set of doors, and they have individual arrival and due dates. They should be scheduled such that the total weighted tardiness is minimal. We propose a mixed-integer programming model and develop bounding procedures and heuristics, which are shown to perform well in a computational study, yielding small optimality gaps in under a minute of runtime. Our tests also reveal that door assignment and time window management have a substantial impact on on-premise congestion.}

Managerial implications and suggestions for future research are discussed.}

abstract = {One of the key objectives of humanitarian logistics is to guarantee the timely delivery of supplies to people affected by disasters during the response phase. In this regard, it is fundamental to design appropriate models to minimize the social costs of response operations to distribute essential supplies to populations in need. In addition to merely cover logistics cost, social costs include deprivations costs, which are an increasing function of deprivation time, derived from the human suffering caused by the lack of access to a good or a service. This research uses the theory of discrete choices to assess deprivation costs due to the time spent waiting for the delivery of a basket of basic supplies, defined as the changes in the welfare of people affected by disasters. To this end, we designed a stated choice survey, applied to people living in areas affected by floods and earthquakes in Colombia. The estimated models consider the influence of individual's socioeconomic characteristics and random effects on the deprivation cost functions. The functions have a nonlinear structure, strictly increasing, and convex on the deprivation time. The results are useful for estimating the social costs of humanitarian relief operations.}

But also what the model philosophy (e.g. aggregate, disaggregate, deterministic, stochastic) should be and which influencing factors should be included. New directions are discussed, such as the trend to include more aspects of logistics decisions of firms. This increases the data requirements of the models. The potential of big data is discussed as well as approaches that use less data but more assumptions.}

abstract = {As increasing transportation costs mounts pressure on the businesses, there has been an increasing interest on vehicle routing problem (VRP) as a viable and effective solution. Both industry and academia are continuously looking for new approaches to save transport cost and time while increasing profit margins. This endeavor will eventually reduce costs of delivering goods and services for customers, and therefore enhancing the competitiveness of firms involved. Particularly, transportation cost savings could have potential impacts on marketing activities of remanufactured and recycled products in reverse logistics chains. Therefore, developing practical solutions for VRP of original and remanufactured products is one the emerging topics in the current transportation research. In this article, we propose a multi-objective non-linear programming model for the green vehicle routing problem (GVRP), including original and remanufactured products distribution (both delivery and pickup) of end of life (EOL) products. Through the appropriate fuzzy approach the model is linearized, validated, and solved. The results show considerable level of improved performance under the model configurations and proposed solution approach. The obtained results clearly indicate that the proposed mathematical model is capable of reducing the fuel cost, distribution center set-up cost and supplying vehicles, as well as minimizing air pollution. Finally, using a real case study the reliability and viability of the proposed model is verified.}

By implementing the main-objective method, the uncertain multi-objective model can be rebuilt as an uncertain single-objective optimization model. The properties of the model are discussed in the framework of uncertainty theory. A hybrid intelligent algorithm that integrates uncertain simulation and a genetic algorithm is designed to solve the proposed model. Finally, numerical examples are presented to illustrate the optimization ideas and the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.}

Multimodal transportation is a key component of modern logistics systems, especially for long-distance transnational transportation. This paper explores the various alternative routes for laptop exports from Chongqing, China to Rotterdam, the Netherlands. It selects seven available routes for laptop transportation from Chongqing to Rotterdam. The multimodal model was adopted to demonstrate alternative routes using various factors such as transport cost, transfer cost, transit time, transport distance, document charge, port congestion surcharge, customs charge, confidence index and so on. Among possible alternative routes, the results indicate that the route 6 was the fastest routes except for the air transport (route 7), while the route 1 was the cheapest and safest way. Nonetheless, route 1 may be not suitable for the laptop transport due to the importance of timeliness. The logisticians may able to utilize this research's findings to make a balance between transit time and transport cost for effective multimodal transport of laptops from Chongqing to Rotterdam.}

The application of standardized approaches improves the efficiency of logistic operations. This paper presents a conceptual framework based on the Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) standard for analyzing the efficiency of logistic operations at port terminals. The paper contributes to logistics research by studying time efficiency in the management of trailers and cargo at terminals based on the adoption of the international EPCIS standard. The literature was reviewed to establish a conceptual framework and a case study was then conducted regarding time efficiency in managing the export and import of trailers and transshipments of cargo between trailers at two port terminals in the United Kingdom and one port terminal in the Netherlands. The findings show that by adopting the EPCIS standard, port operators can improve logistic management efficiency, including the arriving, transporting, receiving, inspecting, outbound staging, loading, picking-up, unloading, re-packing, and shipping operations of trailers. This paper identifies how, when managing trailers at port terminals, applying a conceptual framework based on an international standard can improve logistical efficiency so that this management is consistent with the development of a global standard used to enhance planning, traceability, and safety in the port sector.}

abstract = {This paper considers a horizontal logistics cooperation in which multiple companies jointly solve their logistics optimisation problem. To capture the individual partner interests in the logistics optimisation model, we allow each individual partner to set its own set of objectives. In such a situation, the question arises whether only these individual partner objectives should be considered during the optimisation of the collaborative optimisation problem (the partner efficiency approach), or whether a set of coalition objectives should be defined first (the coalition efficiency approach). This paper investigates the merits and drawbacks of both approaches by applying them to a collaborative variant of the well-known travelling salesman problem with soft time windows (coltspstw). Our results confirm that, even in a situation in which each partner has multiple, possibly conflicting objectives, joining a horizontal logistics coalition can be beneficial for all partners. We further conclude that the coalition efficiency approach is able to find good quality solutions with less calculation time, but lacks robustness. The partner efficiency approach, on the other hand, is able to provide the decision maker with a better Pareto front approximation for the individual partner interest, at the expense of a higher complexity.}
