abstract = {Abstract:
As the speed of mobile phone updates continues to accelerate, the self-service mobile phone recycling mode, led by third-party reverse logistics providers (3PRLs), has ushered in an important developmental era. This paper proposes a novel interval-valued Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy best-worst multi-criteria large group decision-making method to research the selection of 3PRLs. To minimize the influence of subjective factors and maximize the mathematical analysis method, some related improvements have been made to the traditional best worst method (BWM). First, in order to make an effective strategic assessment and achieve overall optimization of the organization, evaluators are grouped by the self-organized maps (SOM) method to balance the coordination ability and professional level of different groups. Next, the interval Pythagoras hesitant fuzzy set (IPHFS) is used to evaluate the criteria of 3PRLs selection. Then, according to above evaluation results, the BWM method and deviation model are combined to determine the weights of criteria. Finally, the traditional BWM is extended by ranking functions to determine the optimal 3PRL. The applicability of the proposed method is numerically demonstrated by solving a real case, and the key conclusions are that the technical factor is important to affecting the choice of 3PRLs. At the same time, the quantity and price of recycled components on End of Life (EOL) and used mobile phones also have important impacts on the selection of 3PRLs.}

We introduce a new modeling approach based on linear and non-stationary (max, +) equations obtained from a Timed Coloured Petri Nets (TCPN) describing the studied system’s behavior. Our contribution does not lie only on the modeling of the dynamics associated with vehicles and their timetables at different sites (e.g., suppliers, warehouses, customers), but also on the evaluation of loading, unloading, and delivery times of products from suppliers to customers, taking into account their appropriate characteristics (e.g., number, nature, destination). Moreover, a control approach is performed to optimize the number of vehicles to deploy on the network by ensuring product storage times below a given threshold at some specific sites considered strategic (e.g., delivery hubs). The developed models can be used as a decision-making system for logistic companies to result in efficient supply chain management. The developed models are tested and validated on several configurations and scenarios to demonstrate our approach’s applicability.}

Even though this problem arises often in public planning, this is the first known paper solving this class of problem for more than one facility in continuous space where capacity is considered. The problem is solved using a bi-objective evolutionary strategy algorithm that seeks to minimize social and non-social costs. The effects of under and over capacitating the facility are included in the cost functions. Two case study problems are solved, one involving the siting of fire stations in a college town, the other locating solid waste transfer stations in a major metropolitan area. The solutions produced by the model are compared to the real-world placement of the facilities. The algorithm yields many non-dominated solutions covering the whole range of values for both objectives in a short amount of time. Also considered are the effects of adding multiple facilities sequentially as happens in a real-world, phased implementation that spans years, as opposed to placing the facilities all at once.}

This paper addresses the capacitated dynamic lot-sizing problem with external procurement, defective and backordered items, setup times, and extra capacity. The problem is to determine how many end-of-life products to disassemble during each period. We propose a new mixed-integer programming (MIP) approach to formulate the problem under study in order to maximize the disassembly-process gain, which is obtained as the difference between the revenue achieved by resale of the items recovered after disassembly and the costs tied to operating the disassembly tasks. Several numerical tests using the well-known CPLEX solver proved that this new model can find the optimal disassembly schedule for most test instances within an acceptable computational time. Furthermore, we led sensitivity studies on disassembly capacity, setup time and procurement cost. Test results validate the power of the suggested model and provide helpful insights for industry practitioners.}

The MCSRP consists of identifying the schedule and route of heterogeneous crews that must perform the restoration of damaged nodes used in the paths to connect a source node to demand nodes in a network affected by extreme events. The objective is to minimize the accessibility time defined as the time that the demand nodes remain unconnected from the source node. The main contributions of the paper include three novel mathematical formulations that differ in the way of modeling the scheduling decisions and the synchronization of the crews, and the development of valid inequalities based on some particular properties of the problem. Additionally, we prove that the MCSRP is NP-hard. Extensive numerical experiments with randomly generated instances and a case study based on floods and landslides disasters in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, are performed to assess the efficiency and applicability of our approach. In particular, we show that the valid inequalities significantly improve the solvability of the mathematical models. In terms of managerial implications, our results suggest that the incorporation of multiple crews helps to reduce the worst-case accessibility times across the demand nodes, thus providing more equitable solutions.}

From the results of the empirical test, the results of the classification method are generally better than the results of the regression, and in the classification method, the results of the SVM are better than the results of the random forest.

We study the post-disaster road clearing problem with the aim of providing a fast and effective method to determine the route of a work troop responsible for clearing blocked roads. The problem is to find a route for the troop that starts at the depot and visits all of the critical locations. The objective is to minimize the total latency of critical nodes, where the latency of a node is defined as the travel time from the depot to that node. A mathematical model for this problem has already been developed in the literature. However, for real-life instances with more than seven critical nodes, this exact formulation cannot solve the problem optimally in a 3-hour limit. To find a near-optimal solution in a short running time, we develop a heuristic that solves a mixed integer program on a transformed network and a lower bounding method to evaluate the optimality gaps. Alternatively, we develop a metaheuristic based on a combination of Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) and Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS). We test both the matheuristic and the metaheuristic on Istanbul data and show that optimal or near-optimal solutions are obtained within seconds. We also compare our algorithms with existing work in the literature. Finally, we conduct an analysis to observe the trade-off between total and maximum latency.}

The researchers employed a case study of mining sector, where descriptive data research method was utilized with a target population comprising 1000 companies and a sample of 91 organizations was obtained, using Slovin’s equation. The researchers adopted the convenience sampling technique which involved the choice of subjects who were well equipped with relevant information to the researchers focus. A convenient sample size of 40 mining companies in Zimbabwe was selected based on of researchers’ easy accessibility to them. The findings revealed that, presently there is absence of structural and organisational change to support implementation of sustainable supply chain management.

The cost efficient availability of devices like the HTC Vive has played into the rising amount of research done in this field. The technology is therefore especially interesting for the field of manual order picking. However, users´ rating of virtual reality in order picking in contrast to real world order picking has not yet been examined. The paper at hand therefore addresses this issue and tries to answer the following research questions: 1. How do the participants evaluate the general use of virtual reality technology and its aptitude for training purposes in order picking and does their rating change during the experimental study? 2. Does the rating of the use of virtual reality in order picking by the participants reflect their experimental results? To answer these questions an experimental study was conducted, in which 27 participants first had to pick orders in a virtual warehouse environment and afterwards in an identical real warehouse environment. In order to capture the participants´ evaluation, questionnaires were designed based on scientific approaches. The analysis of the given answers shows that the experimental study has a positive effect on users´ rating of virtual reality simulations in order picking. In conclusion the following article highlights the use of virtual reality simulation in this field and the potential of the technology for future research.}

The occasional drivers can decide to serve some customers by picking up the parcels either from the central depot or from an intermediate one. The objective is to minimize the total cost, that is, the conventional vehicle cost, plus the occasional drivers’ compensation. We formulate the problem and present a variable neighborhood search heuristic. To analyze the benefit of the crowd-shipping transportation system with intermediate depots and to assess the performance of our heuristic, we consider small- and large-size instances generated from the Solomon benchmarks. A computational analysis is carried out with the aim of gaining insights into the behavior of both conventional vehicles and occasional drivers, and of analyzing the performance of our methodology in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. Our computational results show that the proposed heuristic is highly effective and can solve large-size instances within short computational times.}

We also propose a novel exact algorithm, by employing parallel computing techniques, in order to combine local search procedures within a traditional B&C scheme. We evaluate the performance of our methods through extensive computational experiments, both by comparing the algorithms, the effectiveness of the different inventory policies, and the impact of these policies on the partial costs. We derive many managerial insights based on the results. We also validate our new exact algorithm by solving similar problems from the literature, such as the two-echelon multi-depot inventory-routing (2E-MDIRP) and the classical multi-vehicle production-routing problem (MV-PRP). Computational experiments show that our method is very competitive. Based on 512 experiments for the 2E-MDIRP, our algorithm was able to find 111 new best known solutions (BKS), besides proving 412 optimal solutions, against 298 from the literature. For 336 experiments over small and medium size MV-PRP instances, we proved 242 optimal solutions, 11 more than the exact methods from the literature, besides providing 95 new BKS. Moreover, we were the first to tackle large MV-PRP instances exactly, and in this case, our algorithm provides all BKS for instances up to 50 customers, 20 periods and 5 vehicles, outperforming all meta/matheuristics procedures from the literature.}

The formal collection enterprises fail to collect much of the electrical and electronic equipment wastes (WEEE) due to the operational limitations and the households' preference for the traditional door-to-door collection services; this situation has resulted in inappropriate management of the WEEE stream. This study puts forward an integrated collection scheme that simultaneously considers the on-call and door-to-door demands. To explore how to effectively implement the proposed approach, an original capacitated general routing model with time-window (CGRPTW) is studied, which facilitates the general routing methodology for WEEE collection practices. A set of test instances – testbed – based on real data is developed to investigate the proposed collection scheme under various operational situations. On this basis, it is shown that the resulting improvement is more significant under certain operational, i.e. capacity- and time-management decisions. Overall, this study explores trade-offs between profit- and service-oriented paradigms for the management of the collectors' behavior within the integrated WEEE collection scheme.}

We assume it operates in a context of a twofold uncertainty by considering stochastic demand and return processes. From a bullwhip perspective, we evaluate how the four relevant factors (specifically, two capacities and two sources of uncertainty) interact and determine the operational performance of the system by measuring the variability of the manufacturing and remanufacturing lines and the net stock. Interestingly, while the manufacturing capacity only impacts on the forward flow of materials, the remanufacturing capacity affects the dynamics of the whole system. From a managerial viewpoint, this work suggests that capacity constraints in both remanufacturing and manufacturing lines can be adopted as a fruitful bullwhip-dampening method, even if they need to be properly regulated for avoiding a reduction in the system capacity to fulfill customer demand in a cost-effective manner.}

The DSS is developed in cooperation with an industrial partner to help them with their operational decision making when determining the appointment quotas, considering yard resource availability. The underlying approach makes use of a tabu search metaheuristic algorithm to solve a related optimization problem that balance the supply and demand of moves in the yard. The DSS is flexible, allowing several parameters to be configured and read from external files. Experimental examples using real-world data were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the system, and the suitability of the DSS.}

As freight transport is recognized as a serious CO2 emitter, this sector is confronted with a substantial part of the target. For cities, the reduction of the urban freight transport emissions is, next to the CO2 reduction, also important to improve the air quality. Dutch municipalities take an active role in coordination, facilitation and acceleration of the emission reduction processes, not only via regulation but also by using their public procurement power. This paper describes the City of Rotterdam’s experiences from the EU Horizon 2020 BuyZET project. This project was launched in November 2016 and includes the cities of Rotterdam, Oslo and Copenhagen. The project aims at understanding and optimising the impact of public procurement activities on transport patterns and emissions in cities as well as to find innovative and sustainable delivery solutions for goods and services-related transport in order to reduce emissions.}

Typically, a large number of products, services, and opportunities are available in those urban zones, thus increasing life quality. Unfortunately, these benefits are associated with increasing transportation activities that can cause serious problems, such as traffic congestion, excessive energy consumption, and pollution. This paper aims at presenting a new transport system that consists of transporting freight in long-haul passenger vehicles. Two mixed integer mathematical programming models are presented: one for total cost minimization and the other for the travel time minimization. The problem under study was considered as a multi-commodity network flow problem with time windows, multi transport-lines, and multiple vehicles. Three heuristics based on mixed integer programming (MIP) were designed to solve it: size reduction, LP-and-fix, and a combination of these two procedures. The proposed approaches were validated in a case study designed around the intercity passenger transport system, in Ceará, Northeast of Brazil. Several operational scenarios were evaluated, taking into account the available freight capacities. The developed MIP heuristics produced high-quality solutions, in reasonable computational times, with the LP-and-Fix algorithm outperforming the other approaches.}

A process model was developed using a commercial simulator to assess the energy consumption, inputs, and ethanol production, aiming to carry out a preliminary economic analysis for large-scale production in Brazil. Five scenarios for large and medium-sized plants installed in the state of Santa Catarina were created, seeking the lowest logistic cost. Two types of inoculums were chosen in the fermentations: with a monoculture of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and with a coculture of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pachysolen tannophilus (ATCC32691). The highest ethanol yield (0.4 g/g), volumetric productivity (1.1 g/L h), and annual production (32.713 m3) with lower energy expenditure (138.4 GJ/m3) were obtained with fermentation by co-culture with wet pseudostem in the composed broth. Massaranduba is considered the most appropriate municipality of Santa Catarina state for the installation of a biorefinery. In an optimistic scenario, where the energy cogeneration would meet the plant's energy demand, the proposed process is economically viable, with the lowest payback time of 12.4 yr.}

abstract = {In this study, we tackle an integrated fleet sizing and replenishment planning problem in a vendor managed inventory system. There is a set of customers whose inventory must be replenished using a given set of predetermined frequencies for visits, and the customers have deterministic and constant demand. The vehicle fleet consists of multiple types of vehicles that differ in carrying capacity, cost per kilometer, and ownership costs. The main decision we need to make in this problem is the triple assignment of vehicle-frequency-customer. As a result of these assignment decisions, we obtain the annual total cost, which consists of vehicle ownership cost, routing cost, inventory holding, and fixed replenishment costs. A key simplification in the model is the use of linear approximation for the routing cost based on the number of customers visited in a route. The developed model in this study, which is new in the literature, integrates fleet sizing and replenishment planning decisions. We showed that our problem is NP-hard. In order to solve large problems efficiently, we proposed two versions of a fix and optimize type heuristic; with and without a moving sub problem window. We showed the effectiveness of the suggested heuristic solution procedure on a large set of randomly generated problems.}

However, the driving ranges of EVs are limited by the duration of their batteries, which raises some operational challenges. This paper discusses the Location Routing Problem with a Constrained Distance (LRPCD), which is a natural extension of the Location Routing Problem when EVs are utilized. A fast multi-start heuristic and a metaheuristic are proposed to solve the LRPCD. The former combines biased-randomization techniques with the well-known Tillman’s heuristic for the Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing Problem. The latter incorporates the biased-randomized approach into the Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) framework. A series of computational experiments show that the multi-start heuristic is able to generate good-quality solutions in just a few seconds, while the biased-rendomized VNS metaheuristic provides higher-quality solutions by employing more computational time.}

There is a consensus that CO2 fertilisation of agricultural systems has the potential to enhance their productivity. In this paper, the authors present a novel study that involves the development of a simulation model of a GIS-based CO2 fertilisation network comprising of power plants equipped with CO2 capture systems, transportation network, including pipeline and roadways, and agricultural sinks, such as greenhouses. The simulation model is used to specifically train the CO2 distribution agent in order to optimise the logistical performance objectives of the network, namely delivery fulfilment and network utilisation rates. The Pareto non-dominating solutions correspond to an optimal CO2 delivery fleet size of around 1-2 trucks for an average year in the simulation example considered.}

abstract = {In robotic mobile fulfillment systems, human pickers don’t go to the inventory area to search for and pick the ordered items. Instead, robots carry shelves (called “pods”) containing ordered items from the inventory area to picking stations. At the picking stations, pickers put ordered items into totes; then these items are transported to the packing stations. This type of warehousing system relieves the human pickers and improves the picking process. In this paper, we concentrate on decisions about the assignment of pods to stations and orders to stations to fulfill picking for each incoming customer’s order. In previous research for an RMFS with multiple picking stations, these decisions are made sequentially with heuristics. Instead, we present a new MIP-model to integrate both decision problems. To improve the system performance even more, we extend our model by splitting orders. This means parts of an order are allowed to be picked at different stations. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first publication on split orders in an RMFS. And we prove the computational complexity of our models. We analyze different performance metrics, such as pile-on, pod-station visits, robot moving distance and throughput. We compare the results of our models in different instances with the sequential method in our open-source simulation framework RAWSim-O. The integration of the decisions brings better performances, and allowing split orders further improves the performances (for example: increasing throughput by 46%). In order to reduce the computational time for a real-world application, we have proposed a heuristic.}

The purpose of this paper is therefore to provide an overview of current research on key variables to consider when deciding inbound transportation strategy. Those factors are then discussed by looking at the opportunities and challenges they present in the process manufacturing supply chain context, via a case study of a paints and chemicals manufacturing company. Data from the case study was collected during a workshop at the main factory location, and several follow-up interviews. The main opportunities identified are improved sustainability and visibility, while main challenges are increased complexity, and increase in coordination requirements with more collaboration.}

abstract = {Disaster relief centers (DRCs) are the retailers of disaster relief supply chains. Also known as Points of Distribution (PODs), disaster relief centers are ad hoc distribution sites set up in shopping mall parking lots, schools, churches, or warehouses where relief supplies are distributed to beneficiaries. Perhaps the most significant challenges that DRCs face are volunteer and material convergence, which refer to the mass movement of people and supplies, respectively, into affected areas following large-scale disaster events. The handling of donated supplies at DRCs and their subsequent distribution to beneficiaries are carried out almost exclusively by volunteers who also show up and abandon DRCs at random points in time. This paper concerns the assignment of volunteers to tasks at DRCs and takes the following three sources of uncertainty into account: (i) beneficiary arrival and service times, (ii) donation arrival and service times, and (iii) volunteer arrival and abandonment times. We represent the DRC as a queuing system with two parallel queues, one for donors/donations and the other for beneficiaries, and analyze the system in an agent-based simulation environment. In particular, we examine the effectiveness of heuristic policies for assigning volunteers to parallel queues in which performance metrics related to the average time donors and beneficiaries spend in the DRC are minimized. Through extensive computational experimentation, we identify the most effective assignment policies under a variety of experimental conditions.}

Multi-item customer orders often need to be split into multiple shipments because the ordered items may be stored in different warehouses. Order splitting results in higher shipping costs. One way to reduce splitting is to store and retrieve all the items in a single warehouse. However, due to the vast volume of items sold by online supermarkets, it is difficult to build and operate such a warehouse. Another way is to optimize the allocation of products in multiple warehouses to reduce order splitting. In this paper, we propose a K-links heuristic clustering algorithm to optimize the product category allocation among multiple warehouses based on the distribution of multi-item orders to minimize the total number of order splits. Using online order and inventory data from a large Chinese online supermarket, we demonstrate that our algorithm performs well and dramatically reduces order splitting.}

abstract = {When planning routes for fleets of electric commercial vehicles, it is necessary to precisely predict the energy required to drive and plan for charging whenever needed, in order to manage their driving range limitations. Although there are several energy estimation models available in the literature, so far integration with Vehicle Routing Problems has been limited and without demonstrated accuracy. This paper introduces the Two-stage Electric Vehicle Routing Problem (2sEVRP) that incorporates improved energy consumption estimation by considering detailed topography and speed profiles. First, a method to calculate energy cost coefficients for the road network is outlined. Since the driving cycle is unknown, the model generates an approximation based on a linear function of mass, as the latter is only determined while routing. These coefficients embed information about topography, speed, powertrain efficiency and the effect of acceleration and braking at traffic lights and intersections. Secondly, an integrated two-stage approach is described, which finds the best paths between pairs of destinations and then finds the best routes including battery and time-window constraints. Energy consumption is used as objective function including payload and auxiliary systems. The road cost coefficients are aggregated to generate the path cost coefficients that are used in the routing problem. In this way it is possible to get a proper approximation of the complete driving cycle for the routes and accurate energy consumption estimation. Lastly, numerical experiments are shown based on the road network from Gothenburg-Sweden. Energy estimation is compared with real consumption data from an all-electric bus from a public transport route and with high-fidelity vehicle simulations. Routing experiments focus on trucks for urban distribution of goods. The results indicate that time and energy estimations are significantly more precise than existing methods. Consequently the planned routes are expected to be feasible in terms of energy demand and that charging stops are properly included when necessary.}

The preparedness model proposed in this study selects locations and inventory levels of these facilities such that the right mix of relief items can be supplied at the right time. Our mixed integer linear model aims to find a robust relief network design that satisfies the demand for all given disaster scenarios, and to help achieve a better response during the response stage when the relief items are distributed. The assumptions and the parameters used in the model are justified by authorities of humanitarian organizations.

Robots can visit areas with van access restrictions, such as pedestrianized areas or university campuses. The van stops at parking nodes to drop off and/or pick up its robot, and to replenish its robot and/or swap its robot’s battery if needed. Five van/robot pickup and delivery cases are considered, according to the roles the van/robot plays in the process of pickup/delivery and whether the van transports its robot. To model the proposed problem, we introduce a mixed-integer program including time, freight, and energy. We further propose an adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm to solve larger instances and a capacity feasibility test approach for a single route. We then assess the influence of parking node density on model output. A case study based on a realistic city scenario is introduced. A sensitivity analysis is performed on the robot’s travel cost and maximum travel distances, and the effect of van no-go areas is studied. Two classical models (two-echelon vehicle routing with hybrid pickup and delivery and parallel van and robot scheduling with hybrid pickup and delivery) are compared with ours, and results show our model is competitive in appropriate scenario settings. We therefore advocate using the two-echelon van-based robot last-mile pickup and delivery system in urban areas.}

Imposing almost no managerial control over the occasional couriers (OC) to maximize their willingness to participate, the envisioned model suggests using transshipment points to enhance operational efficiency and a company-controlled backup delivery capacity to account for the uncertainty in the crowd-provided delivery capacity. A dynamic programming (DP) approach is developed to address the package routing problem that needs to be solved for the real-time management of the CS network. The suggested methodology does not assume any specific distributions for the courier and demand arrivals and provides the optimal package routing policy when the courier and service point capacities are not binding. Several extensions of the basic DP approach are studied to consider limited courier and service point capacities and take advantage of the extra information provided by those couriers that declare their arrivals in advance. To the best of the author’s knowledge, this study presents the first example of using Monte-Carlo simulations to determine “shadow costs” of capacity utilizations and use them in making the assignment (matching) decisions. An extensive computational study demonstrates the efficacy of the solution approach. It provides valuable insights into, among others, the potential benefits of delivering packages with a coordinated effort of OCs (with transshipments) under short delivery lead time restrictions, the impact of the spatial and temporal distribution of the demand and courier arrivals on the system performance, and the importance of the notice times for OC arrivals.}

Focusing on mobile phones, coffee machines and washing machines as examples, we assessed the stated preferences of Brussels’ consumers using a Choice-Based Conjoint analysis. The results obtained underline the price-driven nature of consumers’ preferences. Consumers also have a high reluctance for incineration but no significant preference for reusing over recycling, and even a preference for recycling in the case of mobile phones. These results also highlight the large differences among product types, especially for the type of service: consumers have a high willingness to pay for home collection of washing machines but have no preference for mobile phones. Income, household structure, professional occupation and availability of a storage room impact the preferences for several collection services’ attributes. These impacts are small and do not concern preferences for recovery processes, identity of the collector, price of collection services and appointment requirements. The results of this study call for a redesign of EEE classifications and for a refinement of collection services to incorporate consumers’ preferences.}

We examine two problems to enhance the network performance by: (i) improving the overall travel time of the transportation network in the day-to-day conditions, and (ii) decreasing fatalities of the disaster by stabilizing the infrastructure to improve the network resiliency. The approach is based on a Stackelberg game, where the policymaker (i.e., the leader) allocates an available budget for either expanding or stabilizing the links of the transportation network. The two follower problems maximize the network performance in pre and post-disaster conditions. The proposed algorithm uses the Particle Swarm Optimization method for optimizing the leader's objective which is to minimize the overall societal costs. We conduct multiple simulations on small and big test cases to verify the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method. The results show a reduction of 10% and 28% in the imposed cost to the society for small and big networks compared to non-integrated method, respectively.}

The high level of neutron activation, however, implies time-consuming maintenance processes occurring during the reactor shutdown, which lower the reactor availability and economic viability. As part of the design process, different concepts are continuously proposed and quantitatively evaluated to optimise the plant performance, a key component of which is maintenance duration. One accurate way to quantitatively evaluate and compare different concepts is to simulate the occurrence of the maintenance activities across the time with a logistical simulation tool. This work aims to present the logistical simulation tool, which has been developed within the DEMO project, along with the methodology used to quantitatively evaluate and compare maintenance concepts. We use the self-developed methodology to assess two example concepts. The first one, called Cask Concept, is based on the utilization of vertical maintenance system casks to replace the In-Vessel components. The casks are remote handling containers that are docked on the upper ports of the machine and provide the interface to extract and insert the pieces of hardware without contamination of the area above the upper ports. The second one, called Hot Cell Concept, is based on an overhead crane system situated above the upper ports of the tokamak using the complete area as a Hot Cell. The results show clear and interesting differences between the two concepts and demonstrate the relevance of the developed methodologies to assessing maintenance durations for new or modified plant concepts.}

Over a planning horizon, the commodity is first sent from a single depot to a set of Distribution Centers (DCs). Then, from the DCs, it is delivered to customers. Two sources of flexibility are analyzed: flexibility in network design and flexibility in due dates. The former is related to the possibility of renting any of the DCs in any period of the planning horizon, whereas the latter is related to the possibility of serving a customer between the period an order is set and a due date. The objective is to minimize the total cost consisting of the sum of the shipping cost from the depot to the DCs, the traveling cost from the DCs to the customers, the renting cost of DCs, and the penalty cost for unmet due dates. A mathematical programming formulation is presented, together with different classes of valid inequalities. Moreover, an exact method is proposed that is based on the interplay between two branch-and-bound algorithms. Computational results on randomly generated instances show the value of each of the two kinds of flexibility. Their combination leads to average savings of up to about 30%.}

abstract = {The vision of a well-integrated supply chain (SC) was developed as early as 1958 by Forrester, who addressed what would eventually be called the Bullwhip Effect (BWE). The Flowcasting concept, originally called Retail Resource Planning, was proposed to connect all SC upper tiers to the storefront through fulfillment logic based on the Distribution Resource Planning (DRP) system. This method can therefore be understood as fully or SC-wide integrated DRP with a focus on the role of retailers instead of that of vendors or distributors. We studied a Canadian retailer that implemented Flowcasting in order to gain insight into the benefits and operational logic of this system. Based on the data obtained from the company, we simulate Flowcasting operations across a 3-tier SC compared to the Reorder Point (ROP) system, which was previously used at the firm, as well as a combination of ROP and DRP (ROP/DRP or partially integrated DRP), which are some of the most common implementations in use. The simulation is configured based on the company's settings, including historical average demand, demand estimates, lead time, etc. Then, multivariate regression is deployed to statistically compare the efficacy of these methods in SC management using various assessment criteria, including BWE measures. The results show that the requirement calculation logic used in an SC-wide integrated DRP system (Flowcasting) generally outperforms the other two approaches, and its benefits in curtailing the BWE become more noticeable in the upper tiers of the SC. This paper indicates the enormous potential of SC-wide integrated DRP logic in rule-based replenishment planning systems.}

Due to the lack of good behavioral models in current simulation packages, many researchers have tried to develop useful behavioral models to improve simulation accuracy, including window behavior models, using field data collected from real buildings. During this work, many mathematical and machine learning methods have been used, and some level of prediction accuracy has been achieved. XGBoost is a recently introduced machine learning algorithm, which has been proven as very powerful in modeling complicated processes in other research fields. In this study, this algorithm has been adopted to model and predict occupant window behavior, aiming to further improve the modeling accuracy from a globally accepted modeling approach, namely, Logistic Regression Analysis. Field data in terms of both occupant window behavior and relevant influential factors were collected from real residential buildings during transitional seasons. Both XGBoost and Logistic Regression Analysis were used to build window behavior models, after a feature selection work, and their prediction performances on an independent dataset were compared. The comparison revealed that XGBoost has solid advantages in modeling occupant window behavior, over Logistic Regression Analysis, and it is expecting that the same finding would be obtained for other behavioral types, such as blind control and air-conditioner operation.}

This paper presents the time-dependent Electric Vehicle Routing Problem with Chance-Constraints (EVRP-CC) and partial recharging. The routing method is divided into two stages, where the first finds the best paths and the second optimizes the routes. A probabilistic Bayesian machine learning approach is proposed for predicting the expected energy consumption and variance for the road links, paths and routes. Hence it is possible to consider the uncertainty in energy demand by planning charging within a confidence interval. The energy estimation is validated with data from electric buses driving a public transport route in Gothenburg-Sweden as well as with realistic simulations for 24 hours traffic in the city of Luxembourg connected to a high fidelity vehicle model. Routing solutions are compared with a deterministic formulation of the problem similar to the ones found in the literature. The results indicate high accuracy for the energy prediction as well as energy savings and more reliability for the routes.}

One way to purchase more medicines with limited funds is to contract with generics manufacturers, thereby increasing competition and lowering prices. However, many POs fear that these entrants are less reliable than others and increase supply risks: failure to adhere to lead times and supplier defaults may cause disruptions that result in unsuccessful medical treatments. The problem can be remedied or at least reduced if POs have a sound basis for assessing manufacturers. To this end, we develop a mathematical framework that supports decision-makers in an integrated evaluation of an entrant’s effect on purchasing costs and supply risks. Our approach accounts for the characteristics of donor-funded global-health markets and the particular tasks and specific challenges of POs in these markets. More specifically, our approach enables a PO to quantify a potential entrant’s value depending on important characteristics of the incumbent and the entrant manufacturer. We use data from a project for donor-funded procurement of Depot Medroxyprogesterone Acetate (DMPA) of two large POs. Our results show the feasibility of our approach for POs, manufacturers, and philanthropic investors in the global-health domain, and we explore the trade-off between competition and supply risks and provide insights into how the entrant’s value is affected by parameters like production costs, capacity, lead time and default risk, and in-country registration.}

Given a setting with multiple fields, a path network connecting these, multiple depots at which a number of harvesters are initially located, the main question addressed is: Which crop out of a set of different crops to assign to each field when accounting for the given setting? It must be answered by every farm manager at the beginning of every work-cycle starting with plant seeding and ending with harvesting. Rather than solving an assignment problem only, it is here also accounted for the connectivity between fields. In practice, fields are often located distant apart. Traveling costs of machinery and limited harvesting windows demand optimized operation and route planning. Therefore, the proposed method outputs crop assignments to fields and simultaneously determines crop-tours, i.e., optimized sequences in which to service fields of the same crop during harvest. It is of particular relevance for larger farms and groups of farms that collaborate and share machinery. Integer programming based exact algorithms are derived. For large numbers of fields, where these algorithms may not be tractable due to computational constraints, elements of clustering and the solution of local Traveling Salesman Problems are added, thereby on the one hand rendering the method heuristic and in general suboptimal, but on the other hand maintaining large-scale applicability.}

We propose a two-stage stochastic programming (SP) model of the problem where the first stage decisions are what vessels to charter. The second stage decisions are how to support maintenance tasks using the chartered vessels from the first stage, given uncertainty in weather conditions and the occurrence of failures. To solve the resulting SP model we perform an ad-hoc Dantzig–Wolfe decomposition where, unlike standard decomposition approaches for SP models, parts of the second stage problem remain in the master problem. The decomposed model is then solved as a matheuristic by apriori generating a subset of the possible extreme points from the Dantzig–Wolfe subproblems. A computational study in three parts is presented. First, we verify the underlying mathematical model by comparing results to leading work from the literature. Then, results from in-sample and out-of-sample stability tests are presented to verify that the matheuristic gives stable results. Finally, we exemplify how the model can help offshore wind farm operators and vessel developers improve their decision making processes.}

abstract = {To accommodate a swift response to fires and other incidents, fire departments have stations spread throughout their coverage area, and typically dispatch the closest fire truck(s) available whenever a new incident arises. However, it is not obvious that the policy of always dispatching the closest truck(s) minimizes the long-run fraction of late arrivals, since it may leave gaps in the coverage for future incidents. Although the research literature on dispatching of emergency vehicles is substantial, the setting with multiple trucks has received little attention. This is despite the fact that here careful dispatching is even more important, since the potential coverage gap is much larger compared to the single-truck case. Moreover, when dispatching multiple trucks, the uncertainty in the trucks’ driving time plays an important role, in particular due to possible correlation in driving times of the trucks if their routes overlap. In this paper we discuss optimal dispatching of fire trucks, based on a particular dispatching problem that arises at the Amsterdam Fire Department, where two fire trucks are sent to the same incident location for a quick response. We formulate the dispatching problem as a Markov Decision Process, and numerically obtain the optimal dispatching decisions using policy iteration. We show that the fraction of late arrivals can be significantly reduced by deviating from current practice of dispatching the closest available trucks, with a relative improvement of on average about 20%, and over 50% for certain instances. We also show that driving-time correlation has a non-negligible impact on decision making, and if ignored may lead to performance decrease of over 20% in certain cases. As the optimal policy cannot be computed for problems of realistic size due to the computational complexity of the policy iteration algorithm, we propose a dispatching heuristic based on a queueing approximation for the state of the network. We show that the performance of this heuristic is close to the optimal policy, and requires significantly less computational effort.}

We represent uncertain travel times simply by specifying a range of values, and implement robust optimization methods to ensure that each constructed route is feasible for all realizations of the uncertain parameters that lie in a predetermined uncertainty set. We present a tractable robust optimization formulation with a coaxial box uncertainty set due to its advantages in handling uncertainty in our selective assessment routing problem, in which the dimension of the uncertainty (number of arcs traversed) is implicitly determined. To solve the proposed model efficiently, we develop a practical method for evaluating route feasibility with respect to the robust route duration constraints, and embed this feasibility check procedure in a tabu search heuristic. We present computational results to evaluate the effectiveness of our solution method, and illustrate our approach on a case study based on a real-world post-disaster network.}

The SVPP consists of determining a new weekly plan for sailing the platform supply vessels whenever the sailing plan needs revising due to some major events, such as the arrival or removal of drilling rigs, and demand increase or reduction in the current platforms. Apart from remaining cost-efficient, the new weekly plan is required to be persistent, i.e., exhibiting few changes from the previous plan. To achieve this, we propose a bi-objective optimization framework that enables the planners to simultaneously take into account both costs and persistence-related objectives. The framework encompasses a bi-objective SVPP model and a genetic search algorithm adapted from Borthen et al. (2018). We show that the proposed algorithm is able to provide high-quality solutions in reasonable time and has the decision support capability in real offshore operation planning.}

The review systematizes the current socio-technical debate on civil drones for transportation purposes allowing for a (critical) interim assessment.

A total of 2581 relevant quotations were subdivided into anticipated barriers (426), potential problems (1037), proposed solutions (737) and expected benefits (381). We found that the debate is characterized by predominantly technical and regulatory problems and barriers which are considered to prevent or impede the use of drones for parcel and passengers transportation. At the same time, definite economic expectations are juxtaposed with quite complex and differentiated concerns regarding societal and environmental impacts. Scrutinizing the most prevalent transportation-related promises of traffic reduction, travel time saving and environmental relief we found that there is a strong need to provide scientific evidence for the promises linked to the use of drones for transportation. We conclude that the debate on drones for transportation needs further qualification, emphasizing societal benefits and public involvement more strongly.}

A well-planned medical response, although just one component of the disaster management process, plays a vital role in reducing mortality and morbidity. In this study, we propose a new modeling framework to optimize the selection and establishment of temporary health facilities in an area struck by a significant earthquake, and to allocate healthcare professionals, such as doctors, who can provide in-person and virtual care to the victims. The objective of the model is to minimize the total unsatisfied healthcare demand. The framework is particularly useful in low-income countries, where natural disasters quickly deplete medical and social resources. The application of the model is numerically illustrated using data from the 2005 Kashmir Earthquake in Pakistan. The results obtained are presented and discussed in the paper.}

abstract = {Pre-positioning of relief supplies is one important preparedness action for natural disasters. This paper proposes the importance of supplier selection in humanitarian relief, and integrates it into the pre-positioning strategy. These suppliers have own physical inventories for regular business, and relief agencies are assumed to be able to use such inventories for disaster response by providing compensation. The supplier selection criteria include price discounts offered by suppliers based on order quantity and required lead time as well as physical inventory. By considering disruption risks, this paper presents a two-stage stochastic programming model to produce plans including facility location and inventory, supplier selection, and distribution of relief supplies. A case study focused on hurricane threats in the Gulf Coast area of the US illustrates the application of the proposed model. Sensitivity analysis of comparison experiments offers managerial insights for relief agencies.}

abstract = {In recent years the maritime freight transport has rapidly increased, causing congestion in many port areas. In some cases, in order to improve the capacity and the reliability of the temporary storage, a solution, recommended by industry officials, is the expansion of the terminal capacity. When this solution is not available, the ‘dry port’ area represents an effective alternative. The adoption of a dry port, if on one hand leads to benefits on terminal congestion, on the other hand requires resources and investments due to the transport of the container from port to dry port and vice versa. In the evaluation of the strategy to be adopted different aspects shall be evaluated to estimate time required for the container handling inside and outside the terminal on the basis of the congestion degree. In this paper, to support decision makers in identifying the best strategy to be adopted, a mathematical model allowing to identify the number of containers to be stocked in port and/or in dry port is defined considering the intra-/inter-terminal handling of the containers, in order to minimize the overall running costs and of the carbon footprint. The model, based on a computational algorithm for non-linear programming, is able to provide the number of containers to be stocked in port and/or in dry port, ensuring an effective strategy dependent on ‘road’ and ‘non-road' material handling equipment adopted, on the number and size of containers, as well as on the distance from port to dry port. Results obtained from numerical experiments show that, on the basis of the running cost and the carbon footprint of the container handling activities, it is possible to identify the most economic and eco-friendly container handling configuration. The case study of the Port of Bari (Italy) is investigated. In this case, given the overall number of containers to be stocked and the distance between port and dry port, the solutions found by the model identify a configuration able to ensure a reduction of 7% and 11% of the running cost and of the carbon footprint, respectively, when compared to the configuration in which all containers are stored in the port.}

abstract = {Urbanization is an established trend worldwide. It generates negative consequences in urban areas threatening their sustainability and future. In this context, cities are utilizing their underground space at an accelerating rate. However, usually underground alternatives are only considered as a last resort. At the same time, the underground space is considered to have zero value and is not included in city planning. In order to resolve this situation the estimation of the underground space is necessitated. The present paper attempts to contribute to this issue by proposing an integrated methodology that estimates not only the market price but also the environmental benefits in monetary terms. The proposed methodology combines elements from the real-estate appraisal methodology and environmental economics in order to provide an estimate of the value of the underground space. The methodology was implemented to estimate the value of the underground space in the case of underground storage facilities in Athens, Greece. The results indicate that underground space has significant value and one third of its value is attributed to the monetized environmental benefits of the underground space. In general, the methodology is versatile and can be adapted to meet various needs and land-uses. Furthermore, it can be an effective tool in the hands of city planners, city authorities and other stakeholders leading to integrated city planning without neglecting the underground space and improved long-term management of the underground space.}

Two steelmaking plants are the anchor tenants of the network comprising a cement manufacturer, a thermoelectric generation plant, a lead ingots manufacturer, a zinc ingots manufacturer and refractory liner manufacturer, totaling eight relationships. The companies mutually exchange approximately 300,000 tons of by-products per year, comprising coal ash, mill scale, electric arc furnace dust, steam, zinc sludge, lead sludge, and refractory lining leftover, totaling eight dyadic or triadic relationships. The results of the study show that in three relationships, economic barriers exist (excessive processing or logistic cost). In four, internal barriers exist (risk of discontinuity and lack of research). In five, a technical barrier exists, the imbalance between generation and consumption. In seven, the drivers are cost reduction, new products or sources of revenue, and legal requirements. Environmental drivers (increasing the life of deposits or landfills) are present in five relationships. As for the structure, three relationships are one-way, whereas five are closed-loop, that is, involving direct and reverse transfers among partners.}

Since the maintenance provider is typically not the owner of a wind farm, it needs to adhere minimum service requirements that specify the required service. We consider three of such settings: (1) perform all maintenance tasks, (2) allow for a fraction of unscheduled tasks, and (3) incentivize to perform maintenance rather quickly. We provide a two-stage stochastic mixed integer programming model for the three SMFTPO settings, and solve it by means of Sample Average Approximation. In addition, we provide an overview of the, what we discovered, non-aligned modeling assumptions in the literature regarding operational decisions. By providing a series of special cases of the second-stage problem resembling the different modeling assumptions, we aim to establish a common consensus regarding the key modeling decisions to be taken in maintenance planning problems for offshore wind farms. We provide newly constructed, and publicly available, benchmark sets. We extensively compare the different SMFTPO settings and its special cases on those benchmark sets, and we show that the special case reformulations are very effective for solving the second-stage problems. In addition, we find that for particular cases, established modeling techniques result in overestimations and increased running times.}

Floriculture is an important employer, and earner of foreign exchange for several regions of central/southern and eastern Africa including more recently Ethiopia. Air transportation often plays a critical role when the supply-chain involves high-value, non-durable, relatively light-weight, and compact consignments such as flowers, and geographically when regions are difficult to access by other trunk modes. The success of air cargo chains, however, depend as much on the quality of surface modes serving various “last mile” access and egress functions, as well as efficient nodal interchange points and the availability of suitable airport and airline capacity. The last, because of the important role of belly-hold space, includes consideration of passenger as well as cargo specific services. To meet the needs of Africa's floriculture sector, a variety of supply-chain models have emerged that embrace air and surface links, as well as storage at various points in the chain. The paper considers the nature of these chains, the reason d'être for their structures, and their limitations.}

This study focuses on UFT policy choice by local authorities, investigating how policy context, resource availability and the need for legitimacy influence how local authorities seek and select UFT specific policies. The methodology is a cross-case analysis of eleven cities across three countries (Sweden, England and Scotland), based on interview and documentary data. Findings reveal that all cities have the same high-level goals, such as reducing emissions and congestion, supporting the economy and improving quality of life. However, in most cases these rather general goals are not broken down into clear objectives with targets that can be measured. Therefore, selected UFT policy measures are chosen from a pool of common measures (primarily access restrictions such as time windows and weight restrictions), but without monitored targets that determine whether or not they are achieving objectives. This does not necessarily mean that the measures chosen are inappropriate, but that there is a lack of a strategic approach to setting and reviewing measures according to achieving specific policy goals. This is primarily a result of a lack of resources and dedicated UFT personnel, as well as challenges related to public acceptability of restrictive policies.}

Therefore, decision-makers have been concerned with ways of providing relief to reduce the losses. Here, we present a multi-objective bi-level model for disaster location-routing problem that provides the needed supplies through multiple suppliers, considering the supply risk. Moreover, to reduce the risk and increase efficiency, special attention is given to people's help for supplying goods having high priority and low risk. At the first level of the model, the cost and time objectives are considered, and at the second level, the risk and efficiency objectives are considered. To solve the bi-level model, first we solved the follower's perspective model using the augmented epsilon constraint method to convert the second level objectives to a single-objective. Then, using the KKT conditions, the bi-level model is converted to a linear single-level bi-objective model, which is solved by the augmented epsilon constraint method. To validate the model, the suburb of Sari in Iran is selected as a case study and the model is solved by the CPLEX/GAMS. The results show that the lower-risk goods with higher priorities should be supplied by public donations to increase efficiency in provision of relief. The results of sensitivity analysis demonstrate that commodities are not supplied merely by public donations, because if the inventories of Red Cross and Red Crescent decrease, or level of demand rises, exogenous suppliers and/or general public donations can provide goods.}

The objective is to maximize the profits generated for the completed services. The previous deterministic and stochastic approaches used heuristic procedures and approximations for solving large-scale instances of this problem. This paper proposes a Branch-and-Price method which is the first tailored exact solution approach for the VAP. This method provides proven optimal solutions within reasonable computational times, even for large-scale problem instances, and it is based on reformulating a compact Integer Linear Programming model of the VAP through the Dantzig–Wolfe decomposition and using efficient procedures for solving each component of the reformulation. The Primal–Dual Column Generation Method (PDCGM) is used to solve the master problem, while the subproblem is modeled as a Maximum Cost Flow Problem and is solved using the aggregation of the optimal longest paths on Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG). Finally, we use three branching procedures (branching on a set of arcs, on the original variables and on the demand constraints) to obtain the optimal integer solution of the VAP. Computational experiments with 30 instances from a case study and 200 random realistic-sized instances are presented and analyzed, which show that the method has superior performance with respect to other exact approaches in solving large-scale VAP instances.}

In particular fleets of electric vehicles are seen as an efficient ecologic and economic transportation alternative for operating last-mile goods distribution in cities. This paper deals with the use of electric modules which can be added or removed from a freight vehicle to help gain capacity or respect delays when delivering customers. Since the electric vehicles have a limited battery capacity, they have to stop and recharge them at dedicated stations during the delivery tours. However, with the modular feature, this problem of disturbing the whole distribution process for recharging the batteries can be reduced and sometimes overlooked. This paper objective is to design and find the optimal routing strategy for a fleet of electric modular vehicles operating the last-mile delivery, with the minimal cost including the acquisition, the travel and the recharging ones. The research problem arising from the structure of the fleet can be associated with both a truck and trailer problem and a fleet size and mix vehicle routing problem with time windows using electric vehicles. This problem is presented in the first part of the article with the proposed solving procedure. More precisely, for big instances of the problem which is NP-Hard, a Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) is designed and adapted. Experimental studies carried out on some benchmark instances show that the VNS performs impressively well in comparison with the best solving approaches of the literature.}

Through computational studies, we investigate the impacts of empty container repositioning cost and information asymmetry on the system performances. The numerical experiments reveal that (1) if the market demand is likely to be high, the ocean carrier is more eager to procure private information so as to prevent profit loss from information asymmetry; (2) the degree of information asymmetry has different impacts on the empty container repositioning cost in different transportation directions.}

abstract = {Managing the distribution of fuel in theater requires Army fuel planners to forecast demand at the strategic level to ensure that fuel will be in the right place, at the right time, and in the amounts needed. This work presents a simulation approach to forecasting that accounts for the structure of the supply chain network when aggregating the demand of war fighters across the theater over the forecasting horizon. The resulting empirical distribution of demand at the theater entry point enables planners to identify forecast characteristics that impact their planning process, including the amplitudes and temporal positions of peaks in demand, and the estimated lead time to the point of use. Experimentation indicates that the forecasts are sensitive to the pattern of war fighter demand, the precise structure of the in-theater supply chain network, and the constraints and uncertainty present in the network, all of which are critical planning considerations.}

abstract = {Background
The Blood Donation Service West serves North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), Rhineland-Palatinate (RP), and Saarland, an area of 56,500 km2. In addition to routine red blood cell concentrates, plasma, and platelets, special products are provided. Since 2014, this has included autologous serum eye drops (ASED) for topical use in patients suffering from different illnesses accompanied by dry eye disease.
Methods
A volume of 250–525 mL of patient blood was collected into an anticoagulant-free blood bag. Laboratory testing included Hepatitis B/C-, HIV 1/2-, and Lues-serology. Coagulation and centrifugation were followed by leukoreduction. Single-use vials were obtained by filling mini-bag systems using a sterile tube welder. Storage at ≤−20 °C enabled a shelf-life of up to 6 months and 30 days at 4 °C after thawing for shipment.
Results
Contracts were closed with 15 ophthalmology clinics and medical practices in NRW and RP to supply patients with ASED. The patient pool increased from 19 in 2014 to 46 in 2020, with an average age of 43–55 years. Overall, blood collections almost tripled from 31 to 100 per year, increasing the stock of deliverable single-use vials from 3328 to 13,358. Delivery in a liquid state allowed engagement of 44 pharmacies located in the patient neighborhoods for continuous supply.
Conclusion
Manufacturing in a closed bag system allowed integration into blood bank operations. However, cost-coverage by health insurance remained a case-by-case decision. Allogeneic application as ‘just-another-blood-product’ could be an aspiration. Yet, conclusive data from large clinical trials are needed for licensed provision in Germany.}

abstract = {The opening of public shelters to provide evacuees with access to safety and welfare is a typical response to large-scale emergencies. In some countries, officials allocate people at risk to shelters based on the location of their residence or workplace and this advice is communicated to them in advance of an evacuation so they get to shelters quickly whilst avoiding overcrowding and associated secondary risks in the shelter. When an evacuation is called, some evacuees follow this advice and attend their allocated public shelter but others disregard the advice and select an alternative public shelter (e.g. the most convenient or nearest one) or go to a private shelter (e.g. a hotel or house of friends or family). Using data from Pittsburgh (Pennsylvania, USA), supplemented with data from interviews with 142 emergency officials from 10 countries, this paper explores how evacuee behaviour matters when planning public shelters. Our novel contribution is a model-based integer programming simulation analysis of public shelters from the combined effect of three evacuee behaviours: comply with official advice and attend their allocated public shelter; attend the nearest public shelter; attend a public shelter of personal preference. Sensitivity analyses identifies the importance of these behaviours on the time to evacuate the city, finding that if evacuees disregard the official allocation then widespread over-occupation of public shelters can result which significantly increases the time to evacuate. This paper discusses OR modelling issues and the implications of these results for disaster preparedness, evacuee behaviour and emergency response.}

abstract = {This empirical research improves the understanding of landside congestion factors in bulk cargo port terminals. It presents a model for identifying factors and interactions contributing to congestion severity. Ports play critical roles at the intersection of multiple independent supply chains and have an enormous potential to improve supply chains' competitiveness. However, this point of intersection for supply chains also creates significant coordination challenges best exemplified by the presence of landside congestion. Although landside congestion is an issue that plagues many ports and terminals, research on congestion remains limited, especially in bulk cargo port terminals. This lack of research may also partially explain the dominance of market-based mechanisms for managing congestion. Importantly, market-based approaches often fail or shift congestion to other parts of the supply chain because they are not aligned with the causal factors and their interactions that contribute to congestion. This paper analyses three case studies. Each case centres on an Australian bulk cargo port terminal for forest products and its associated landside supply chain. The research findings identify social, technical and behavioral factors and their different types of interactions at the terminal and related supply chains and reveal how these factors contribute to the appearance and severity of landside congestion. Based on these findings, the paper presents a new definition of landside congestion and a model for identifying and understanding interactions among congestion factors. Improved knowledge of landside congestion can refine congestion management through contextually tailored solutions depending on the factors’ presence and interactions.}

In this study, a collaborative truck-and-drone system was developed as a post-disaster assessment tool for use by humanitarian relief networks. The proposed system comprises a drone equipped with a camera that can launch from a truck to collect information from both nodes and links of a post-disaster transportation network. Following drone operation, the truck is used to retrieve and recharge the drone’s battery. To optimize this collaborative truck-and-drone system, we focused on the routing problem with the objective of maximizing the value of information collected from nodes and links within a predefined time limit, a problem made challenging by the need to determine the routes of the truck and drone in an integrated manner. To the best of our knowledge, this study was the first to consider the problem of collaborative truck-and-drone routing optimization with the goal of profit maximization. After formulating the proposed problem as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model, we decomposed the problem structure into a path-based master problem and two sub-problems to allow the use of a column generation (CG) framework to tackle the problem. Numerical experiments were conducted to examine the proposed model and algorithm at various instance sizes that were generated by modifying an existing benchmark, with the results indicating that the proposed algorithm can obtain high-quality solutions with optimality gaps of less than 10% for all terminated instances within predefined time limit. A real-world instance—the Kartal district of Istanbul—was then used to demonstrate the practicality of the proposed model. Finally, the results of the numerical analysis were used to develop managerial insights for application by humanitarian relief agencies.}

We mathematically formulate the problem, and develop a hyper-heuristic (HH-ILS) algorithm based on iterative local search and variable neighborhood descent heuristics to effectively solve the problem. Extensive computational experiments are conducted to analyze the impact of the G-VRPSPD and the HH-ILS. We investigate the effect of green objective function on total fuel consumption cost by comparing the G-VRPSPD with the VRPSPD. We perform comparative analysis to investigate the performance of HH-ILS. We also conduct sensitivity analysis to investigate the performance of neighborhood structures, hyper heuristic and local search. The results show that the green objective function has a significant effect on total fuel consumption cost. The HH-ILS algorithm yields competitive results when compared with the mathematical formulation and the state-of-the-art heuristics in the literature.}

Extreme prematurity is associated with high mortality rates. The probability of death at different points in time is a priority for professionals and parents, and needs to be established on an individual basis. The aim of this study is to carry out a systematic review of predictive models of mortality in premature infants that have been published recently.
Methods
A double search was performed for article published in PubMed on models predicting mortality in premature neonates. The population studied were premature neonates with a gestational age of ≤30 weeks and/or a weight at birth of ≤1500g. Works published with new models from June 2010 to July 2019 after a systematic review by Medlock (2011) were included. An assessment was made of the population, characteristics of the model, variables used, measurements of functioning, and validation.
Results
Of the 7744 references (1st search) and 1435 (2nd search) found, 31 works were selected, with 8 new models finally being included. Five models (62.5%) were developed in North America and 2 (25%) in Europe. A sequential model (Ambalavanan) enables predictions of mortality to be made at birth, 7, 28 days of life, and 36 weeks post-menstrual. A multiple logistic regression analysis was performed on 87.5% of the models. The population discrimination was measured using odds ratio (75%) and the area under the curve (50%). “internal validation” had been carried out on 5 models. Three models can be accessed on-line. There are no predictive models validated in Spain.
Conclusions
The making of decisions based on predictive models can lead to the care given to the premature infant being more individualised and with a better use of resources. Predictive models of mortality in premature neonates in Spain need to be developed.

Shorter travelling distance and less fuel consumption would logically lead to lower emissions of greenhouse gases or particulate matters, thus relieve environmental burdens. In this regard, an appropriate selection of the logistic sequence may contribute significantly to the environment. The logistic sequence for pickup and delivery services are often determined based on decision makers' experience and intuitive judgements. While life cycle assessment (LCA), a well-versed approach, can be used for quantifying the environmental loads, it is often regarded as not suitable for making routine decisions because it takes significant time and resources for data collection as well as expert knowledge for result interpretation. Additionally, the results of LCA studies focus mainly on the environmental perspective and that other decision criteria cannot be taken into account in a single evaluation process. This paper attempts to develop a practical and objective tool, by combining a simplified LCA with the ant colony optimization algorithm, that supports evaluating several decision criteria simultaneously and determining the optimal or near optimal sequence for vehicle routing on pickup and delivery activities. This fit-for-purpose approach enables decision makers to pay attention to environmental impacts during the determination of the travelling sequences. The proposed approach has been successfully performed to identify the optimal solution through benchmarking against other possible sequences, with the aim to reducing environmental impact while balancing other decision criteria.}

Previous rescue models address the efficiency issue primarily by minimizing the total travel time, while not taking into account other significant factors in the rescue process, such as the number of affected people and the degree of building damage. To overcome these shortcomings, this paper aims to solve the rescue routing problem by maximizing the arc-based rescue efficiency, which is redefined as the ratio between the primary rescue input and output factors to represent the efficiency of the rescue operations. Therefore, a systematic methodology is proposed to decompose the original rescue routing problem into two decision making phases. First, an extended data envelopment analysis (DEA) model is constructed to evaluate the rescue efficiency along each arc. Specifically, a group decision constraint cone, which refers to the combined output of a group decision from experts, is constructed to distinguish the features and rescue focus of each disaster. Second, an efficiency-based routing model is developed to determine a feasible rescue tour for the entire transportation network, thus achieving the goal of maximizing the total rescue efficiency. An empirical example of a real earthquake disaster in Wenchuan, China, is provided to demonstrate the novelty and practical capabilities of the proposed approach in post-disaster emergency rescue operations. Finally, a comparison analysis is conducted with the traditional time-oriented routing method, and the results show that the method proposed in this study can improve the rescue performance by 21.2%.}

The data that is collected from the vehicles and drivers are generally not fully utilized to its full potential other than day-to-day business activities because of the difficulties created by the big data aspects of the logistic data in storing, processing, analyzing, and reporting which require expertise and infrastructure. Real-time analysis of the data coming from VTS and mobile devices provides enormous value in terms of businesses. In this research, by using real-world data supplied by an international logistic company, we have established a multimodel streaming analytic framework that detects trajectory anomalies and identifies drivers in parallel and near-real-time. The framework can be enhanced with any number of trajectory or driver identification models, all of which can be run in parallel and contribute to the overall anomaly detection process by the “consensus” of the included models. In this study, we provide a sample implementation of the framework with one trajectory and one behavior anomaly detection model suitable for logistic spatio-temporal datastream. Provided models do not require any business-specific data and only depend on the basic VTS and location data. An isolation-based model is used for trajectory anomaly detection which does not need the source and the destination while identifying sub-trajectories. The outputs of both models are combined on a dashboard which shows the vehicles’ abnormal sub-trajectories along with the notification of whether or not the vehicles are being driven by the assigned driver.}

The relationship between the participants of the transportation process of initial conditions for reform should be composed on the basis of non-discriminatory access to infrastructure resources.}

While urban commercial vehicles are known to travel longer distances and to stop more frequently than passenger vehicles, little is known about their parking cruising behavior, nor how parking infrastructure affect such behavior. In this study we propose a simple method to quantitively explore the parking cruising behavior of commercial vehicle drivers in urban areas using widely available GPS data, and how urban transport infrastructure impacts parking cruising times. We apply the method to a sample of 2900 trips performed by a fleet of commercial vehicles, delivering and picking up parcels in Seattle downtown. We obtain an average estimated parking cruising time of 2.3 min per trip, contributing on average for 28 percent of total trip time. We also found that cruising for parking decreased as more curb-space was allocated to commercial vehicles load zones and paid parking and as more off-street parking areas were available at trip destinations, whereas it increased as more curb space was allocated to bus zone.}

In this system, truck and UAV operations are synchronized, i.e., one or more UAVs travel on a truck, which serves as a mobile depot. Deliveries can be made by both UAVs and the truck. While the truck follows a multi-stop route, each UAV delivers a single shipment per dispatch. The presented optimization model minimizes the waiting time of customers in the system. The model determines the optimal allocation of customers to truck and UAVs, the optimal route sequence of the truck, and the optimal launch and reconvene locations of the UAVs along the truck route. We formulate the problem as a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model and conduct a bound analysis to gauge the maximum potential of the proposed system to reduce customer waiting time compared to a traditional truck-only delivery system. To be able to solve real-world problem size instances, we propose an efficient Truck and Drone Routing Algorithm (TDRA). The solution quality and computational performance of the mathematical model and the TDRA are compared together and with the truck-only model based on a variety of problem instances. Further, we apply the TDRA to a real-world case study for e-commerce delivery in São Paulo, Brazil. Our numerical results suggest significant reductions in customer waiting time to be gained from the proposed multi-modal delivery model.}

This paper proposes a set of key performance indicators to evaluate potential improvements in operational, environmental and social performances of integrated passenger and freight flows, compared to the current transport schemes. The two case studies of the Northern lagoon of Venice in Italy and the Slovenian Municipality of Velenje indicate that the model may be particularly effective in those cases where reduced freight volumes, limited freight pickup/delivery locations and a lower elasticity of the travel demand reduce the constraints to the adoption of this integrated scheme. Results call for a reduction both in distances travelled and in externalities produced, and hence a good potential in FLM terms. Beside these technical aspects, one of the main issues is the need for innovation in the normative/regulatory context: a prerequisite in order to apply this solution to real-life contexts.}

The Port of Newcastle features three coal export terminals, operating primarily in cargo assembly mode. They share a rail network on their inbound operations and a channel on their outbound operations. Maximizing throughput at a single coal terminal, taking into account its layout, equipment and operating policies, is already a challenging problem. However, maximizing throughput of the Hunter Valley coal export system as a whole requires that terminals and inbound/outbound shared resources be considered simultaneously. Existing approaches to solve this and similar problems either lack realism or are computationally too demanding to be useful as an everyday planning tool. We present a parallel genetic algorithm to optimize the integrated system. The algorithm models activities in continuous time and can handle practical planning horizons efficiently. The solutions are on average 17% better than those obtained with the current state-of-the-art method – a constraint programming-based approach – requiring less than 3% of the CPU time. Tests were conducted on 10 instances generated using real world data, with 200 vessels and approximately 270 stockpiles each.}

abstract = {Background
Limited data on clinical implementation of oral immunotherapy (OIT) have been reported with incomplete evaluation of barriers.
Objective
To survey Canadian allergists on their current practice of OIT and barriers to implementation and expansion of OIT.
Methods
A survey investigating current practice and logistical and clinical barriers to offering or expanding OIT was distributed to all Canadian Society of Allergy and Clinical Immunology allergists.
Results
Of 90 responding allergists, 52.2% reported offering OIT, most commonly to peanut. Food sublingual immunotherapy was offered by 7% of allergists. Having received training for OIT was associated with currently performing OIT (P = .008); 44.7% of allergists offering OIT had received training on OIT, and 81.4% not offering OIT had no training. A total of 87% of allergists performing OIT reported lack of efficacy data and lack of support staff and clinic space, and concerns about increased oral challenges (84%) were “moderately” to “extremely” important barriers to expanding OIT. For clinicians not offering OIT, concerns about safety (95%), after-hours support (95%), efficacy (93%), medicolegal risk (93%), and long-term practice implications (93%) were prioritized as significant barriers. Qualitative assessment suggested concerns about the practical challenges associated with OIT, the need for increased safety and efficacy data, and a desire for OIT guidelines and training.
Conclusion
The implementation of OIT faces many barriers, both clinical and logistical. Increasing high-quality safety and efficacy data may support those hesitant to offer OIT, and improving funding may address the practical infrastructure challenges. In addition, training will help expand access for allergists interested in performing OIT.}

abstract = {In this work, an emission-minimizing vehicle routing problem with heterogeneous vehicles and a heterogeneous road and traffic network is considered as it is typical in urban areas. Depending on the load of the vehicle, there exist multiple emission-minimal arcs for traveling between two locations. To solve the vehicle routing problem efficiently, a column generation approach is presented. At the core of the procedure an emission-oriented elementary shortest path problem on a multigraph is solved by a backward labeling algorithm. It is shown that the labeling algorithm can be sped up by adjusting the dual master program and by restricting the number of labels propagated in the sub-problem. The column generation technique is used to setup a fast heuristic as well as a branch-and-price algorithm. Both procedures are evaluated based on test instances with up to 100 customers. It turns out that the heuristic approach is very effective and generates near-optimal solutions with gaps below 0.1% on average while only requiring a fraction of the runtime of the exact approach.}

While these city-level factors help to improve the quality of distance approximation functions for city-wide vehicle movements, more granular factors are needed to obtain accurate shortest path distance approximations for last-mile transportation systems that are typically characterized by local trips. More importantly, local circuity factors encode valuable information about the efficiency and complexity of the urban road network, which can be leveraged to inform policy and practice. In this paper, we quantify and analyze local network circuity leveraging contemporary traffic datasets. Using the city of São Paulo as our primary case study and a combination of supervised and un-supervised machine learning methods, we observe significant heterogeneities in local network circuity, explained by dimensional and topological properties of the road network. Locally, real trip distances are about twice as long as distances predicted by the L1 norm. Results from São Paulo are compared to seven additional urban areas in Latin America and the United States. At a coarse-grained level of analysis, we observe similar correlations between road network properties and local circuity across these cities.}

Companies are offering faster delivery services, deploying collection-and-delivery points and multi-echelon distribution networks with a range of facility types, diversifying last-mile transportation modes with new types of vehicles and contracting third-party and crowd-sourcing-based transportation. In this paper, we propose an integrated modeling framework for strategic last-mile design of three-tiered multi-modal networks in omni-channel environment, with customer demand differentiated according to multiple time-differentiated delivery services and multiple product-exchange alternatives. In order to apply this framework in a large-scale demand setting and capture the granularity of customer demand and distribution network features, we extend the route cost estimation formulae from the literature and incorporate them in a three-echelon capacitated location-routing problem that optimizes the configuration of distribution networks in an integrated way. Through a number of numerical experiments, we show the impact of the diversified customer demand and the novel distribution network features on the overall network performance and demonstrate the economic benefit of an integrated approach. A real-world case study, inspired by the ongoing operations of a major omni-channel retailer in São Paulo, Brazil, serves to illustrate the real-world impact of our work.}

In this paper, we assume that relief distribution activities are hampered due to damaged roads, which can be restored by repair teams using restoration equipment. We propose a two-stage stochastic programming model integrating facility location and network restoration decisions. Our integrated model decides on the location of restoration equipment prior to the disaster in addition to the facility location decisions. Moreover, decisions related to relief item distribution and network restoration are made jointly after the disaster for each disaster scenario. We capture uncertainty in the network availability by incorporating the repair times required to restore the damaged roads. To solve our integrated model efficiently, we develop a sample average approximation method with concentration sets motivated by Rosing and ReVelle’s (1997) Heuristic Concentration. These concentration sets are comprised of promising locations identified by information obtained from disaster scenarios. We limit our solution space in the first stage to concentration sets to reduce the problem size without sacrificing the solution quality significantly. Our computational results show significant improvement in unmet demand and cost measures by integrating location and network restoration models.}

Prior literature has studied how to control vehicle fleet in queueing-networks to rebalance excess supply or demand in OTS. This aggregated setting models the stochastic demand process and decompose large-scale networks for which product-form equilibrium distributions exist. However, such an approach is unsatisfactory in terms of computational complexity for its dependence on vehicle numbers. This paper presents a stochastic conic programming approach that obtains the near-optimal vehicle repositioning controls with endogenous demand with mild computational complexity and high fidelity. This global framework covers most existing queueing-network-based OTS models in the literature. Leveraging this approach, we explore day-to-day vehicle repositioning problems for on-demand vehicle operations in New York City. These results support the potential for providing a more accessible and sustainable on-demand mobility service, which is of particular significance as multimodal transport continues to emerge.}

However, CDPs have only recently been introduced in New Zealand, and service providers are trialling with a few CDPs established in larger cities, such as Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch. Selection of CDP locations on an ad-hoc basis is likely to be expensive for service providers and the adopted location configuration may not be able to attract the desired consumer patronage. Thus, selection of locations and the density of CDPs needs to be done on the basis of considering factors, such as consumers’ distribution pattern and accessibility to potential CDP locations. This study aimed to identify the optimal density and locations for establishing CDPs, using Christchurch as a case study. A set-covering problem approach to locating facilities was adopted, taking city demographics and travel distances between population centres and potential facility locations into consideration. Non-conventional CDPs, such as dairies and supermarkets were found to be more accessible, and thus may well prove to be efficient for locating CDPs than traditional post shops. The results also suggest the spatial location of facilities forming an optimal configuration of CDPs.}
