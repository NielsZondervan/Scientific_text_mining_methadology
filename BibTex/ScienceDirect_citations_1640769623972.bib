Introducción
Los episodios de obstrucción bronquial a temprana edad constituyen un problema frecuente en pediatría. El objetivo de este estudio, además de conocer la prevalencia de sibilancias recurrentes en lactantes de Buenos Aires, fue identificar los factores asociados.
Métodos
Estudio de tipo transversal realizado durante 2011 y 2012, en el Hospital de Niños Ricardo Gutiérrez, Buenos Aires, como parte del Estudio Internacional de Sibilancias en Lactantes, mediante una encuesta validada para padres de lactantes de 12 a 15 meses. Se evaluó la prevalencia de sibilancias, fundamentalmente de tipo recurrentes (tres o más episodios) y los posibles factores asociados. El análisis estadístico se realizó por prueba de χ2, prueba de Fisher y análisis de regresión logística univariada y multivariada. El nivel de significación fue de 0.05.
Resultados
De 1063 lactantes, el 58.9% (intervalo de confianza (IC) 95% 55.9-61.9) presentaron al menos un episodio de sibilancia y el 26.3% (IC 95% 23.8-29.9), tres o más episodios (sibilancias recurrentes). Los factores vinculados a padecer al menos un episodio de sibilancia fueron el sexo masculino (p=0.001), seis o más resfríos en el primer año (p <0.0001), edad del primer resfrío <4 meses (p <0.0001), neumonía (p <0.0001), tabaquismo durante el embarazo (p=0.01). Los factores relacionados con sibilancias recurrentes fueron seis o más resfríos en el primer año de vida (p <0.0001), tener el primer episodio de sibilancia antes del cuarto mes de vida (p <0.0001) y sibilancias nocturnas (p <0.0001).
Conclusiones
La prevalencia de sibilancias recurrentes en Buenos Aires es alta (26.3%). Algunos de los factores asociados serían prevenibles.
Background
The episodes of bronchial obstruction at early age constitute a frequent problem in Pediatrics. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of recurrent wheezing in infants in Buenos Aires City, as well as to identify any associated factors.
Methods
Cross-sectional study performed from 2011 to 2012 in the Children Hospital Ricardo Gutiérrez, Buenos Aires City, as part of the International Study of Wheezing in Infants. A validated questionnaire was applied to parents of infants aged between 12 and 15 months. The prevalence of wheezing, mostly the recurrent episodes (three or more), and their probable associated factors were evaluated. Data were statistically analyzed with χ2, Fisher's test, binary and logistics multiple regression analysis. The significance level was 0.05.
Results
Over 1063 infants, 58.9% (confidence interval (CI) 95% 55.9-61.9) presented at least one episode of wheezing and 26.3% (CI95% 23.8-29.9) three or more episodes (recurrent wheezing). Risk factors associated to wheezing were male gender (p=0.001), six or more episodes of cold during the first year of life (p <0.0001), age at first cold <4 months (p <0.0001); pneumonia (p <0.0001) and smoking during pregnancy (tobacco) (p=0.01). For recurrent wheezing, risk factors we considered as six or more episodes of cold during the first year of life (p <0.0001), early (< 4 month of age) onset wheezing (p <0.0001) and nocturnal wheezing (p <0.0001).
Conclusions
The prevalence of recurrent wheezing among infants in Buenos Aires Ciy was high (26.3%). Some identified associated factors can be preventable.}

abstract = {Background: CAR-T cell therapy directed against the CD19 antigen is a breakthrough treatment for patients (pts) with relapsed/refractory (R/R) B-cell NHL. Despite impressive outcomes, not all pts respond and many that respond still relapse. Affordability and accessibility are further considerations that limit current commercial models of CAR-T products. Commercial CAR-T manufacturing is complex, time consuming, and expensive with a supply chain starting at the treating center with apheresis of mononuclear cells, cryopreservation, and shipping to and from a centralized third-party manufacturing site. We addressed these limitations in a Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating a first-in-human bispecific tandem CAR-T cell directed against both CD19 and CD20 (CAR-20.19-T) antigens for pts with R/R B-cell NHL. Through dual targeting we hope to improve response rates and durability of response while limiting antigen escape. We eliminated third party shipping logistics utilizing the CliniMACS Prodigy, a compact tabletop device that allows for automated manufacturing of CAR-T cells within a GMP compliant environment within the hospital. Most materials and reagents used to produce the CAR-T cell product were single-sourced from the device manufacturer. Methods: Phase 1 (NCT03019055), single center, dose escalation + expansion study to demonstrate feasibility and safety of locally manufactured second generation 41BB + CD3z CAR-20.19-T cells via the CliniMACS Prodigy. Feasibility was measured by ability to generate a target CAR-20.19-T cell dose for a minimum of 75% of subjects. Safety was assessed by the presence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) through 28 days post-infusion. Dose was escalated in a 3+3 fashion with a starting dose of 2.5 x 10^5 cells/kg, a target DLT rate <33%, and a goal treatment dose of 2.5 x 10^6 cells/kg. Adults with R/R Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL), Follicular Lymphoma (FL), Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) or Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) were eligible. CAR-T production was set for a 14-day manufacturing process. Day 8 in-process testing was performed to ensure quality and suitability of CAR-T cells for a potential fresh infusion. On Day 10, pts eligible for a fresh CAR-T infusion initiated lymphodepletion (LDP) chemotherapy with fludarabine 30 mg/m2 x 3 days and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 x 1 day, and cells were administered after harvest on Day 14. Pts ineligible for fresh infusion received cryopreserved product and LDP was delayed accordingly. Results: 6 pts have been enrolled and treated with CAR-20.19-T cells: 3 pts at 2.5 x 10^5 cells/kg and 3 pts at 7.5 x 10^5 cells/kg. Median age was 53 years (48-62). Underlying disease was MCL in 3 pts, DLBCL in 2 pts, and CLL in 1 patient. Baseline data and prior treatments are listed in Table 1. CAR-T production was successful in all runs and all pts received their target dose. Three pts received fresh CAR-T cells and 3 pts received CAR-T cells after cryopreservation. To date there are no DLTs to report. No cases of Grade 3/4 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) or neurotoxicity (NTX) were observed. One patient had Grade 2 CRS and Grade 2 NTX requiring intervention. The other had self-limited Grade 1 CRS and Grade 1 NTX. Median time to development of CRS was Day +11 post-infusion. All pts had neutrophil recovery (ANC>0.5 K/µL) by Day 28. Response at Day 28 (Table 2) is as follows: 2/6 pts achieved a complete response (CR), 2/6 achieved a partial response (PR), and 2/6 had progressive disease (PD). One subject with a PR subsequently progressed at Day 90. The 3 pts who did progress all underwent a repeat biopsy, and all retained either CD19 or CD20 positivity. Pts are currently being enrolled at the target dose (2.5 x 10^6 cells/kg) and updated results will be provided at ASH. Conclusions: Dual targeted anti-CD19 and anti-CD20 CAR-T cells were successfully produced for all pts demonstrating the feasibility of a point-of-care manufacturing process via the CliniMACS Prodigy device. With no DLTs or Grade 3-4 CRS or NTX to report, and 2/6 heavily pre-treated pts remaining in CR at 3 and 9 months respectively our approach represents a feasible and promising alternative to existing CAR-T models and costs. Down-regulation of both target antigens was not identified in any patient following CAR-T infusion, and in-process studies suggest that a shorter manufacturing timeline is appropriate for future trials (10 days).

abstract = {Accurate and timely spatial classification of crop types based on remote sensing data is important for both scientific and practical purposes. Spatially explicit crop-type information can be used to estimate crop areas for a variety of monitoring and decision-making applications such as crop insurance, land rental, supply-chain logistics, and financial market forecasting. However, there is no publically available spatially explicit in-season crop-type classification information for the U.S. Corn Belt (a landscape predominated by corn and soybean). Instead, researchers and decision-makers have to wait until four to six months after harvest to have such information from the previous year. The state-of-the-art research on crop-type classification has been shifted from relying on only spectral features of single static images to combining together spectral and time-series information. While Landsat data have a desirable spatial resolution for field-level crop-type classification, the ability to extract temporal phenology information based on Landsat data remains a challenge due to low temporal revisiting frequency and inevitable cloud contamination. To address this challenge and generate accurate, cost-effective, and in-season crop-type classification, this research uses the USDA's Common Land Units (CLUs) to aggregate spectral information for each field based on a time-series Landsat image data stack to largely overcome the cloud contamination issue while exploiting a machine learning model based on Deep Neural Network (DNN) and high-performance computing for intelligent and scalable computation of classification processes. Experiments were designed to evaluate what information is most useful for training the machine learning model for crop-type classification, and how various spatial and temporal factors affect the crop-type classification performance in order to derive timely crop type information. All experiments were conducted over Champaign County located in central Illinois, and a total of 1322 Landsat multi-temporal scenes including all the six optical spectral bands spanning from 2000 to 2015 were used. Computational experiments show the inclusion of temporal phenology information and evenly distributed spatial training samples in the study domain improves classification performance. The shortwave infrared bands show notably better performance than the widely used visible and near-infrared bands for classifying corn and soybean. In comparison with USDA's Crop Data Layer (CDL), this study found a relatively high Overall Accuracy (i.e. the number of the corrected classified fields divided by the number of the total fields) of 96% for classifying corn and soybean across all CLU fields in the Champaign County from 2000 to 2015. Furthermore, our approach achieved 95% Overall Accuracy by late July of the concurrent year for classifying corn and soybean. The findings suggest the methodology presented in this paper is promising for accurate, cost-effective, and in-season classification of field-level crop types, which may be scaled up to large geographic extents such as the U.S. Corn Belt.}

abstract = {Background: Relapse is the main cause of treatment failure after allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Based on encouraging preliminary reports for S.C. 5-Azacitidine (AZA) in the post-transplant setting, we investigated whether AZA given as maintenance might improve relapse free survival (RFS). Methods: Between 2009 and 2017, > 900 AML/MDS aged 18-75 were screened for the randomized controlled study of post-transplant AZA if they were in complete remission after SCT. The randomization was planned with the treatment arm to receive AZA given as 32 mg/m2/day S.C. for 5 days in each of 12 cycles. The control arm (Ct.) had no intervention. The first cycle of AZA was started within 42-100 post SCT. Each cycle consisted of 28 days allowing next cycle to be started within 56 days following the previous one in the presence of toxicity. The primary outcome for treatment evaluation was RFS. The goal was to test the hypothesis that AZA, given for 12 cycles, provided at least a 50% improvement compared with Ct. in median RFS. An accrual rate of 6 pts. per month was assumed. The final analysis was to be done after 213 to 246 pts. were enrolled based on the number of events observed. However, the study was closed early due to slow accrual 8 years. Results: 187 pts were randomized to either AZA (n=93) Ct. (n=94). Of 93 patients, 87 started treatment with AZA; with a median of 62 days. There were no significant differences between the arms in age (median, 57y), race, cytogenetics, donor type, conditioning intensity, hematopoietic stem cell source, except disease status in AML and comorbidity (Table 1). The majority of the pts.in AZA arm (74.6%) did not receive the planned 12 cycles of treatment, with the number of cycles varying with a median of 4 (range, 1-12). The most common causes of discontinuation of AZA were relapse/death on AZA (46.9%), hematologic/non-hematologic toxicity (26.5%), or patient request/logistical reasons (26.5%). Median follow-up time was similar between arms; 4.6 years in AZA vs. 4.06 years in Ct. Median RFS was comparable, with 2.07 yrs. (AZA) vs. 1.28 yrs. (obs.) (p=0.43). Due to bias induced by the discontinuation of AZA, any conventional comparison analysis, such as a logrank test, would be biased. Therefore, to obtain unbiased comparisons of RFS, separate landmark analysis using logrank tests were conducted, with each including only the AZA pts. who were compliant up to the landmark time, and the comparable subset of Ct. pts. defined as those at risk of failure at the landmark time (Table 2). All landmark analysis showed no significant AZA effect on RFS. A Cox model regression analysis indicated that there was improvement in RFS with AZA beyond day 180, but this was not statistically significant. Additionally, three ad hoc comparisons of AZA to Ct. were done by stratifying AZA pts. into those who received: 1-4 cycles (group 1); , 5-8 cycles (group 2) ; ,or 9-12 cycles (group 3). Pts.in.Ct. were included in the comparative analysis for group 2 if they were at risk of failure at day 150, and for group 3 at day 270. Cox regression analyses showed improvement in RFS in AZA group if they received ≥9 cycles of AZA, but the effect was not significant (p=0.18). Overall, AZA maintenance was well-tolerated with only 1 grade 5 adverse event (AE) reported with AZA vs. 10 grade 5 AEs in the Ct . arm. Twenty grade 4 AEs were reported in AZA arm, 13 were attributed to AZA; all but one was bone marrow (BM) toxicity. All AZA attributable grade IV AEs resolved with a median of 23 days. In obs. arm, 8 grade 4 AEs were reported with 3 BM toxicity. Conclusion: The SC AZA vs. observation randomized trial conducted over 8 years demonstrated that a prospective trial in the post-transplant setting was feasible and safe but challenging. In this trial, although the aim was compare RFS between arms after 12 cycles of AZA, less than 30% of AZA pts. completed the planned 12 cycles for various reasons, including disease relapse, toxicity, compliance, and logistics for receiving the drug. Because accrual was slow, the study was terminated early. While RFS was comparable between the two arms, stratification by number of cycles of AZA received showed a trend towards improvement in RFS in AZA pts. receiving more cycles of therapy. This finding supports the notion that AZA given for 9-12 cycles as maintenance therapy warrants further study for prevention of relapse after allogeneic HSCT for AML and MDS.

abstract = { Detectable MRD during chemotherapy is considered to be the most important prognostic factor in ALL. Pts with molecular failure (MolF) have a poorer overall survival (OS), inferior remission duration (RD) and poorer prognosis even after stem cell transplantation (SCT) compared to pts with molecular CR (MolCR) (Gökbuget et al, Blood 2012: 120(9): 1868). Little is known however on the outcome of pts with MRD results not fitting in the above categories e.g. MRD low positive and on the impact of additional treatments in pts with MolF. We report an expanded cohort of pts treated according to protocol 07/03 (within the trial or in GMALL registry). MRD was tested by real-time PCR of clonal TCR and Ig gene rearrangements in a reference laboratory (Kiel). The analysis refers to molecular response in ‘wk 16‘ after induction/1st consolidation and to molecular relapse (MolR) later than wk 16 (all definitions see table). The GMALL recommended referral of MolF and MolR pts to SCT in CR1. The median age of 2061 pts with Ph-neg ALL (1484 trial, N=577 registry) was 34 (16-65) yrs. Pts < 18 yrs (3%) were included until 2012 only. 90% (N=1857) achieved a CR, early death and failure rates were 5% respectively (resp). OS and RD were 60% and 64% at 5 yrs resp. 57% of the CR pts (N=1057) had an MRD test in wk 16. The rate of MRD tests increased over the yrs (2003-2009: 53% vs 2010-2016:69%; p<.0001) as prognostic relevance became more evident. 625 (59%)/1857 pts had a MolCR and196 (18%) MolF. In addition 7% were MRDneg and 16% MRDpos - both not fulfilling the criteria of MolCR or MolF (definitions see table). Results for OS at 5 yrs (MolCR vs MolF vs MRDneg vs MRDpos) were 83% vs 43% vs 78% vs 68% resp. and for RD 80% vs 38% vs 76% vs 56% resp. Differences were significant (p<.0001) for comparison of all groups, for MolCR vs MRDpos and MolCR vs MolF, but not for MolCR vs MRDneg. In 196 MolF pts OS and RD from wk16 onward was 43% and 38% at 5 yrs resp. 121 (62%) MolF pts received SCT in ongoing 1st CR. The SCT rate in MolF pts increased from 54% (2003-2009) to 72% (2010-2016)(p=.008). OS and RD for non-SCT vs SCT pts was 28% vs 53% (p<.0001) and 9% vs 56% (p<.0001) at 5 yrs resp. Out of 196 MolF pts, 19 relapsed shortly after wk 16, 2 pts were withdrawn, 1 pt died in CR and data were missing in 6 pts. Of the remaining 168 pts, 52 received immediate SCT (31%), whereas 115 pts received consolidation. Data on molecular response after the next 1-3 cycles or after SCT were available for 142 pts. In B-prec ALL (N=95) and T-ALL (N=47) the MolCR rate was 34% and 43% resp. for non-SCT approaches, whereas 75% and 71% resp. achieved a Mol CR after immediate SCT (table). However, the OS with immediate SCT vs later SCT was 34% (N=52) vs 63% (N=69) at 5 yrs resp (p=.002) and the corresp. RD was 42% vs 66% (p=.001) resp. Furthermore, pts with next consolidation leading to molCR had a superior OS (76% at 5yrs) vs those who did not (44% at 5yrs) (p=.02). A similar difference was seen for RD (60% vs 36% resp.; p=.08). In addition 102 pts with MolR during/after chemo were observed (median time to MolR: 18 mo). OS and RD from MolR onwards were 51% and 35% at 5 yrs. 38 pts were transplanted in ongoing 1st CR. OS w/o and with SCT was 37% vs 71% (p=.001) resp. with corresp. RD of 5% vs 70% (p<.0001). Results of salvage therapies in 41 pts were comparable to those in MolF (table). Important conclusions for future MRD based therapy can be drawn from this large adult ALL cohort: 1) a similar poor prognostic impact of MolF and MolR is underlined; 2) it is demonstrated that pts with any detectable MRD (MRDpos) have an intermediate prognosis and require regular follow-up MRD testing; 3) SCT offers an advantage in MolF and MolR pts, however 4) evidence was provided that later SCT (i.e. in better molecular status) could be superior to immediate SCT; 5) compliance with MRD testing and SCT in MolF increased over time; 6) many MolF pts relapsed quickly; 7) additional chemotherapy offered limited chances to achieve a MolCR, but 8) promising MolCR rates were observed for targeted therapies. For future optimisation of MRD based therapy, logistics for decisions have been implemented earlier in the GMALL trial 08 in order to avoid rapid relapses. A first stratification takes place already after induction and targeted therapies are recommended in all MolF pts before SCT.

abstract = {Introduction et objectif
Le service de la santé publique (SSP) Vaudoise se retrouve de plus en plus confronté à des ruptures d’approvisionnement de vaccins impliquant un réaménagement du programme de vaccination scolaire. Une étude pilote d’approvisionnement par une unité de logistique pharmaceutique hospitalière d’un vaccin contre la diphtérie, tétanos, coqueluche et poliomyélite (dTpa-IPV) a été effectuée. Le but était de mettre en place un système coût-efficace d’approvisionnement des vaccins scolaires dans une perspective sociétale.
Méthodologie
Tous les coûts générés par les différents modes de transports ont été pris en compte (2014–2015 vs. 2015–2016). L’incidence et les coûts de prise en charge des maladies ont été inclus dans le modèle final. Un questionnaire en ligne a également été envoyé aux infirmières des établissements scolaires afin d’obtenir des informations sur la chaîne d’approvisionnement des vaccins. Une analyse des modes de défaillances et de leurs criticités (AMDEC) sur les deux systèmes de transport (i.e. NV Logistics et la poste) ainsi que sur les conditions de stockage dans les établissements ont également été réalisée.
Résultats et discussions
Durant l’année scolaire 2015–2016, 4000 doses de vaccins dTpa-IPV ont été commandées, dont 1722 livrées et 1319 administrées. Aucune rupture de livraison n’a été enregistrée. Le détail des coûts logistiques pour le SSP ont été les suivants : – CHF 5400 de frais de transport par une entreprise certifiée BPD ; – CHF 6000 de frais logistique (CHF 1,5/doses). Par comparaison et précédemment, les fournisseurs prenaient en charge les frais d’envoi. Une continuité de la couverture vaccinale permet d’éviter des coûts supplémentaires totaux moyens par cas de diphtérie (10 cas en 2015 à CHF 68 000/cas), de tétanos (1 cas en 2015 à CHF 128 000/cas), de coqueluche (4000 cas en 2015 à CHF 1700/cas) et de poliomyélite (0 cas en 2015 à CHF 3,5 millions/cas). Le modèle pharmaceutique hospitalier évite le coût d’un risque sociétal moyen par cas, sans prise en compte d’un cas de poliomyélite, de CHF 65 000. Les AMDEC ne relèvent aucun risque notable pour le vaccin dTpa-IPV entre les deux modes d’approvisionnement même si 83,6 % des frigos ne sont pas de qualité pharmaceutique. Au total, 33 % des infirmières scolaires trouvent le système de commande via le CHUV peu pratique contre environ 10 % pour les commandes passées directement auprès du fournisseur.
Conclusion et perspective
Une unité de logistique pharmaceutique hospitalière permet d‘éviter les ruptures d’approvisionnement en réservant les doses de vaccin et garantit ainsi le maintient de la couverture vaccinale scolaire cantonale. La non couverture d’un enfant serait plus coûteuse à prendre en charge au niveau sociétal (CHF 65 000) que les coûts engendrés par notre modèle (CHF 11 400). Compte tenu du rapport coût-efficacité positif du modèle, il est décidé d’étendre le modèle à tous les vaccins administrés dans les établissements scolaires du canton de Vaud.}

abstract = {Objective/Background
Globally, approximately 50% of patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) experience treatment failure. MDR-TB treatment is hindered by adverse events, toxicity of the second-line anti-TB drugs, logistics and costs, especially in low-income countries, and problems with medication adherence. Pharmacokinetic variability is also attributed as one of the reasons contributing to treatment failure. In our reference Tuberculosis Center Beatrixoord (University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands), we strive to individualize treatment of all MDR-TB patients based on drug-susceptibility testing using minimal inhibitory concentrations and pharmacokinetic parameters. The aim of this work is to give an overview of our efforts to individualize treatment of MDR-TB patients and to provide insights into practical tools that might be implemented in other clinical settings worldwide.
Methods
We critically looked at clinical practice guidelines implemented in our center to give an overview of practically applied tools to individualize treatment of MDR-TB patients. Furthermore, we selected studies carried out in our clinic on treatment individualization of MDR-TB patients and combined their results with recent studies in this area to suggest practical tools for implementation in other clinical settings.
Results
We regularly perform therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of several second-line anti-TB drugs, such as amikacin, kanamycin, linezolid, and moxifloxacin. New analyses of Group D and experimental drugs, such as co-trimoxazole (sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim), bedaquiline, delamanid, and clarithromycin, have been or are being developed. By implementing TDM methods, variability in pharmacokinetics is often detected and treatment is adjusted, possibly preventing toxicity in patients with very high drug exposure or treatment failure, or resistance in patients with very low drug exposure. Over the past 10years in the Netherlands, 86% of 104 patients had a successful outcome using a median of six active drugs. Many studies were performed using dried blood spot (DBS) analysis of second-line TB drugs. These studies may be used to implement TDM worldwide, even in low-income countries. Furthermore, several studies are performed to determine limited sampling strategies (LSSs). By limiting the number samples required for adequate sampling, TDM will become easier to implement. Other examples of LSSs included development of oral fluid sampling methods or development of semiquantitative thin-layer chromatography methods.
Conclusion
TDM is highly valuable to individualize and optimize treatment of complex MDR-TB patients. TDM is routinely applied in Tuberculosis Center Beatrixoord, and high success rates for treatment of MDR-TB patients have been achieved. DBS and LSS make implementation of TDM feasible, even in low- and middle-income countries.}

abstract = {Recently, aquaculture and captive breeding have commenced for a raft of large fish species, including bluefin tuna (Thunnus orientalis), kingfish (Seriola lalandi) and giant grouper (Epinephelus lanceolatus). With captive breeding, there is often interest to conduct selection and genetic improvement, but these large species present many and substantial challenges to selective breeding. Indeed there are no reports or examples that selection response and forward genetic gain has been achieved for such large and problematic species. These large species, typified by kingfish, are characterized by immense fecundity with ensuing opportunity for intense domestication selection, either adverse or synergistic, that can impact on planned selection response. Moreover, because of size and logistics, typically few broodstock are held and chance sampling of few broodstock individuals has the potential to confound selection response and the repeatability of response. The main objective here was to assess if forward selection response could be achieved after selection for adult weight of kingfish in sea cages. Selection response was estimated by comparing the performance of F1 offspring from wild parents with F2 offspring from selected parents during the larval rearing and adult growout. Pedigree data, from genotyping approximately 1000 individuals using up to 17 DNA microsatellite loci, was added to the larval and adult performance data to resolve the contributions of different sire and dam lineages. For most traits measured, whether larval survival, incidence of larval deformity, adult weights or adult condition factor, the offspring of selected parents outperformed those from wild parents, whether animals were grown separately in replicate (larval rearing tanks) or communally as adults in tanks. Larval survival was not deliberated selected, yet the dropout of specific parental sire or dam lineages suggest in part genetic differences account for some of the differences between the F1 and F2. Observed selection responses for adult weights and condition factor were greater than those predicted from covariances of relatives. Either (synergistic) domestication selection or some type of magnification of line differences under communal rearing may account for these data. The chance sampling of particularly good or bad broodstock sires or dams did not seem to have been a major contributor to the strain testing results. Whether this means that selection responses are repeatable even when using few broodstock, a situation unavoidable for large marine species, is discussed in terms of how intense deliberate and possible domestication selection could narrow the variances of breeding values of selected broodstock.
Statement of relevance
Can we select large marine species with few broodstock?}

abstract = {In recent years, the Mars One program has gained significant publicity for its plans to colonize the red planet. Beginning in 2025, the program plans to land four people on Mars every 26 months via a series of one-way missions, using exclusively existing technology. This one-way approach has frequently been cited as a key enabler of accelerating the first crewed landing on Mars. While the Mars One program has received considerable attention, little has been published in the technical literature regarding the formulation of its mission architecture. In light of this, we perform an independent analysis of the technical feasibility of the Mars One mission plan, focusing on the architecture of the life support and in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) systems, and their impact on sparing and space logistics. To perform this analysis, we adopt an iterative analysis approach in which we model and simulate the mission architecture, assess its feasibility, implement any applicable modifications while attempting to remain within the constraints set forth by Mars One, and then resimulate and reanalyze the revised version of the mission architecture. Where required information regarding the Mars One mission architecture is not available, we assume numerical values derived from standard spaceflight design handbooks and documents. Through four iterations of this process, our analysis finds that the Mars One mission plan, as publicly described, is not feasible. This conclusion is obtained from analyses based on mission assumptions derived from and constrained by statements made by Mars One, and is the result of the following findings: (1) several technologies including ISRU, life support, and entry, descent, and landing (EDL) are not currently “existing, validated and available” as claimed by Mars One; (2) the crop growth area described by Mars One is insufficient to feed their crew; (3) increasing the crop growth area to provide sufficient food for the crew leads to atmospheric imbalances that requires a prohibitively large ISRU atmospheric processor or a notably different system architecture to manage; and (4) at least 13 Falcon Heavy launches are needed to deliver a portion of the required equipment to the Martian surface, a value that is at least double that planned by Mars One for the same mission phase. Most importantly, we find that the one-way nature of the Mars One mission, coupled with its plans to increase its crew population every 26 months, causes the operating costs of the program to grow continually over time. This is due to the fact that maintaining a growing colony on the Martian surface incurs increasing equipment and spare parts resupply requirements and hence launch costs over time. Based on published launch vehicle and lander estimates, our analysis finds that by the launch of the fifth crew, the cost associated with launching a portion of all required equipment and spares is approximately equal to half of the total NASA FY2015 budget – and this cost will grow when other critical systems outside the scope of this analysis are included. To mitigate these costs and bring the plan closer towards feasibility, we recommend a number of mission architecture modifications and technology development efforts be implemented before the initiation of any Mars settlement campaign. These include the further development of EDL, life support, and ISRU technologies, as well as additive manufacturing technology that utilizes ISRU-derived Martian feedstock as a potential means to address the growing cost of resupply.}

abstract = {Resumen
México se ha convertido en el séptimo productor mundial de vehículos automotores, pero su función es ensamblar partes y componentes procedentes de las empresas globales, principalmente de Estados Unidos, que absorbe la parte mayoritaria de las re-exportaciones. El auge del ensamble automotriz está relacionado con dos procesos fundamentales: de una parte tiende a culminar el objetivo gubernamental de aumentar el empleo y la captación de divisas en un momento crítico, pues las re-exportaciones de electrónicos mostraron signos de desaceleración por otro lado, la región Centro-Occidental donde se han concentrado la apertura de las nuevas plantas ha aumentado su participación en el PIB nacional, provocando un cambio en el balance nacional. En primera instancia, este creciente rol jugado por México en las redes de producción global podría verse como una oportunidad para lanzar una estrategia de aprendizaje tecnológico al estilo asiático. Sin embargo, no es ese el caso, no por las razones que se esgrimen habitualmente —es decir, falta de iniciativa— sino por problemas estructurales de larga gestación relacionados con la naturaleza de la reforma económica neoliberal, que acotaron sustancialmente el margen estratégico de acción para instaurar políticas alternativas. El artículo concluye señalando que un resultado no planificado del auge del ensamble es la aparición de una plataforma productivo-logística derivada de la relativa proximidad en que operan las plantas en esa estratégica región del país; esa plataforma parece abrir oportunidades inéditas de asociación de empresas locales a las automotrices redes globales, principalmente en el sector servicios. Irónicamente, esta oportunidad parece no haberse visualizado ni existen, por lo mencionado arriba, los instrumentos de promoción para efectuar ese giro.
Mexico has become the seventh world producer of automotive vehicles, but its function as an assembler of parts and components from global firms, mainly from the United States, which absorbs almost 90% of the re-exports. The boom in automotive assembly is associated with two fundamental processes: on the one hand, it culminates the government effort to increase employment and foreign exchange earnings in a critical moment because of the slowdown on electronics re-export. In addition to sustaining and expanding the assembly, the Government is committed to the modernization of the infrastructure, mainly road and ports. On the other hand, the states on Central-Western region, where new plants have been recently opening, have increased their share in the GDP, causing a change at national level. In the first place, this increasing role played by Mexico in global production networks could be seen as an opportunity to launch an Asian-style strategy for technological learning. However, this is not the case, and not for the reasons that is usually offered, i.e., lack of initiative, but due to long-standing structural problems related to the nature of neo-liberal economic reform, a reform that curtails the scope for strategic action towards new economic policies. The article concludes by stating that an unplanned result of the automotive assembly boom is the emergence of a sort of platform for production and logistics derived from the relative proximity of plants in that strategic region of the country. That platform could open a new opportunity for the integration of local companies as suppliers to automotive global networks, mainly in the service sector. Ironically, this opportunity is not perceived by policy makers, and for the reason state above, its looks like there is no economic policy instrument at hand to make that change.}

abstract = {Cows that exhibit estrus prior to fixed-time AI had increased sperm transport to the site of fertilization, and improved embryo quality on d 6 after insemination. Sperm transport is influenced by uterine pH, and research has reported that uterine pH decreased at onset of estrus, but must return to normal prior to ovulation. Therefore, the objectives of these studies were to investigate a possible mechanism for the regulation of uterine pH around the onset of estrus, and to determine if uterine pH at time of fixed-time AI influenced pregnancy success. In experiment 1, Angus-cross beef cows (n=40 and 28 in rep. 1 and 2, respectively) were synchronized with the PG 6-day CIDR protocol (PGF2α on d -9, GnRH and insertion of a CIDR on d -6, and PGF2α and CIDR removal on d 0). Cows were blocked by follicle size at time of CIDR removal, and uterine biopsies were collected at 0, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60 (Rep. 1), 72, 84, or 96h (Rep2) after CIDR removal, and total cellular RNA was extracted from all biopsies. Estrus was monitored by the HeatWatch Estrous Detection System. In experiment 2, 223 postpartum beef cows in 2 herds were synchronized with a fixed-time AI protocol (herd 1: n=97; CO-Synch plus CIDR protocol; herd 2: n=126; Co-synch protocol). Uterine pH was determined at time of AI (n=80 and 63 for herd 1 and 2, respectively), and estrus was monitored by visual estrus detection with the aid of an ESTROTECT estrous detection patches, and pregnancy was determined by transrectal ultrasonography. In experiment 1, there was a significant (P<0.01), quadratic relationship in expression of Na+/H+ exchanger isoforms 1, 2, and 3 among animals that exhibited estrus, with expression greatest at time of CIDR removal, decreasing to the onset of estrus, and then increasing again following the onset of estrus. Among cows that did not exhibit estrus, the preceding relationship did not exist (P>0.46). In experiment 2, cows that had initiated estrus prior to fixed-time AI had decreased (P=0.01) uterine pH compared to cows that did not initiate estrus (6.78±0.03 and 6.89±0.03, respectively), and uterine pH at AI had an approximately linear effect on pregnancy success within the observed pH range. Furthermore, cows that initiated estrus prior to AI had increased (P=0.05) pregnancy success (52% vs. 38%) compared to cows that had not initiated estrus. In summary, expression of Na+/H+ exchanger isoforms 1, 2, and 3 decreased after CIDR removal among cows that exhibited estrus, but did not change among cows that did not exhibit estrus. Additionally, as uterine pH decreased pregnancy success tended to increase (P=0.076, logistics regression). Thus, Na+/H+ exchanger isoforms 1, 2, and 3 appear to be key regulators of uterine pH around the onset of estrus, and this change in uterine pH is critical for pregnancy success.
Summary sentence
Expression of Na+/H+ exchanger isoforms 1, 2, and 3 decreased after CIDR removal among cows that exhibited estrus, but did not change among cows that did not exhibit estrus, and as uterine pH decreased, pregnancy success tended to increase.}

Introduction
The clinical skills learned by students during their training are the main tools for the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of neurological diseases. Assessment is essential in the teaching-learning process. A Structured Objective Clinical Examination (SOCE) is a method for assessing clinical skills that can be used both as summative and formative assessment. It consists of stations that form a circuit. In each station the student faces a scenario that evaluates the clinical skills domain in three areas: cognitive, attitudinal, and psychomotor. Its implementation is helpful in evaluating professional skills of a curriculum with clinical qualities.
Objective
The objective of this study was to design and pilot an SOCE to assess neurological clinical skills in medical internship students.
Method
A committee was formed including 12 experts in neurology, who were trained to design an SOCE. A clinical skills specification table was constructed in order to assess clinical cases. This was followed by designing an SOCE with 7 clinical skills that included: history, physical examination, diagnosis, treatment, interpretation of studies, decision making, and prevention. In each test station, its contents and checklists were validated by the review committee. A pilot test was applied to 14 medical internship students. The mean, and overall, Cronbach alpha was obtained for each station.
Results
An SOCE of 18 stations was designed and pilot tested. A mean of 6.53 was obtained, with an overall Cronbach alpha of 0.62 in the examination.
Conclusions
An SOCE allows clinical skills to be evaluated in a planned manner. The key elements for design are: the examination committee, table specifications, and design and logistics of the test stations.}

abstract = {Single wagonload (SWL) transport is a major component in European rail transport systems and in the logistics of different industrial sectors such as steel, chemical and automotive. However, changing framework conditions and increasingly demanding market requirements have led to dramatic losses of market share and even to complete shutdown of SWL business in some countries. As this business segment has been evaluated as an important component of the European co-modal transport system also in the future, significant improvements are needed. The ViWaS project develops and proposes solutions which contribute to a raised competitiveness of SWL in Europe. Unlike in road transport, load tracking and tracing is still not widely used in SWL. ViWaS seeks to accelerate the introduction of communication technology in rail freight. With on-board communication technology freight operators improve the dispatching of wagons and the rescheduling processes in case of disturbances. Based on reliable on-line telematics data, the dispatchers will be able to inform their customers about changes in the transport schedule earlier than today, increasing the reliability and satisfying the stakeholders. Cost-efficient and intelligent telematics-based information services enable real-time wagon tracking and automatically depict wagon mileage information. The telematics data service will generate the required information which is necessary for a reliable quality recording. With this additional information, the current life cycle of freight wagons of six years will be optimised. Since the accident of Viareggio, the railway authorities are requesting documentation of wagon mileage. A small electronic mile-counter with a-radio link to the telematics device RodoTAG® overtakes the RU's responsibility of wheel-set individual mileage counting. Based on long term experiences with NavMaster telematics, Eureka defined a list of requirements for the system design “small, lightweight and cost reducing”, resulting in a completely new system concept: The ViWaS telematics PCB is very small sized and equipped with a low power multi-GNSS (GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, QZSS and SBAS) circuit. With the new GSM and GPS modules, a significant cost reduction could be achieved, interfaces for complementing sensors as e.g. shock detection, digital/analogue inputs/outputs, etc. are integrated. In addition, based on the analysis of user requirements the development of a reliable load sensing technology for freight cars has been launched. This request is a result of the fact that today most of the freight cars in railway operation do not use the full load capacity as there is no existing cost-effective possibility to measure the load especially during the filling-up process e.g. in the area of bulk freight. If the wagon would be overloaded and afterwards moved by a train, all wheel sets have to be exchanged for a costly inspection in a workshop. Thus, the freight car will not be filled to its maximum payload resulting in reduced capacity and higher costs. In order to optimise the dispatching processes wagons will transmit their load status, enabling the dispatchers to re-dispatch the wagon in short time after unloading leading to shorter standstill times and higher wagon efficiency.}

abstract = {Objective
The objective of this prospective RCT was to compare the efficacy of a web-based teaching tool to traditional didactic teaching in IVF patients.
Methods
Forty women undergoing their first IVF cycle were randomly allocated to an interactive web-based teaching session or a nurse-led didactic teaching session. The primary outcome measure was participant knowledge regarding the IVF process, risks, and logistics assessed before and after the respective teaching session. Secondary outcomes included patient stress, assessed before and after the respective teaching session, and patient satisfaction, assessed following the respective teaching session and on the day of embryo transfer (following implementation of the teaching protocol).
Results
Both groups demonstrated similar and significant improvements in knowledge and stress after exposure to their respective teaching sessions. The web-based group was significantly more satisfied than the didactic teaching group. Web-based teaching was also shown to be equally effective for participants of high versus low income and education status for knowledge, stress, and satisfaction.
Conclusion
This study provides preliminary support for the use of web-based teaching as an equally effective tool for increasing knowledge and reducing stress compared to traditional didactic teaching in IVF patients, with the added benefit of increased patient satisfaction.
Résumé
Objectif
L'objectif de cet ECR prospectif était de comparer l'efficacité d'un outil de formation en ligne et d'une méthode d'enseignement didactique traditionnelle destinés aux patientes en fécondation in vitro (FIV).
Méthodologie
Quarante femmes qui entamaient leur premier cycle de FIV, réparties aléatoirement en deux groupes d'apprentissage, ont reçu soit une séance de formation interactive en ligne, soit une séance d'enseignement didactique donnée par une infirmière. Le critère d'évaluation principal était le niveau de connaissances des participantes au sujet du processus de FIV, des risques associés et de la logistique, évalué avant et après la séance de formation. Les critères secondaires étaient le stress ressenti par les patientes, évalué avant et après la séance de formation, ainsi que le degré de satisfaction des patientes, évalué après la séance de formation et le jour du transfert d'embryon (après la mise en place du protocole de formation).
Résultats
Les patientes assignées aux deux groupes ont connu une amélioration comparable et significative de leur niveau de connaissances et du stress ressenti après leur séance de formation respective. Le groupe ayant reçu la formation en ligne avait un degré de satisfaction significativement plus élevé que le groupe d'enseignement didactique. De plus, la formation en ligne s'est montrée également efficace peu importe le revenu et la scolarité des patientes, et ce, pour les trois critères (connaissances, stress et satisfaction).
Conclusion
Cette étude constitue un appui préliminaire au recours à la formation en ligne : elle démontre que cette méthode est aussi efficace que l'enseignement didactique pour l'acquisition de connaissances et la réduction du stress chez les patientes en FIV, et qu'elle est associée à un degré de satisfaction plus élevé.}

abstract = {Background
Percentage excess weight loss (%EWL) outcome of bariatric surgery is distorted by deviations in baseline body mass index (BMI). It has been reported that this can lead to false conclusions, most likely because bariatric weight loss in fact is baseline-BMI independent.
Objectives
If the metabolic effect of bariatric surgery is baseline-BMI independent as well, could %EWL also lead to false conclusions on metabolic surgery?
Setting
Bariatric Center of Excellence, general hospital, Netherlands.
Methods
Retrospective analysis of 1-year outcome of all consecutive primary gastric bypass patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Metabolic outcome (glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c], T2DM medication) was compared with bariatric outcome (weight loss) using 3 different metrics: %EWL, the most popular weight loss metric among bariatric surgeons; percentage (total) weight loss (%WL), most commonly used by nonsurgical professionals; and percentage alterable weight loss (%AWL), the only metric rendering weight loss outcome independent of baseline BMI. Metabolic success (HbA1c≤6.0%, T2DM remission) was compared with different definitions of bariatric success (≥50 %EWL, BMI<35 kg/m2, %AWL percentiles; Mann-Whitney test; P< .05).
Results
Until May 2014, 2001 patients underwent primary laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB), of whom 449 had T2DM with baseline BMI 43.3 kg/m2, mean 1.6 number of T2DM medication and HbA1c 7.5%. At 1 year 95% follow-up, with BMI 30.5 kg/m2, 52.1% T2DM remission, 86.9% HbA1c<7.0%, and 63.6% without T2DM medication. No significant differences in T2DM outcome and weight loss were found with different baseline BMI, except for %EWL (P<.001). Weight loss was significantly better with better T2DM outcome, but for %EWL contradictory relationships were found in baseline-BMI subgroups. T2DM outcome was not less successful for patients with<50 %EWL.
Conclusion
In T2DM patients, weight loss after gastric bypass does not depend on BMI, HbA1c, or T2DM medication at baseline. The popular %EWL metric and the 50 %EWL success criterion are problematic in comparing bariatric and metabolic outcome of gastric bypass surgery. They should be abandoned. The %WL metric is the best and most commonly used alternative, whereas %AWL is ideal for selected logistics in bariatric research. Weight loss percentiles are best suited for defining bariatric success in metabolic surgery.}

On one hand, there is the need to fulfil a fundamental human need for nutrition, and on the other hand this poses critical threats to the environment. In order to assess the environmental impact of food consumption, a lifecycle assessment (LCA)-based approach has been applied to a basket of products, selected as being representative of EU consumption. A basket of food products was identified as representative of the average food and beverage consumption in Europe, reflecting the relative importance of the products in terms of mass and economic value. The products in the basket are: pork, beef, poultry, milk, cheese, butter, bread, sugar, sunflower oil, olive oil, potatoes, oranges, apples, mineral water, roasted coffee, beer and pre-prepared meals. For each product in the basket, a highly disaggregated inventory model was developed based on a modular approach, and built using statistical data. The environmental impact of the average food consumption of European citizens was assessed using the International Reference Life Cycle Data System (ILCD) methodology. The overall results indicate that, for most of the impact categories, the consumed foods with the highest environmental burden are meat products (beef, pork and poultry) and dairy products (cheese, milk and butter). The agricultural phase is the lifecycle stage that has the highest impact of all the foods in the basket, due to the contribution of agronomic and zootechnical activities. Food processing and logistics are the next most important phases in terms of environmental impacts, due to their energy intensity and the related emissions to the atmosphere that occur through the production of heat, steam and electricity and during transport. Regarding the end-of-life phase, human excretion and wastewater treatments pose environmental burdens related to eutrophying substances whose environmental impacts are greater than those of the agriculture, transports and processing phases. Moreover, food losses which occur throughout the whole lifecycle, in terms of agricultural/industrial and domestic food waste, have also to be taken into consideration, since they can amount to up to 60% of the initial weight of the food products. The results of the study go beyond the mere assessment of the potential impacts associated with food consumption, as the overall approach may serve as a baseline for testing eco-innovation scenarios for impact reduction as well as for setting targets.}

Introducción
La fibrinólisis intravenosa disminuye la discapacidad secundaria al accidente cerebrovascular isquémico (ACVi). En Argentina menos del 1% de los pacientes con ACVi reciben tratamiento fibrinolítico, la mayoría en el sector privado. Existe consenso en la literatura acerca de la organización necesaria de los recursos para la administración de dicho tratamiento con la seguridad adecuada.
Objetivo
Reportar la experiencia sobre el uso del tratamiento fibrinolítico en un hospital público municipal de General Villegas, provincia de Buenos Aires.
Métodos
Descripción de la población, sistema de salud, y análisis retrospectivo de los registros hospitalarios de pacientes tratados con fibrinólisis intravenosa a causa de un ACVi desde junio de 2011 hasta agosto de 2015.
Resultados
La ciudad dispone de un hospital público de mediana complejidad. Desde la implementación del protocolo de tratamiento, 9 de 125 pacientes internados por ACVi recibieron fibrinólisis intravenosa (7,2%). En todos los casos el tiempo de ventana fue<3h y el tiempo puerta-aguja<60min. La edad promedio y escala de NIH de ingreso fueron 65 años (28-81) y 15 (7-20). No se registraron complicaciones hemorrágicas en las TC de control.
Conclusiones
En Argentina el tratamiento fibrinolítico para el ACVi está subutilizado, principalmente en el sector público. Si se cuenta con personal motivado, sería factible generalizar este tratamiento siempre y cuando se cuente con los recursos básicos recomendados en la literatura.
Introduction
Intravenous fibrinolysis decreases disability after an ischemic stroke. In Argentina less than 1% of the patients with ischemic stroke receive intravenous r-TPA, mainly in the private sector. There is consensus in the literature about the structure and resources needed to implement this therapy safely.
Objective
To report the experience in the use of r-TPA in a public hospital of General Villegas, Province of Buenos Aires, Argentina.
Methods
Description of the population and public health system in General Villegas and retrospective analysis of hospital records of patients with ischemic stroke treated with intravenous r-TPA.
Results
The city has a public hospital with 40 in-patient beds. Nine of 125 patients, received intravenous r-TPA for acute ischemic stroke (7.2%). Time window and door-to-needle time were < 3 hours and < 60 minutes, respectively, in all cases. Average age was 65 (28-81) years and NIHSS 15 (7-20). There were no hemorrhagic complications on the follow-up brain CT scan.
Conclusions
In Argentina intravenous r-TPA treatment is underused, especially in the public sector. With proper protocols and logistics, it would be possible to implement this treatment even in small towns with basic resources, as recommended in current guidelines.}

abstract = {Rail transports of single wagons or wagon groups are an indispensable part of the transport chain, such as for the forestry and the chemical industry. However, high production costs and low quality standards have led to a continuous decline in market shares in recent years. In order to counteract this tendency, ten European companies and research institutions, covering the areas of rail transport and logistics, have combined their forces in the scope of the research and development project ViWaS (Viable Wagonload Production Schemes). The goal: Innovative and simultaneously practical solutions for a sustainable wagonload transport. The applicability of these solutions and their effects have been proven with the aid of business cases in terms of field tests and pilot operations. The following main innovations have been achieved within the ViWaS project:(1)Improved “last-mile” operating concepts incorporating hybrid locomotives and bi-modal shunting engines (by Bentheimer Eisenbahn, Fret SNCF and SBB Cargo supported by HaCon and NEWOPERA): The new production method for last-mile delivery is based on the idea of separating train movements and sidings shunting processes by deploying bimodal road-rail tractors. Processes within the sidings have been simplified; as a result costs for equipment and staff could be reduced considerably. Hybrid locomotives are fundamental in securing a seamless access to regional distribution rail networks. Potential cost advantages have been identified comparing different traction combinations of real-life transport chains.(2)Modular wagon technologies for a flexible and efficient use of resources (by Wascosa and SBB Cargo): In detail, three components have been developed up to prototype status: Wascosa's Flex Freight Car is a light container wagon with an accessible floor and thereby applicable for various transport purposes. The Timber Cassette 2.0 is a new superstructure for log wood transport that features foldable stanchions and can be used in combination with a container wagon. In case the Timber Cassette is not loaded, it can be removed and stacked at the terminal or on a container wagon. Empty runs will be minimized generating efficiency improvements. Additionally, SBB Cargo has developed the so-called Container Loading Adapter, another add-on to a container wagon. It facilitates container loading and unloading in sidings. SBB Cargo will deploy this new component within the “Swiss Split” production system, combining intermodal with wagonload transport.(3)Smart wagon telematics allowing improved tracking at reduced costs (by Eureka): A separate abstract “Smart Telematics Enabling Efficient Rail Transport” (Contribution ID 875) has been submitted for TRA 2016).4.A new simulation tool for planning and optimizing single wagonload networks (by ETH Zürich): WagonSIM is an agent-based simulation tool for rail freight networks to facilitate the optimization of SWL production schemes. It is based on the OpenSource software MatSIM. The tool models the routing of freight wagons according to the routes within the real SWL network. Therefore, the modelling of two network levels is required, the production network and the physical infrastructure. The ViWaS project is co-financed by the European Commission in the scope of the Seventh Framework Programme.}

abstract = {The focus of this paper is the risk management of total supply chains by identifying the risk drivers that could appear simultaneously, and the determination of their common denominator to mitigate supply chain risk using the Net Present Value (NPV) approach in Extended Material Requirements Planning (Extended MRP) models. Any risk driver that is likely to disrupt the procurement, production, transportation, warehousing, delivery or financing of a good or service constitutes a realisation of supply chain risk. Risk drivers often appear simultaneously. It is imperative, therefore, that an a priori assessment of the risk drivers that pose risk to the global supply chain is undertaken and that contingency plans are developed at every level to monitor and mitigate these risks, even when they appear simultaneously. To avoid the ruin of a supply chain we must ensure the availability of adequate funds in conjunction with safety stock. Therefore, the risk-mitigation approach pursued in our paper follows from our conviction that money is the stock of purchasing power of any activity cell in a global supply chain that could influence the perturbation of material flows—on many stages simultaneously. In the paper, we provide a method appropriate for preventing the long-term disruption of a supply chain with probability determined in advance. How to assure resilience of a global supply chain is the question which has occupied the World Economic Forum since 2009. The Industry Agendas in Davos expressed the need to develop a risk assessment framework for the end-to-end supply chain which has not been developed yet. The article presents how company owners, regulators, and board members of supply chains can build the risk assessment framework on a similar requirement as that accepted in the insurance industry, capturing knowledge from the Solvency II framework, and embed the constraints in the extended MRP model. Such a quantitative tool can be used to exercise the “stress tests” of the total chain according to assumptions and plans. In the presented methodology, as a novelty first developed here, we show how the perturbation of intensity in production and logistics, simultaneous perturbations in the timing of financial flows, information flows, flows of items and market perturbations can be better evaluated simultaneously through Laplace transforms and the NPV expression which allow for a control of physical and financial flows simultaneously. Our paper follows the Davos 2013 conclusions analysed by Forbes that “To maintain effectiveness, supply chain managers can arrange to share strategic stocks, or to enter into joint supply agreements. They can also pre-arrange ways to access critical stocks”. Therefore risks should be evaluated on the level of the end-to-end supply chain, and not only on the level of the companies involved. The paper suggests that resilience of a chain is measured by the probability that the NPV of the chain will not fall under the critical value determined in advance, and the yearly mathematical reservations are derived.}

abstract = {Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematological disease of plasma B cells that remains incurable despite the availability of numerous therapies. The plasma cell-specific expression of the TNF superfamily receptor BCMA may allow targeting of normal and malignant plasma cells. Genetically engineered chimeric antigen-receptor T cells (CAR T) have shown tremendous promise in the treatment of several hematological diseases, including MM. However, conventional autologous CAR T therapies use patient-derived T cells and the logistics of on-demand CAR T manufacture limits their availability to a broad patient pool. Here we describe the preclinical evaluation of an allogeneic CAR T therapy targeting BCMA that has the potential for a readily available, off-the-shelf therapy for MM and other malignancies expressing BCMA. Human T cells were transduced with recombinant lentiviral vectors encoding three BCMA CAR candidates designed with fully human anti-BCMA scFvs, CD8a transmembrane domains and the intracellular signaling domains of 4-1BB and CD3zeta. All CAR T efficiently killed BCMA-expressing multiple myeloma cell lines (KMS12BM, MM1.S, Molp-8 and OPM-2), but not BCMA-negative REH cells in vitro and in vivo. Whereas 2 of the 3 candidates exhibited target-independent cytokine production, accelerated T cell differentiation and reduced target cell-induced expansion in vitro, the third candidate did not exhibit this scFv-induced autoactivation and was chosen as the lead molecule. Due to the allogeneic nature of this T cell therapy, the possibility of graft-versus-host (GvH) reactions can be a safety concern. We applied Cellectis’ know-how and TALEN® technology for the gene inactivation of the T cell receptor (TCR) alpha chain to significantly reduce the probability for TCR-mediated GvH reactions and found that TCR knockout did not affect CAR T activity in vitro or in vivo. Furthermore, we incorporated intra-CAR rituximab-recognition domains into the CAR molecule to enable depletion of CAR T cells from patients when necessary. We found that this modified CAR retained anti-BCMA CAR T activity and enabled CAR T depletion by rituximab. Another aspect of allogeneic CAR T therapies is the rejection of the CAR T by host-versus-graft (HvG) reactions. Lymphodepletion prior to CAR T infusion enhances CAR T efficacy in autologous CAR T trials and may also prevent anti-CAR HvG reactions in allogeneic therapy settings. Engineering lymphodepletion resistance into CAR T cells could therefore enable sustained lymphodepletion for enhanced allogeneic CAR T persistence and efficacy. CD52 is expressed on all lymphocytes and administration of the anti-CD52 antibody alemtuzumab for prolonged lymphodepletion is an approved treatment for multiple sclerosis. TALEN®-mediated knockout of CD52 protected BCMA CAR T from alemtuzumab-induced cytotoxicity and did not alter BCMA CAR T anti-tumor activity. Taken together these results support allogeneic BCMA CAR T as an off-the-shelf adoptive immunotherapy for the treatment of multiple myeloma and other BCMA-positive malignancies.

Les horaires décalés concernent environ 60 % des personnels travaillant « au sol » sur la plateforme aéroportuaire d’Orly. Nombreux sont les salariés demandant des aménagements d’horaires par intercession du médecin du travail.
Objectifs
Décrire les horaires décalés de travail, leurs effets sur la santé, la sécurité, le retentissement psychosocial. Comparer « horaires décalés réguliers » (HDR) et « horaires décalés irréguliers » (HDI).
Méthode
Enquête descriptive transversale par auto-questionnaire anonyme standardisé renseigné par le salarié au centre médical.
Résultats
Entre janvier et septembre 2014, 203 questionnaires valides ont été analysés. L’échantillon était majoritairement masculin (63 %), avec une moyenne d’âge de 36,5ans. Deux tiers travaillaient en HDI. Les activités professionnelles se répartissaient de la manière suivante : sûreté (81,6 %), escale (70 %), restauration (65,2 %), logistique piste (58,1 %). Un tiers des répondants rapportait des troubles du sommeil (32,8 %), près de 40 % s’estimaient stressés du fait de leur travail (38,5 %) et deux tiers témoignaient d’un impact négatif sur l’organisation familiale (66,1 %). Près de 15 % déclaraient des assoupissements fréquents pendant le travail et deux tiers évoquaient un risque accru d’accident du travail. L’analyse multivariée retrouvait, comme facteurs de risque des troubles du sommeil, le travail en HDI (OR 1,4) et le week-end et/ou les jours fériés (OR 8,2), l’âge supérieur à 30ans (OR 1,6), les difficultés d’arrangements de planning avec les collègues (OR 1,8). Pour l’impact sur l’organisation familiale, ressortaient à nouveau le travail en HDI (OR 2,1) et le week-end et/ou les jours fériés (OR 4,8), mais aussi la présence d’enfants au foyer (OR 3,6) et l’imprévisibilité du planning de travail (OR 2,3).
Discussion
Malgré une puissance statistique modeste, cette étude permet de documenter les liens entre horaires décalés de travail, retentissement sur la santé et impact psychosocial.
Conclusion
Les répercussions des horaires de travail décalés sont multiples. La variante « irrégulière » en majore les effets néfastes.
Summary
Purpose
Shifts in work hours concern a large proportion of the ground staff at Orly Airport. Numerous employees request the occupational medicine services to adjust working hours. The objective is to describe work hour shifts, the effect on health and security, and possible psychosocial side effects. We also aim to compare regular, and irregular, shifts in work hours.
Method
The cross-sectional study was carried out using a standardized anonymous list of questions answered by employees during an occupational medicine visit.
Results
From January to September 2014, 203 valid questionnaires were examined. The majority of the sample was masculine (63%), with average age of 36.5 years. Two-third worked on irregular work hour shifts. They were employed as follows: security (81.6%), stopover (70%), food service (65.2%), runway logistics (58.1%). One-third of the respondents reported sleep problems (32.8%), about 40% felt stressed due to their work (38.5%), and two-third stated there was negative impact on the organization of their family life (66.1%). Around 15% declared frequent napping during work hours, and two-third mentioned increased risk for workplace accidents. The multivariate analysis found as risk factors: sleeplessness, irregular work hour shifts (OR 1.4), weekend and/or holiday work (OR 8.2), age over 30 (OR 1.6), difficulty in arranging work hours with co-workers (OR 1.8). For the impact on family organization, irregular work hour shifts (OR 2.1) and weekend and/or holiday work (OR 4.8) again emerged as factors, as well as the presence of children in the household (OR 3.6) and the unpredictability of the work schedule (OR 2.3).
Conclusion
The health consequences of shifts in working hours are multiple, amplified by the negative effects of irregular scheduling.}

abstract = {Despite regulatory efforts and position papers, electrical and electronic waste (e-waste) remains ill-managed as evidenced by the extremely low rates of proper e-waste recycling (e-recycling) worldwide, ongoing illegal shipments to developing countries and constantly reported human health issues and environmental pollution. The objectives of this review are, first, to expose the complexity of e-waste problems, and then to suggest possible upstream and downstream solutions. Exploring e-waste issues is akin to opening a Pandora's box. Thus, a review of prevailing e-waste management practices reveals complex and often intertwined gaps, issues and challenges. These include the absence of any consistent definition of e-waste to date, a prevalent toxic potential still involving already banned or restricted hazardous components such as heavy metals and persistent and bioaccumulative organic compounds, a relentless growth in e-waste volume fueled by planned obsolescence and unsustainable consumption, problematic e-recycling processes, a fragile formal e-recycling sector, sustained and more harmful informal e-recycling practices, and more convoluted and unpredictable patterns of illegal e-waste trade. A close examination of the e-waste legacy contamination reveals critical human health concerns, including significant occupational exposure during both formal and informal e-recycling, and persistent environmental contamination, particularly in some developing countries. However, newly detected e-waste contaminants as well as unexpected sources and environmental fates of contaminants are among the emerging issues that raise concerns. Moreover, scientific knowledge gaps remain regarding the complexity and magnitude of the e-waste legacy contamination, specifically, a comprehensive characterization of e-waste contaminants, information on the scale of legacy contamination in developing countries and on the potential environmental damage in developed countries, and a stronger body of evidence of adverse health effects specifically ascribed to e-waste contaminants. However, the knowledge accumulated to date is sufficient to raise awareness and concern among all stakeholders. Potential solutions to curb e-waste issues should be addressed comprehensively, by focusing on two fronts: upstream and downstream. Potential upstream solutions should focus on more rational and eco-oriented consumer habits in order to decrease e-waste quantities while fostering ethical and sustained commitments from manufacturers, which include a limited usage of hazardous compounds and an optimal increase in e-waste recyclability. At the downstream level, solutions should include suitable and pragmatic actions to progressively reduce the illegal e-waste trade particularly through international cooperation and coordination, better enforcement of domestic laws, and monitoring in both exporting and receiving countries, along with the supervised integration of the informal sector into the recycling system of developing countries and global expansion of formal e-waste collection and recycling activities. Downstream solutions should also introduce stronger reverse logistics, together with upgraded, more affordable, and eco-friendly and worker-friendly e-recycling technologies to ensure that benefits are derived fully and safely from the great economic potential of e-waste.}

abstract = {Résumé
Introduction
Le traitement par chimiothérapie intrapéritonéale hyperthermique (CHIP) améliore la survie globale du cancer de l’ovaire avec carcinose péritonéale. Cependant, les complications associées et la toxicité limitent son utilisation. Pour améliorer la technique chirurgicale, des modèles animaux permettant de travailler sur de grands groupes sans logistique lourde sont nécessaires. Nous avons entrepris de développer et d’évaluer la morbidité d’une procédure de CHIP chez la souris.
Matériels et méthodes
Afin de développer notre modèle, nous avons d’abord déterminé les conditions optimales de la CHIP chez les souris Black Six sans carcinose. Pour évaluer la morbidité de la CHIP, des cellules de carcinose péritonéale d’origine ovarienne ont été injectées dans le péritoine de souris Nude. Les souris ont subi une CHIP 21jours plus tard sous anesthésie générale. Un cathéter d’entrée a été introduit dans l’hypochondrie gauche et un cathéter de sortie a été introduit dans la fosse iliaque gauche. Le bain de perfusion était de l’oxaliplatine (920mg/m2) à 43°C pendant 12minutes. Les souris ont été surveillées et sacrifiées deux semaines après la procédure.
Résultats
Aucun décès n’a été observé au cours de la procédure et la perfusion a bien été tolérée. Une souris est décédée le lendemain de la procédure. Aucune déshydratation majeure, hémopéritoine ou éviscération n’a été observée.
Conclusion
Ce modèle de CHIP sur souris à abdomen fermé a une morbidité faible et pourrait être utile pour étudier les paramètres de la CHIP et ses effets sur la carcinose péritonéale.
Summary
Aim of the study
We set out to develop and evaluate the morbidity of a non-invasive hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) procedure in mice. HIPEC has been shown to improve overall survival in treating ovarian cancer with peritoneal carcinomatosis. However, related complications, toxicity and the lack of randomized trials limits its widespread use. To improve the surgical technique, there is a need for animal models that allow teams to work on large groups without burdensome logistics.
Materials and methods
To develop the model, we first determined optimal HIPEC conditions in 20 Black Six mice without carcinomatosis. To evaluate HIPEC morbidity, peritoneal carcinomatosis cells of ovarian origin were injected into the peritoneum of 10 pathogen-free Nude mice. The mice underwent HIPEC 21 days later under general anesthesia. An inflow catheter was introduced into the left hypochondria and an outflow catheter was introduced into the left iliac fossa. Bath infusion was oxaliplatin (920mg/m2) at 43°C for 12minutes. The mice were monitored and sacrificed two weeks after the procedure.
Results
No deaths were observed during the procedure and infusion was well tolerated throughout the HIPEC. One mouse died the day after the procedure. No major dehydration, hemoperitoneum or evisceration were observed.
Conclusion
This mouse model of closed abdomen HIPEC has limited morbidity and could be a useful model to study HIPEC regimens and its effects on peritoneal carcinomatosis.}

abstract = {Background: Patients (pts) with refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) have poor outcomes with currently available therapies, with a complete response (CR) rate of 8%, a partial response (PR) rate of 18%, and median overall survival (OS) of 6.6 months (mo) as demonstrated in the 635 pt SCHOLAR-1 meta-analysis (Crump, ASCO 2016; abstract 7516). ZUMA-1 is the first multicenter trial of anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells in refractory, aggressive NHL (NCT02348216). The phase 1 portion of ZUMA-1 showed ongoing CRs at 12+ mos in 43% of pts (Locke, ESMO 2016; abstract 1048O). The pivotal phase 2 portion of ZUMA-1 comprises 2 cohorts based on tumor type: DLBCL (cohort 1) and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma or transformed follicular lymphoma (cohort 2). Here, we present results of a prespecified interim analysis from cohort 1. Methods: Pts received a target dose of 2 × 106 anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg after a low-dose conditioning regimen of cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2) and fludarabine (30 mg/m2) daily for 3 days. The primary endpoint is objective response rate (ORR) per 2007 IWG criteria. Key secondary endpoints include duration of response, frequency of adverse events (AEs), and levels of CAR T cells and serum cytokines. Key inclusion criteria include age ≥18 years, ECOG performance status (PS) 0-1, and refractory disease defined as progressive disease or stable disease as best response to last line of therapy, or disease progression ≤12 mos after autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). Pts must have received a prior anti-CD20 antibody and an anthracycline-containing regimen. A prespecified interim analysis was to be conducted to determine early efficacy with a nominal alpha level of 0.017 in 50 treated pts in cohort 1 with a minimum follow-up of 3 mos. Results: In total, 111 pts from 22 institutions were enrolled and leukapheresed, and 101 pts received KTE-C19. As of August 24, 2016, 51 pts in cohort 1 were eligible for analysis. Median age was 58 years (range, 25-76), 73% were male, 71% had ECOG PS 1, 78% were refractory to ≥2 lines of therapy, 20% relapsed ≤12 mos of ASCT, and 61% were treated with ≥3 lines of prior therapy. KTE-C19 was successfully manufactured in 99% of pts enrolled. Average turnaround time from apheresis to receipt of KTE-C19 at the clinical site was 17.4 days. With an ORR of 76%, the study met the primary endpoint (P<0.0001; exact binomial test comparing observed ORR to a historical control assumption of 20%), with 47% CRs and 29% PRs. 92% of responses occurred within the 1st mo, and 39% of pts had ongoing responses (CR in 33%) at 3 mos. Responses were seen across key covariates, including refractory subgroup (refractory to chemotherapy=76%, relapse post ASCT=80%). Kaplan-Meier estimates of progression-free survival at 1 and 3 mos were 92% and 56%, respectively. The most common grade ≥3 treatment-emergent AEs were neutropenia (67%), anemia (39%), thrombocytopenia (29%), febrile neutropenia (27%), and encephalopathy (24%). Grade ≥3 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic events occurred in 20% and 29% of pts, respectively. There was 1 grade 5 KTE-C19-related event of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. CAR T cells expanded within 14 days of KTE-C19 infusion, and peak expansion was associated with ongoing response at mo 3 (P=0.008). Pts who developed grade ≥3 neurological events had increased serum levels of IL-15 (P=0.0002), IL-6 (P=0.003); IL-10 (P=0.009) and IP-10 (P=0.0003). Cytokines/chemokines returned to baseline levels in most pts by day 28. Data from 93 pts with at least 1 mo of follow-up at the data cutoff will be presented. Conclusions: ZUMA-1 is the first reported multicenter trial of CAR T cell therapy in pts with refractory aggressive NHL. KTE-C19 induced a nearly 6-fold higher CR rate compared to historical outcomes in SCHOLAR-1. Efficacy strongly associated with peak CAR T levels. Central manufacturing, logistics, and AE management were successfully implemented across 22 sites, most with no prior CAR T therapy experience. Results from cohort 2 of ZUMA-1 are also presented (Abstract #998). KTE-C19 demonstrated significant clinical benefit in pts with no curative treatment options. Supported in part by funding from The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society Therapy Acceleration Program®. Drs Neelapu and Locke contributed equally to this study.

abstract = {Background
The Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) is one of the most widely used laboratory stress tests. Exposure to this psychosocial stressor has been shown to stimulate an acute cortisol stress response in the majority of healthy individuals, while deviations from the typical pattern, i.e., cortisol reactivity dysfunctions have been linked to an ever-increasing number of negative health outcomes. However, significant variability between labs exists in strength of observed cortisol responses in healthy individuals. This variability raises the question of how to distinguish across labs between cortisol stress response patterns that reflect health risk from those that are due to methodological differences. Thus, we propose a systematic review and meta-analysis that aims at quantifying the effects of methodological variation in study and TSST protocol elements on cortisol stress responses in healthy individuals.
Methods
Literature searches were conducted using standard databases for English language with key words including Trier Social Stress Test, TSST, Cortisol, and Laboratory Stressor among others. 186 studies met our inclusion criteria of healthy human participants without systemic immunological or endocrine dysfunction and provided sufficient information to compute a total of 237 sub-sample effect sizes.
Results and discussion
With regard to study protocol variations that may risk confounding baseline cortisol values and thus influence subsequent reactivity measures, meta-analytical examination revealed that acclimation periods pre-TSST below 30 or perhaps even 15min may suffice, at least as long as no interfering activities, i.e., questionnaires, are taking place during that timeframe. Assessing the effects of TSST protocol variations on cortisol response strength, several observations are noteworthy. First, shortening speech preparation time did not change cortisol responses in any way, nor did including questionnaires during that period show an effect. As such, our findings suggest that speech preparation time is one TSST element that can be used to reduce the burden for participants as well as laboratory logistics. Secondly, having an all female panel and instructing panel members to show negative instead of neutral behavior towards the participants both were associated with considerably reduced cortisol stress response strengths. Thirdly, several variables of interest, such as content of the speech task or gender match between active panel member and participant, were problematic to evaluate due to the large number of studies not reporting those details. This calls for future studies to report more details regarding potentially relevant protocol specifications.}

abstract = {Context
The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) has numerous applications in real life. It clarifies in a wide area of transportation and distribution such as transportation of individuals and items, conveyance service and garbage collection. Thus, an appropriate selecting of vehicle routing has an extensive influence role to improve the economic interests and appropriateness of logistics planning.
Problem
In this study the problem is as follows: Universiti Tenaga Nasional (UNITEN) has eight buses which are used for transporting students within the campus. Each bus starts from a main location at different times every day. The bus picks up students from eight locations inside the campus in two different routes and returns back to the main location at specific times every day, starting from early morning until the end of official working hours, on the following conditions: Every location will be visited once in each route and the capacity of each bus is enough for all students included in each route.
Objectives
Our paper attempt to find an optimal route result for VRP of UNITEN by using genetic algorithm. To achieve an optimal solution for VRP of UNITEN with the accompanying targets: To reduce the time consuming and distance for all paths. which leads to the speedy transportation of students to their locations, to reduce the transportation costs such as fuel utilization and additionally the vehicle upkeep costs, to implement the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) model for optimizing UNITEN’s shuttle bus services. To implement the algorithm which can be used and applied for any problems in the like of UNITEN VRP.
Approach
The Approach has been presented based on two phases: firstly, find the shortest route for VRP to help UNITEN University reduce student’s transportation costs by genetic algorithm is used to solve this problem as it is capable of solving many complex problems; secondly, identify The CVRP model is implemented for optimizing UNITEN shuttle bus services.
Finding
The findings outcome from this study have shown that: (1) A comprehensive listed of active GACVRP; (2) Identified and established an evaluation criterion for GACVRP of UNITEN; (3) Highlight the methods, based on hybrid crossover operation, for selecting the best way (4) genetic algorithm finds a shorter distance for route A and route B. The proportion of reduction the distance for each route is relatively short, but the savings in the distance becomes greater when calculating the total distances traveled by all buses daily or monthly. This applies also to the time factor that has been reduced slightly based on the rate of reduction in the distances of the routes.}

abstract = {Many researchers and scholars do not know that the total costs to obtain a patent are considerable and that the implementation of a logistics system and specific management to carry out the process successfully is required. The aim of this paper is to show, through empirical evidence, that patenting costs are considerable. The methodology is the analysis of selected and representative cases of the total costs over the project routes, incurred by an R&D Center of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), during the processes performed to obtain patents for some academic inventions. The findings are that the costs that were incurred to obtain two national patents were quite significant, but much more in the case of patent applications abroad, either by direct application or through the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT). We also found that the process time takes an average of three to six years, depending on the type of patent application. Finally, the costs shown could be considered as reference costs for budget preparation. Nevertheless, the process does not guarantee obtaining patent titles in all cases.
Resumen
Muchos investigadores y académicos desconocen que los costos para solicitar y obtener una patente son considerables y que se requiere de la implantación de un sistema logístico y de administración especializado para llevar a cabo el proceso con éxito. El objetivo de este trabajo es mostrar que los costos de patentar no son bajos a través de evidencia empírica. La metodología es el análisis de casos seleccionados y representativos de los costos vertidos en las rutas de tiempo en los que incurrió un Centro de investigación y desarrollo de la Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM) durante los procesos de patentamiento para algunas invenciones seleccionadas. Los hallazgos son, que los costos en los que se incurrió para obtener patentes nacionales y patentes solicitadas en el extranjero, tanto por solicitud directa, como a través del Tratado de Cooperación en materia de Patentes (PCT) fueron significativos. También encontramos que el proceso, desde que se somete la solicitud, hasta la obtención del título, tomará entre tres a seis años en promedio, dependiendo del tipo de patente solicitada. Finalmente, los costos mostrados se pueden considerar como costos de referencia para la realización de presupuestos, aunque se debe considerar que no en todos los casos en los que se solicite una patente, se obtendrá el título.}

abstract = {The aim of the present study is to understand contractual relations through the complementarity of the Transaction Costs Theory, Measurement Costs Theory, and the Resource-Based View. Initially, we sought to define an analytical model appropriate to the complementarity objective, considering the categories of each approach. The proposition was: given the possibility of measuring the attributes of products, the contractual relationship can be used to guarantee property rights over assets of high specificity and strategic value, avoiding the costs of vertical integration. Secondly, a qualitative descriptive cross-cut (2014 and 2015) study was carried out. In this phase, the complementarity proposition was analyzed based on data obtained through semi-structured interviews with logistics, production, and purchasing managers of automakers located in the state of Paraná, and some of their direct suppliers. Our proposition indicates that when there is the possibility of measuring product attributes, the contractual relationship can be used to secure property rights of high-specificity assets and strategic resources, avoiding the costs of vertical integration. This proposition was verified because, in the case of high-specificity auto parts, the measurability of their dimensions ensures protection of specific and residual property rights. In the case of strategic resources, when there is a possibility of measurement and control, contracting is allowed, even including the acquisition of innovations that bring competitive advantage (Bluetooth, integrated GPS with SD card, back-up sensor, air bags). It was observed that, even though competitive advantages constitute valuable and rare resources for automakers at their launch, this did not prevent contracting. Verification can offer an alternative path to rational Transaction Costs Theory, as proposed by Williamson, and the use of vertical integration as a form of controlling strategic resources, recommended by the Resource-Based View, which still requires further studies in order to overcome persistent limitations in the model.
Resumo
Neste artigo, objetivou-se compreender as relações contratuais por meio da complementaridade da Teoria dos Custos de Transação, Teoria dos Custos de Mensuração e Visão Baseada em Recursos. Para tanto, buscou-se definir um modelo analítico adequado ao objetivo de complementaridade, considerando-se as categorias de cada abordagem. A proposição elaborada indica que, na possibilidade de mensuração dos atributos dos produtos, a relação contratual pode ser utilizada para garantir os direitos de propriedade sobre ativos de elevada especificidade e recursos estratégicos, evitando-se os custos da integração vertical. Em um segundo momento, a partir de uma pesquisa qualitativa descritiva, com recorte no ano de 2015, realizou-se a fase empírica da proposta. Nessa fase, analisou-se a proposição de complementaridade a partir de dados obtidos por meio de entrevistas semiestruturadas com gerentes de logísticas, produção e compras das montadoras automotivas localizadas no Estado do Paraná, e alguns de seus fornecedores diretos. A proposição foi ratificada ao se constatar que, no caso de autopeças de elevada especificidade, a capacidade de mensuração de suas dimensões garante a proteção de direitos de propriedade específicos e residuais. No caso dos recursos estratégicos, na possibilidade de mensuração e controle, a contratação permitiu a aquisição de diversas inovações geradoras de vantagem competitiva (bluetooth, o GPS integrado no veiculo, com cartão SD, o sensor de ré, air bags). Observou-se que, mesmo se constituindo em recursos valiosos e raros para as montadoras no seu lançamento, esse fato não impediu que esses fossem adquiridos por intermédio da contratação. Conclui-se que essa ratificação pode oferecer um caminho alternativo ao racional da TCT, proposto por Williamson, e à orientação pela integração de recursos, como forma de controle, preconizado pela VBR, o que ainda carece de maiores estudos visando a superar as limitações ainda presentes no modelo apresentado.

IMPL is both a structural and semantic language with its concepts, constructs and configurations of the Unit-Operation-Port-State Superstructure (UOPSS) and the terms and details of its Quantity-Logic-Quality Phenomena (QLQP). This forum is primarily intended to discuss problems found in the Batch and Continuous Process Industries when solving design, planning, scheduling, optimization, control, parameter estimation, data reconciliation and simulation examples although interesting and suitable instances found in other industries are also welcome and encouraged. By extensively performing industrial applications around research and development types of initiative, we provide industrial modeling frameworks (IMF) as a jump-start to an industrial project implementation since it can be easily enhanced, extended, customized, modified, etc. to meet the diverse needs of your project and as it evolves over time and use. IMF’s also provide graphical user interface prototypes for drawing the flowsheet and typical Gantt charts and trend plots to view the solution of quantity, logic and quality time-profiles. Current developments use Python integrated with open-source Gnome Dia and Matplotlib modules respectively, but other prototypes embedded within Microsoft Excel/VBA for example can be created in a straightforward manner. The primary purpose of the IMF’s is to provide a timely, cost-effective, manageable and maintainable deployment of applications to formulate and optimize complex industrial manufacturing systems in either off-line or on-line environments. Using IMPL alone would be somewhat similar (but not as bad) to learning the syntax and semantics of an AML (Algebraic Modeling Language), although in IMPL there is no needs of coding all of the necessary mathematical representations of the problem including the details of digitizing your data into time-points and periods, demarcating past, present and future time-horizons, defining sets, index-sets, compound-sets to traverse the network or topology, calculating independent and dependent parameters to be used as coefficients and bounds and finally creating all of the necessary variables and constraints to model the complex details of logistics (discrete) and quality (nonlinear) industrial optimization problems. Therefore, IMF’s and IMPL give to the end-user, in our opinion, a more elegant and structured approach to industrial modeling and solving so that you can capture the benefits of advanced decision-making faster, better and cheaper. Upon agreement to join in the community of the industrial optimization and estimation applications, all model and/or problem data used with the free training license of IMPL must be made available to the OpenIMPL initiative. As such, it is the sole responsibility of the academic, non-commercial and/or home user to ensure that the model and/or problem data can be released and shared publicly.}

abstract = {During their lifecycles, buildings are changed and adapted to the requirements of generations of users, residents and proprietaries over several decades. At the end of their life time, buildings undergo either retrofit or deconstruction (and replacement) processes. And, modifications and deviations of the original building structure, equipment and fittings as well as the deterioration and contamination of buildings are often not well documented or only available in an outdated and unstructured way. Thus, in many existing buildings, incomplete, obsolete or fragmented building information is predominating and hampering retrofit and deconstruction project planning. To plan change or deconstruction measures in existing buildings, buildings are audited manually or with stationary laser scans which requires great effort of skilled staff and expensive equipment. Furthermore, current building information models or deconstruction planning systems are often not able to deal with incomplete building information as it occurs in existing buildings. We develop a combined system named ResourceApp of a hardware sensor with software modules for building information acquisition, 3D reconstruction, object detection, building inventory generation and optimized project planning. The mobile and wearable system enables planner, experts or decision makers to inspect a building and at the same time record, analyze, reconstruct and store the building digitally. For this purpose, a Kinect sensor acquires point clouds and developed algorithms analyze them in real-time to detect construction elements. From this information, a 3D building model and building inventory is automatically derived. Then, the generated building reconstruction information is used for optimized project planning with a solution algorithm of the multi-mode resource-constrained project scheduling problem (MRCPSP) at hand. In contrast to existing approaches, the system allows mobile building recording during building walkthrough, real-time reconstruction and object detection. And, based on the automatically captured and processed building conditions by sensor data, the system performs an integrated project planning of the building deconstruction with available resources and the required decontamination and deconstruction activities. Furthermore, it optimizes time and cost considering secondary raw material recovery, usage of renewable resources, staff qualification, onsite logistics, material storage and recycling options. Results from field tests on acquisition, reconstruction and deconstruction planning are presented and discussed in an extensive non-residential case study. The case study shows that the building inventory masses are quite well approximated and project planning works well based on the chosen methods. Nevertheless, future testing and parameter adjustment for the automated data processing is needed and will further improve the systems' quality, effectiveness and accuracy. Future research and application areas are seen in the quantification and analysis of the effects of missing data, the integration of material classification and sampling sensors into the system, the system connection to Building Information Modelling (BIM) software via a respective interface and the transfer and extension to retrofit project planning.}

abstract = {Biomass is available from many sources or can be mass-produced. Moreover, biomass has a high energy-generation potential, produces less toxic emissions than some other fuels, is mostly carbon neutrality, and burns easily. Biomass has been widely utilized as a raw material in thermal chemical conversion, replacing coal and oil, including power generation. Biomass firing and co-firing in pulverized coal boilers, fluidized bed boilers, and grate furnaces or stokerfed boilers have been developed around the world because of the worsening environmental problems and developing energy crisis. However, many issues hinder the efficient and clean utilization of biomass in energy applications. They include preparation, firing and co-firing, and ash-related issues during and after combustion. In particular, ash-related issues, including alkali-induced slagging, silicate melt-induced slagging (ash fusion), agglomeration, corrosion, and ash utilization, are among the most challenging problems. The current review provides a summary of knowledge and research developments concerning these ash-related issues. It also gives an in-depth analysis and discussion on the formation mechanisms, urgent requirements, and potential countermeasures including the use of additives, co-firing, leaching, and alloying. Alkali species, particularly alkali chlorides and sulfates, cause alkali-induced slagging during biomass combustion. Thus, the mechanisms of generation, transformation, and sequestration of alkali species and the formation and growth of alkali-induced slagging, formed as an alternating overlapping multi-layered structure, are discussed in detail. For silicate melt-induced slagging (ash fusion), the evolutions of chemical composition of both the elements and minerals in the ash during combustion and existing problems in testing are overviewed. Pseudo-4D phase diagrams of (Ma2O)-MaeO-P2O5-Al2O3 and (Ma2O)-MaeO-SiO2-Al2O3 are proposed as effective tools to predict ash fusion characteristics and the properties of melt-induced slagging. Concerning agglomeration that typically occurs in fluidized bed furnaces, melt-induced and coating-induced agglomeration and coating-forming mechanisms are highlighted. Concerning corrosion, seven corrosion mechanisms associated with Cl2, gaseous, solid/deposited, and molten alkali chlorides, molten alkali sulfates and carbonates, and the sulfation/silication of alkali chlorides are comprehensively reviewed. The effects of alloying, salt state (solid, molten, or gaseous), combustion atmosphere, and temperature are also discussed systematically. For ash utilization, potential approaches to the use of fly ash, bottom ash, and biomass/coal co-fired ash as construction and agricultural materials are explored. Several criteria or evaluation indexes are introduced for alkali-induced slagging and agglomeration, and chemical equilibrium calculation and multicomponent phase diagrams of silicate melt-induced slagging and agglomeration. Meanwhile, remedies, including the use of additives, co-firing, leaching, alloying, and the establishment of regulations, are discussed. It is suggested that considerable attention should be focused on an understanding of the kinetics of alkali chemistry, which is essential for the transformation and sequestration of alkali species. A combination of heterogeneous chemical kinetics and multiphase equilibrium modeling is critical to estimating the speciation, saturation levels, and the presence of melt of the ash-forming matter. Further practical evaluation and improvement of the existing criterion numbers of alkali-induced slagging and agglomeration should be improved. The pseudo-4D phase diagrams of (Ma2O)-MaeO-P2O5-Al2O3 and (Ma2O)-MaeO-SiO2-Al2O3 should be constructed from the data derived from real biomass ashes rather than those of simulated ashes in order to provide the capability to predict the properties of silicate melt-induced slagging. Apart from Cr, research should be conducted to understand the effects of Si, Al, and Co, which exhibit high corrosion resistance, and heavy metals such as Zn and Pb, which may form low-melting chlorides that accelerate corrosion. Regulations, cooperation among biomass-fired power plants and other industries, potential technical research, and logistics should be strengthened to enable the extensive utilization of biomass ash. Finally, alkali-induced slagging, silicate melt-induced slagging, agglomeration, and corrosion occur concurrently, and thus, these issues should be investigated jointly rather than separately.}

abstract = {Every year the transport of dangerous goods amounts to more than 154 billion tonne-km on European roads, railways and inland waterways (source: Eurostat http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu, year 2013). When speaking about dangerous goods movement, traceability and monitoring are not only a matter of an intelligent and efficient logistics. They also imply aspects related to security and safety, being a concern common to involved industries and authorities. For this reason, tracking & tracing the shipment of dangerous goods requires an efficient collection of timely and precise information about the various operations. Besides, reliability is a fundamental requirement, especially in the case of intermodal transport where different operators and modalities are involved. About 85% of the shrinkage in the overall supply chain occurs while materials, components or finished goods are in transit. In this respect, the satellite navigation technology is a key element, as it enables:•The continuous localization, control and monitoring of goods traffic during transport.•The collection of data to be further analysed for statistical reporting and incident prevention. Systems based on the use of satellite positioning are today widely adopted in the transport of dangerous goods operations. Tracking & tracing devices (installed on board of the asset transporting the goods) can also integrate sensors to enable the monitoring of the status of the goods and different telecommunication means (satellite and/or terrestrial) for positions/data transmission. Various past and on-going European initiatives are also introducing the use of the European satellite navigation (EGNSS, European Global Navigation Satellite System), starting from EGNOS (European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service) and in view of Galileo. Among these initiatives, the project SCUTUM (SeCUring the EU GNSS adopTion in the dangeroUs Material transport, www.scutumgnss.eu) concluded in 2011, exhaustively and successfully demonstrated that EGNOS provides precise and reliable localization and tracking, and thus it is particularly suitable for monitoring the transport of dangerous goods. Today, thanks to SCUTUM, EGNOS is used to monitor around 1,200 road tankers transporting dangerous goods by road in Europe (Italy, France, Austria, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Czech Republic). Capitalizing on SCUTUM's achievements, the on-going project CORE, started in 2014 and with a duration of 4 years, is extending the use of EGNOS to the intermodal transport of dangerous goods, and analysing the advantages of the introduction of Galileo. As done in SCUTUM, also CORE is expected to launch an operational best practice in Europe. Moreover, similarly to SCUTUM, the project's results will feed the on-going UNECE OTIF WG (United Nations Economic Commission for Europe Organisation Intergouvernementale pour les Transports Internationaux Ferroviaires Working Group) on Telematics in relation to the use of telematics for the transport of dangerous goods, specifically for what the EGNSS is concerned.}

abstract = {Giant reed (Arundo donax L.) is a C3 perennial rhizomatous grass belonging to the Gramineae family, originating in Asia and later spreading to different subtropical wetlands and warm-temperature regions of Europe, Africa, North America, and Oceania. A wide range of yields is reported in the literature depending on the site, climate, soil type and fertility, inputs, cultivation and harvest practices, and age of plantation. Although it produces flowers, seeds are not fertile. Consequently, its propagation is carried out mainly by rhizomes or stem cuttings. Giant reed has an uncommonly high photosynthetic capacity as compared to other C3 species, and is very similar to those of C4 species. It is able to achieve high photosynthetic rates, up to ∼38μmol CO2 m−2s−1 in well-watered treatments, but with substantial transpiration, leading to low or at least lower water use efficiency than many C4 crops (1.19–2.47gkg−1), but is still more efficient than most C3 species. Radiation use efficiency increases proportionally as nitrogen and available water are increased, and can range from 1.26 to 2.02gMJ−1, although higher values of 5.74gMJ−1-intercepted photosynthetically active radiation are also reported. These are much lower than miscanthus, a typical C4 species. Nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) can range from 168.4 to 467gg−1; single and late harvests, young plantations, and low nitrogen rates lead to increased NUE. Giant reed is also considered as a moderately saline-sensitive plant as it was able to maintain >50% of its relative growth when salinity was <12dSm−1. The response of giant reed to N fertilization is expected to be minimal or even zero, as long as the soil nitrogen availability, the rhizomes reserves, and other N inputs are sufficient to supply the uptakes. On the other hand, irrigation plays a significant role in increased dry matter yields, being 30.0%–40.0% higher in well-watered than in rainfed conditions. However, giant reed can also be considered as a drought-resistant crop. The harvest of A. donax is fully mechanized. The choice of a harvest method over another is determined by several parameters, such as crop status, biomass moisture content at harvest, logistics, availability of equipment and type of storage, required biomass quality, and final use. Fuel characteristics of the harvested material, such as calorific value (17–18.8MJ), ash (5.3%–8.1%) content of stems as well as its cellulose (43.4%), hemicellulose (25.1%–29.2%), and lignin (10.6%) content can be considered satisfactory for the production of energy, biogas, advanced biofuels, paper, and pulp. Recently, interest has been concentrated on the production of fuels, chemicals, and other products of high added value within a multiproduct biorefinery.}

abstract = {Introduction: Non-stem cell therapies including cellular vaccines and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells are experiencing explosive growth in research development and clinical applications. Demand is growing, with several CAR products heading for imminent FDA approval. The variety of products poses a challenge to even experienced cancer centers. Our goal was to create clinical and operational infrastructure to deliver these therapies efficiently and safely. We leveraged existing workflows and care models spanning inpatient and outpatient settings and disease groups previously unfamiliar with cell therapies. Methods: We conducted over 30 internal stakeholder interviews across research, cell processing, nursing, physician, pharmacy, and operational areas and queried experts at other cell-engineering sites. Key areas identified were 1) cell distribution, 2) trial initiation, 3) communication, training, and clinical care, 4) resource utilization, and 5) safety and outcome monitoring. A steering committee formulated guiding principles: make safety paramount, systematically coordinate care, recognize each cell therapy and sponsor's unique requirements, and minimize unnecessary infrastructure. Aspects of the care spectrum evaluated spanned from patient identification, financial clearance, outpatient workup, cell collection, admission/administration, to post-infusion follow-up. Results: 1) Cell distribution: despite product manufacturing at central contracted sites, novel internal workflows were required to ensure chain of identity through multiple hand-offs. A standard questionnaire was devised to determine unique trial hurdles and a consistent approach to labeling, shipping and communication with sponsors and clinicians. Biweekly meetings between apheresis, cell processing, nursing, and pharmacy staff to discuss logistics and impediments were established. (Figure) 2) Trial initiation: A "start up kit" was developed to explain key entities and workflows (e.g. apheresis, pharmacy for tocilizumab, biosafety review) to help investigators unfamiliar with cell therapies navigate submission. 3) Communication, training and clinical care: guidance in budget design, tools to flag high-risk patients in electronic medical records (EMR), and education on nomenclature were developed. Over 20 general education sessions were conducted across clinical and operational areas, in addition to trial-specific training, for financial coordinators, patient safety groups, MDs, residents, PAs and nurses in all disease areas both inpatient and outpatient, even statisticians. We created email distribution lists, EMR flags, a case management system, and toxicity management order sets to ensure awareness of admissions, availability of crucial medications, recognition of cytokine release or neurotoxicity requiring unique intervention, and priming of ICU resources. A weekly forum for MDs and clinical stakeholders to share clinical events and needs was instituted. 4) Resource utilization: shortfalls were identified in cell-collection capacity and scheduling, product distribution, and clinical expertise. Dedicated clinician positions were created, and scheduling was consolidated to optimize capacity within and outside existing BMT infrastructure. 5) Safety and outcome monitoring: a format and forum was developed for quarterly review of major outcomes allowing institutional oversight over the spectrum of investigational cell therapies and standard of care administrations. Discussion: With the explosion in outpatient cancer vaccines and CAR T cells, the need for additional physical resources, new medications, experienced clinicians, and communication tools became evident. We describe our approach to creating novel workflows to ensure patients receive the latest cell therapies safely, timely distribution of cells, educated ED and ICU involvement, and rapid expert management including anti-cytokine therapy. The investment of individual centers to bring cellular therapies safely into clinical care should not be under-appreciated, particularly given the high-risk nature of these treatments and the unique processes and high-coordinated activities these new modalities require. Regulatory agencies, such as FACT, are likewise requesting that such safety measures, standard procedures and oversight be addressed.

abstract = {Planning of the transport system is usually based on forecasting of future traffic volumes. The forecast is based on current trends in the society, predictions of future economic growth and costs of transport. In all parts of Europe these trends and models point towards further growth of transport and traffic volumes. The highest growth is predicted in the Eastern part where car ownership is getting closer to the levels in the Western part. Safety factors and seamless mobility can justify improved road network but the forecasts also indicate a need for larger roads with more capacity. These new roads not only induce more traffic and thereby more emissions of GHG but also larger energy use and emissions of GHG during construction, operation and maintenance. In the last report IPCC warns that infrastructure developments that lock societies into GHG-intensive emissions pathways may be difficult or very costly to change. This reinforces the importance of early action for ambitious mitigation. To reach the climate objectives there is a need for technical solutions in energy efficient vehicles partly or fully dependent on electricity and a replacement of fossil fuels with bio fuels. These solutions however are not enough. There is also a need to change direction in planning and development of society and infrastructure in accordance with behavioral changes. It is a clear paradigm shift from planning for more traffic with cars and trucks towards a more sustainable mobility with accessibility through walking, cycling and public transport with less cars and improved logistics and modal shift instead of more trucks. Under such conditions of paradigm shift forecast is a very unreliable method. So there is a need for other methods. This paper is a result of the work within the CEDR I4 group on mitigation and adaptation to climate change. Based on examples from Sweden, Norway, Hungary and Poland within the group the paper explores an alternative method for planning. The first step is to describe the current situation, what the trends are and what the drivers are, to get a general picture of the problem. A clear objective is also needed. Since most countries do not have precise GHG objectives for road transport example is given how national objectives can be translated to a road transport objective. Then the gap between the trend and the GHG objectives can be described for road transport. An inventory should be made of possible measures to reduce the GHG emissions. This has been done in many countries and by EU commission which can work as a basis, but update may be necessary and there should be space for new ideas. The measures can be clustered into packages. From them scenarios can be built and tested towards the GHG objectives and other targets. Backcasting from the scenarios that fulfill the objectives can be used to develop an implementation strategy with policy instruments and measures to move in the direction towards the objectives. Due to uncertainty check points are recommended some years in between to adjust the strategy.}

Introducción y objetivos
El empleo de doble mamaria se ha asociado con un aumento de complicaciones esternales, especialmente en pacientes diabéticos y obesos. El objetivo de este trabajo es revisar los factores de riesgo de aquellos pacientes en los que se ha usado doble mamaria y la tasa de complicación esternal en este grupo.
Métodos
De nuestra base de datos se ha seleccionado a 526 pacientes revascularizados quirúrgicamente con uso de doble arteria mamaria. La edad media de los pacientes fue de 59 años, con un EuroScore logístico-1 medio de 2,7%.
Resultados
Presentaron dehiscencia esternal 3 pacientes (0,57%), no se correlacionó con ningún factor de riesgo. Problemas de herida tanto superficial como profunda 31 pacientes (5.9%), (2 mediastinitis-0.38%). Con respecto a los pacientes que presentaron infección superficial de la herida quirúrgica (29 pacientes, 5,513%), se obtuvo mayor incidencia en mujeres, pacientes con insuficiencia renal y aquellos a los que se les realizó transfusión de concentrado de hematíes en quirófano, Siendo estas diferencias estadísticamente significativas (p<0,05). También hubo mayor incidencia de infección superficial en pacientes diabéticos, enfermedad pulmonar obstructiva crónica, obesos, fumadores y a aquellos a los que se les realizó revascularización miocárdica incompleta, siendo estas diferencias no significativas.
Conclusiones
En nuestra experiencia, la utilización de doble mamaria no se acompañó de mayor incidencia de dehiscencia esternal, pero si con problemas de infección superficial de la herida, sobre todo en el grupo de pacientes mujeres, con insuficiencia renal y transfundidos en quirófano. Para mantener el beneficio de la doble mamaria en estos pacientes, deberíamos ser especialmente cuidadosos e implementar nuevas estrategias de cierre esternal.
Introduction and objectives
The use of double internal mammary artery in coronary artery bypass grafting has been associated with increased sternal complications, especially in diabetic and obese patients. The aim of this article is to review the risk factors for those patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting with the use of double internal mammary artery and to analyse the sternal complication rate in this group.
Methods
A total 526 patients revascularized with use of double internal mammary artery were selected from our database. The mean age of the patients was 59 years, with a mean logistics EuroScore I of 2.7%.
Results
There were a total of 3 (0.57%) cases with sternal instability, which did not correspond with any risk factor. A sternal associated infection was observed in 31 (5.9%) patients, but only 2 of them developed deep infection/mediastinitis (0.38%). Of the patients who had superficial infection of the surgical wound (29 patients, 5.5%), there was a higher incidence in women, patients with renal failure, and those who received a transfusion of packed red blood cells during the surgery. These findings were statistically significant (P<.05). There was also a higher incidence (with no statistically significant differences) of superficial infection in patients with diabetes, COPD, obese, smokers, and those who underwent incomplete myocardial revascularisation.
Conclusions
In our experience, the use of double internal mammary artery was not accompanied by an increased incidence of sternal instability, but it was associated with superficial infections, in the group of female patients, renal disease, and those who needed red blood cells during the surgery. To maintain the benefit of the double internal mammary artery bypass grafting in these patients, special care should be taken, and new strategies for sternal closure should be implemented.}

abstract = {Along with the progress in computer hardware architecture and computational power, in order to overcome technological bottlenecks, software applications that make use of expert and intelligent systems must race against time where nanoseconds matter in the long-awaited future. This is possible with the integration of excellent solvers to software engineering methodologies that provide optimization-based decision support for planning. Since the logistics market is growing rapidly, the optimization of routing systems is of primary concern that motivates the use of vehicle routing problem (VRP) solvers as software components integrated as an optimization engine. A critical success factor of routing optimization is quality vs. response time performance. Less time-consuming and more efficient automated processes can be achieved by employing stronger solution algorithms. This study aims to solve the Vehicle Routing Problem with Simultaneous Pickup and Delivery (VRPSPD) which is a popular extension of the basic Vehicle Routing Problem arising in real world applications where pickup and delivery operations are simultaneously taken into account to satisfy the vehicle capacity constraint with the objective of total travelled distance minimization. Since the problem is known to be NP-hard, a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm based on an ant colony system (ACS) and a variable neighborhood search (VNS) is developed for its solution. VNS is a powerful optimization algorithm that provides intensive local search. However, it lacks a memory structure. This weakness can be minimized by utilizing long term memory structure of ACS and hence the overall performance of the algorithm can be boosted. In the proposed algorithm, instead of ants, VNS releases pheromones on the edges while ants provide a perturbation mechanism for the integrated algorithm using the pheromone information in order to explore search space further and jump from local optima. The performance of the proposed ACS empowered VNS algorithm is studied on well-known benchmarks test problems taken from the open literature of VRPSPD for comparison purposes. Numerical results confirm that the developed approach is robust and very efficient in terms of both solution quality and CPU time since better results provided in a shorter time on benchmark data sets is a good performance indicator.}

abstract = {Traded volumes – from raw materials to final consumer goods through intermediary products – are projected to continue growing in the foreseeable future: sheer domestic EU and global competition will impose challenging requirements to providing innovative supply-chain and logistics solutions, including not only smart business models but also smart and foresighted infrastructural planning and management capacities. Public planning and funding face critical limitations, such as: (i) not duly accounting for the induced pressures on inland transportation infrastructure allowing access from/to the port to/from interesting trade links/destinations; (ii) not duly accounting for indirect costs and benefits resulting from either new infrastructural developments or re-deployment of existing infrastructures, and (iii) not duly accounting for the impacts of ports on the cities in which they are localised. Fragmented projections and impact assessments lead to sub-optimal economic performance of multi-modal terminals, the transportation network and the area they impact on increasing the risk of depleting initial investments or requiring on-going/permanent – public support, including to overcome local negative impacts. This article has two main purposes. On the one hand, it strives to identify shortcomings that hinder the achievement of expected benefits on urban and regional growth linked to port activity expansion. It is not based on a comprehensive analysis of case studies but on literature review and for that reason limiting factors mentioned in the article are not necessarily suited to specific situations. On the other hand, the article proposes a reflection on the relevant analytical and policy intervention tools having the potential to tackle and – ideally – resolve shortcomings. It advocates that a wider use of such tools would enhance the efficiency of handling freight volumes through ports and onto surface transport corridors maximizing positive spillover effects while minimizing nuisances and drawbacks for the urban and regional areas concerned. Congestion reduction in and around port areas and enhanced competitiveness are the expected results from balanced multimodal transport solutions. Many benefits are associated with efficient ports yet there tends to be a mismatch with gains spilling over to other regions and negative impacts borne locally. This area of research is expected to become all the more relevant in view of growing size of ships and therefore reduced number of ports/operators capable of handling those as well as higher induced pressure on – often already congested – inland transportation corridors. Conversely, development of the Motorways of the Sea and implementation of Short Sea Shipping foresee the increased use of medium and small ports to relieve the heavy burden on land transport, but this implies revised shipping patterns as well as overcoming fragmentation in transport infrastructure planning.}

Introduction et objectifs
La consommation de chlorure de sodium (sel) chez l’enfant est supérieure aux recommandations et, du fait de son retentissement sur la pression artérielle, sa réduction est un objectif de santé publique. C’est une mesure efficace chez l’enfant, avec la possibilité d’une prolongation de l’effet à l’âge adulte. L’objectif principal de l’étude était de diminuer d’environ 20 % la teneur en sel des menus de trois restaurants scolaires (écoles maternelles et primaires) de la ville de Limoges.
Matériels et méthodes
L’intervention, menée par un réseau de santé, comportait quatre phases : mesure des contenus en sel de trois repas successifs dans trois écoles, formations et discussions avec les personnels de cuisine et personnels en charge de la logistique alimentaire, interventions auprès des fournisseurs de denrées alimentaires industrielles, nouvelles mesures à distance des contenus en sel de trois repas successifs dans les mêmes établissements.
Résultats
Initialement, les contenus en sel des repas étaient dans tous les cas supérieurs aux apports recommandés pour un repas principal. Les formations étaient bien perçues et permettaient de confronter les pratiques et de faire 10 propositions d’action. Les interventions auprès des fournisseurs permettaient d’obtenir des denrées alimentaires moins salées. L’évaluation finale montrait une baisse des contenus en sel de 32,9 % pour les maternelles et de 32,3 % pour les primaires, et les contenus étaient très proches des valeurs recommandées.
Conclusion
Cette action a permis une réduction des contenus en sel dans des restaurants scolaires supérieure à l’objectif initial. Elle est la première décrite de ce type. Ceci suggère qu’une telle intervention peut-être une aide importante pour obtenir une baisse de la consommation journalière en sel chez l’enfant.
Introduction and objective
The consumption of sodium chloride (salt) in children is higher than the recommendations and, because of its impact on blood pressure; its reduction is a public health goal. This is a measure that seems effective in children, with the possibility of prolongation of the effect in adulthood. The main objective of the study was to reduce by approximately 20% the salt content of the menus of three school restaurants (nursery and primary schools) of the city of Limoges.
Materials and methods
The intervention, led by a health network, consisted of four phases: measuring the salt content of three successive meals in three schools, training and discussions with the kitchen staff and food logistics staff, interventions with food suppliers industrial foodstuffs, new remote measurements of the salt content of three successive meals in the same establishments.
Results
Initially, the salt content of the meals was in all cases higher than the recommended intake for a main meal. The trainings were well received and made it possible to confront the practices and to make 10 proposals of action. Interventions with suppliers made it possible to obtain less salty foods. The final evaluation showed a decrease in salt content of 32.9% for nursery and 32.3% for primary, and the contents were very close to the recommended values.
Conclusion
This action resulted in a reduction of salt content in school restaurants above the initial target. She is the first described of this type. This suggests that such an intervention can be an important aid in achieving a reduction in daily salt intake in children.}

El análisis probabilístico de datos hidrológicos extremos busca estimar predicciones confiables asociadas a altos periodos de retorno. Los momentos LH o de orden mayor, permiten caracterizar de una manera más eficiente la cola derecha de la función de distribución de probabilidades (FDP), al dar más importancia a los grandes valores de los datos. Usando los momentos LH se reduce la influencia indeseable que las magnitudes pequeñas de la muestra pueden tener en la estimación de las predicciones. En este trabajo se describe brevemente la teoría de los momentos L, como base para su generalización, lo cual conduce a los momentos LH, propuestos en 1997 por Wang Q.J. Se citan las ecuaciones que permiten estimar, con los métodos de momentos L y momentos LH, los tres parámetros de ajuste de las FDP: general de valores extremos (GVE), logística generalizada (LOG) y Pareto generalizada (PAG). Se realiza una aplicación numérica a los 21 registros disponibles de crecientes anuales de la Región Hidrológica Núm. 10 (Sinaloa), contrastando sus resultados con base en el error estándar de ajuste (EEA). El análisis de resultados mostró que la distribución PAG conduce a los mejores ajustes. También se observó que los momentos LH son una buena opción para abatir el EEA en las tres distribuciones utilizadas.
The probabilistic analysis of extreme hydrological data aims to estimate reliable predictions associated with high return periods. The LH or higher-order moments can characterize in a more efficient way the right tail of the probability distribution function (PDF), by giving more importance to large data values. The undesirable influence of the sample's small quantities is reduced by using the LH moments in the estimation of predictions. This paper briefly describes the theory of L moments, as a basis for its generalization, which leads to the LH moments, proposed in 1997 by Wang Q.J. By means of the L and LH moments methods, the equations that allow the estimation of the three fitting parameters of the PDF: General Extreme Values (GEV), Generalized Logistics (GLO) and Generalized Pareto (GPA) are cited. A numerical application to the 21 available records annual floods of Hydrological Region No. 10 (Sinaloa) is performed, contrasting its results based on the standard error of fit (SEF). The analysis of results showed that the GPA distribution leads to the best fittings. It can be highlighted that LH moments are a good choice to abate the SEF in the three distributions used.}

Varieties spaned grain, hay and grazing types, and ranged from 1301 to 1927°Cd from sowing to anthesis. Yield was measured in nine environments while other traits were measured in 4–7 out of the 9 environments. Averaged across varieties, yield varied from 0.3 to 4.2tha−1. The main environmental drivers of yield were water supply:demand from 500°Cd before to 500°Cd after anthesis, and minimum temperature in the same period. Phenotypic plasticity of yield, quantified as variance ratio, ranged from 0.60 to 1.22 for grain types and from 0.28 to 1.06 for their grazing and hay counterparts; high yield plasticity was associated with an asymmetric response to growing conditions: yield increased 3.3±0.28tha−1 per unit increase in plasticity under favourable conditions, and 0.6±0.16tha−1 per unit increase in plasticity under stress. For our combination of varieties and environments, genotypes were better discriminated in favourable environments, where selection for high plasticity would improve both yield potential and drought adaptation. After accounting for plasticity, yield residuals revealed consistent phenological thresholds (943°Cd for GS31, 1470°Cd for GS60) for adaptation to both favourable and stressful conditions. Yield correlated with leaf greenness (SPAD), particularly during grain fill. As expected from theory, yield was closely related to grains per m2 and weakly related to grain weight. Grains per m2 were negatively related to concentration of water soluble carbohydrates in shoots, which were in turn negatively correlated with shoot nitrogen concentration. Under favourable conditions, some varieties maintained a high concentration (>20%) of water soluble carbohydrates at harvest. Selection against this trait could improve yield potential, but residual labile carbohydrates can also be exploited in dual grain-feed varieties, and can provide flexibility for hay growers when logistics preclude cutting at the common water ripe (GS71) target.}

La transplantation pulmonaire (TP) est une option de traitement des patients atteints d’insuffisance respiratoire sévère avec haut risque de mortalité à deux ans. L’île de la Réunion ne possède pas de site apte à pratiquer cette activité.

Étude rétrospective de patients insuffisants respiratoires réunionnais, ayant fait l’objet d’un transfert en métropole pour transplantation pulmonaire. La sélection s’est effectuée de janvier 2005 à mai 2015. Vingt-neuf patients âgés de 14 à 64 ans ont été rapatriés en métropole. Treize cas de mucoviscidose, 13 cas de fibrose pulmonaire, 1 cas de dilatation des bronches, 1 cas de bronchopneumopathie obstructive chronique (BPCO) et 1 cas d’hypertension artérielle pulmonaire. Quinze patients ont pu être transplantés, parmi eux 9 sont toujours vivants, (4 vivent à la Réunion, 5 en métropole), 6 sont décédés. Un patient est sur liste d’attente, 3 sont décédés sur liste, 7 ont été récusés et 3 sont perdus de vue. Le nombre de patients adressés pour TP augmente sur 10 ans avec une incidence maximale en 2013 de 7 patients transférés dont 3 patients transplantés. La TP a pu être réalisée chez la moitié de nos patients avec un retour et un suivi post-transplantation envisageable sur l’île. Les indications suivent les tendances actuelles en dehors d’une sous-représentation de la BPCO.
Summary
Lung transplantation (LT) is a therapeutic option for patients with terminal respiratory failure and high risk of mortality in two years. Until now, this activity is not performed in Reunion Island. The candidate potential are thus directed to the metropolitan reference centres causing logistics and financials constraints. This work presents a current situation of the pulmonary transplantation in Reunion Island. This retrospective study includes patients from Reunion Island with respiratory insufficiency who have been transferred to metropolitan centres to apply to LT. The selection was made from January, 2005 till May, 2015. Twenty-nine patients included, aged from 14 to 64 years, were transferred to metropolitan France: 13 patients with cystic fibrosis, 13 patients with pulmonary fibrosis, 1 patients with bronchiectasis, 1 patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and 1 patient with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Fifteen patients underwent LT (4 live in Reunion Island, 5 live in metropolitan France and 6 are dead), 1 patient is alive on waiting list, 3 died on the waiting list, 7 patients were refused for transplantation and 3 patients are lost to follow-up. The number of patients transferred for LT increases over 10 years with a maximal incidence in 2013 of 7 repatriated patients including 3 transplanted patients. LT could be performed in half of our patients with possible come back and follow-up on Reunion Island. Indications follow the current trends except an under representation of COPD.}

abstract = {Introduction
The proportion of women engaged in clinical research has increased over time, but it is unclear if women and men contribute to the same extent during the conduct of research. Our objective were: –to describe the prevalence of women authors of original articles published in 2000 and 2015; –to compare the research contributions and author positions according to gender.
Methods
We conducted a repeated cross-sectional study among all original articles published in the Annals of Internal Medicine in 2000 and 2015. Participants were all authors listed on the byline of the original articles. The primary outcomes were 10 contributions listed at the end of the paper and included in the criteria of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICJME). Secondary outcomes were the author position on the byline (first, second, next-to-last and last compared to middle rank). The main exposures were the author gender and the year of publication (2000 or 2015). Other variables were the academic degrees mentioned by the author on the byline, the home institution, the country of affiliation, and the type of funding. We assessed the association and its evolution over time of the 10 specific contributions to research paper by using mixed effect logistic regression models (one per contribution) where the contribution was the dependent variable, the article was the random factor and the gender was the main fixed factor. In each model, we included the year and an interaction term between gender and year to assess change over time. We reassessed these associations after adjusting for academic degrees. To identify if gender was associated with a specific position on the article byline, we performed four conditional logistic regression models where each article defined a cluster, with author position (e.g. first vs. middle rank) as the dependent variable and gender the main predictor. We included year and an interaction term between year and gender to assess if there was a change over time of the associations between gender and author position. Then we adjusted the models for the 10 authors’ contributions to research. We built four models, comparing the first, second, next-to-last and last position to middle position. In these models, articles with four or less authors were excluded from the analyses.
Results
The proportion of women authors increased from 31.5% to 41.2% between 2000 and 2015 (P=0.004). In 2000, women authors were less frequently involved than men in the conception and design (55.1% vs. 61.2%, P=0.026), critical revision (70.4% vs. 80.7%, P=0.001), final approval (80.7% vs. 85.8%, P=0.038), and obtaining of funding (16.1% vs. 21.6%, P=0.024). Women tended to be more involved than men in administration and logistics (35.0% vs. 26.0%, P=0.019) and data collection (49.8% vs. 45.8%, P=0.053), but they were similarly involved in the analysis and interpretation of data, drafting of the manuscript, provision of materials/patients, and statistical expertise. Women were less often last authors than men (9.0% vs. 15.5%, P=0.016). These gender differences persisted in 2015.
Conclusions
The representation of women among authors of medical articles has increased notably between 2000 and 2015 but remained below 50%. Women's roles differed from those of men with no change over time. The study has some limitations with the use of a single journal and self-reported contributions. These differences may be due to justifiable reasons such as seniority, specific training and skills in research, or role preferences of the researchers. However, the possibility also exists that the academic research milieu perpetuates sexist attitudes and unequal treatment of researchers based solely on their gender. This requires further exploration, and justifies the continuation of local initiatives that promote women's involvement in research and ensure fair career opportunities, regardless of gender.}

abstract = {Summary
New developments in genetics and genomics offer a constant challenge to ethical reflection. One such development is the application of whole genome sequencing (WGS) as a diagnostic tool. The use of WGS in clinical practice carries with it the promise of personalized medicine, which will likely enable more efficient care and tailored prevention. However, the complexity and sheer amount of information involved may have significant implications for the patient-doctor relationship. The roles and expectations within this relationship are affected by both the institutional dimension of the logistics of handling genomic data and the changing possibilities of returning unsolicited or new information. As the relationship between doctor and patient changes under the influence of genomic data, the question emerges how the patient's rights may be safeguarded when the role and responsibility of the clinician shift. I argue that this question necessitates a rethinking of the authority of the patient in handling the flow of information in the clinical context. Specifically, I argue that the authority of the patient in personalized medicine should be shaped from a participant-centered perspective.
Résumé
Les nouveaux développements en génétique et en génomique offrent un défi constant à la réflexion éthique. Une de ces nouveautés est l’application de séquençage du génome entier (Whole Genome Sequencing [WGS]) comme outil de diagnostic. La possibilité de cartographier et d’analyser l’ensemble du génome d’un être humain est de plus en plus abordable pour diagnostiquer divers troubles. L’utilisation de WGS dans la pratique clinique porte donc avec elle la promesse d’une médecine personnalisée, qui pourra permettre des soins plus efficaces et une prévention plus adaptée. Je soutiendrai dans cet article que cette évolution nécessite de repenser les droits et les attentes de la relation médecin-patient. La complexité et la quantité d’informations en cause peuvent avoir des répercussions importantes sur la relation patient-médecin. Les rôles et les attentes au sein de cette relation sont affectés à la fois par la dimension institutionnelle de la logistique de traitement des données génomiques et l’évolution des possibilités de retour des informations non sollicitées ou nouvelles. Comme la relation entre médecin et patient change sous l’influence des données génomiques, la question se pose de savoir comment les droits du patient peuvent être sauvegardés dans ce changement du rôle et de la responsabilité du clinicien. Je soutiens que cette question nécessite une remise en question de l’autorité du patient dans le traitement de la circulation de l’information dans le contexte clinique. Plus précisément, je soutiens que l’autorité du patient en médecine personnalisée doit être formée à partir d’un point de vue centré sur le participant. Bien que la possibilité d’une « médecine personnalisée », qui promet des soins plus efficaces et une prévention sur mesure, a été qualifiée de révolutionnaire et a reçu une grande attention des auteurs de diverses origines, les conséquences de cette révolution pour la relation médecin-patient ont surtout été abordées très timidement. Ce document vise à contribuer à la littérature existant sur le sujet en discutant le cadre de cette évolution de la relation et le rôle de l’autorité du patient en son sein. À cette fin, je vais d’abord décrire le WGS comme un outil de diagnostic et son rôle dans l’idée de la médecine personnalisée. Je suggère que les défis du WGS portent sur les rôles et les attentes de la relation médecin-patient. Puis je montre comment ces rôles et ces attentes peuvent être affectés en raison d’un flou entre les lignes du dépistage et du diagnostic ainsi qu’entre la recherche et la pratique clinique. En outre, je décris la possibilité qu’ont les patients de recontacter leur clinicien pour reconsidérer la situation en fonction des données génétiques. Puis j’examine comment ces changements dans la relation entre le patient et le médecin affectent l’autorité de prise de décision du patient. Je conclus que l’émergence de WGS appelle à une réévaluation de l’autorité du patient. Je donne quelques indications sur la façon dont cette réévaluation devrait être constituée, et termine en posant un certain nombre de questions à l’égard de ce thème.}

abstract = {Introduction T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and lymphoma (T-LBL) originate from the common T-cell precursors and are formally differentiated by bone marrow blast count with less than 25% considered as T-LBL. ALL treatment protocols are successfully applied with quite similar long-term results in both entities. Dose intense chemotherapy is proposed to be the best option. RALL is conducting a prospective multicenter trial in the treatment of Ph-negative adult ALL patients based on the opposite approach - non-intensive but non-interruptive treatment (NCT01193933). T-LBL pts were included in the study.So we decided to define whether the difference in response rate and long-term results exists in T-ALL and T-LBL patients treated according to RALL-2009 protocol. Patients and Methods The therapy was unified for all Ph-negative ALL pts, but in T-cell ALL/LBL autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT) after non-myeloablative BEAM conditioning was scheduled as late intensification (+3-4 mo of CR) followed by prolonged 2 years maintenance. From Jan 2009, till Jul 2016, 30 centers enrolled 107 T-ALL/LBL pts. Median age was 28 years (15-54 y), 34 f / 73 m; early T-cell (TI/II) phenotype was verified in 56 (52.3%), mature (T-IV) - in 10 (9.4%), thymic (TIII, CD1a+) ALL - in 41 pts (38.3%). T-lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL= <25% b/m blasts) was diagnosed in 22 pts (20,5%). We divided the analyzed population into 3 groups: < 5% b/m blasts, with 5-24%, ≥25%. Pts’ characteristics according to the b/m involvement are depicted in Table 1. Autologous HSCT was performed in 35, allogeneic-in 7 pts. The analysis was performed in July 2016. Results As it’s shown in Table 1 the patients with T-LBL disregarding the % of blasts cells (<5% or 5-24%) have much less initial WBC and LDH levels, more frequent mediastinum involvement, less frequent CNS disease in comparison with T-ALL patients. There were no patients with pro-T-subtype (T1) T-LBL comparing with 42% of patients with pro-T-ALL. Mature T-subtype was slightly more frequent (4/22 vs 6/85) (p=0,1) in T-LBL. Total CR rate in 97 available for analysis patients was 87,6% (n=85), induction death was registered in 5,1% (n=5), resistance-in 7,2% (n=7). All induction deaths occurred in T-ALL patients, resistant cases were registered much more frequently (p=0,01) in T-LBL with less than 5% of blast cells than in T-ALL (3/10 vs 4/85). Only 35 of 85 (41,2%) CR pts underwent autologous HSCT due to logistics problems and refusals. Auto-HSCT was done at a median time of 6 mo from CR and pts proceeded to further maintenance. We compared 5-y disease-free survival (DFS) and probability of relapse (RP) in transplanted pts and those who survived in CR ≥ 6 months (land-mark) receiving only chemotherapy. This analysis was carried out in 2 cohorts of patients: T-LBL (<5%; 5-24%) and T-ALL (≥25%). Land-mark analysis demonstrated the essential benefit of auto-HSCT only for T-ALL patients: DFS from time of transplantation was 95% and from land-mark for chemotherapy group - 61% (p=0,005), RP-5% vs 30% (p=0,02). But in T-LBL pts there were no benefit of autologous HSCT over chemotherapy (DFS -100% vs 86%, RP-0% vs 14%, p=0,3). At 5 years overall survival (OS) for the whole T-ALL/T-LBL group constituted-66%, DFS-76%. There were no differences in OS (77% vs 66%, p=0,8) and in DFS (87% vs 74%, p=0,7) in T-LBL and T-ALL. Conclusions Our data demonstrate that non-intensive, but non-interruptive treatment approach is effective as in T-ALL so in T-LBL. T-LBL patients had no induction mortality but more frequently were reported as having resistant disease on RALL-2009 protocol. Auto-HSCT after BEAM conditioning followed by maintenance provided substantial benefit only for patients with T-ALL, but not T-LBL.

abstract = {Background
Off-the-shelf devices for branched endovascular aortic repair of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) have been developed to overcome the manufacturing- and logistics-related delays characteristic of device customization. Nonetheless, the structural requirements of branched endovascular aortic repair, together with the need for additional thoracic components to suit different anatomies, might lead to a large sacrifice of healthy aorta.
Methods
We enrolled 18 consecutive TAAA patients treated between 2010 and 2016 in two centers employing the off-the-shelf t-Branch (Cook Medical, Bloomington, Ind) device (TB group). We matched these 18 patients one-to-one with another 18 patients of the 464 consecutive TAAAs treated in the same period by means of open repair (O group) in one of the two centers. The patients were matched on the basis of t-Branch feasibility, distance from the left subclavian artery to the beginning of the aneurysm, and diameter of proximal landing zone evaluated at preoperative computed tomography angiography. We compared the overall length of sacrificed healthy native aorta (the sealing zone in the TB group) in the two groups according to postoperative computed tomography angiography, and we investigated the number of intercostal arteries lost from that healthy aortic segment. We calculated also the real unnecessary sacrificed aorta by subtracting the compulsory minimum neck coverage requested to obtain the proximal sealing (25 mm).
Results
We matched one-to-one six extent II, seven extent III, and five extent IV TAAAs. Overall, the length of sacrificed healthy aorta was longer (P < .001) in the TB group (median length: TB group, 49 mm [interquartile range (IQR), 31-60 mm]; O group, 14 mm [IQR, 10-20 mm]), and consequently the number of intercostal arteries lost (median number of pairs lost: TB group, four [IQR, three-four]; O group, two [IQR, one-three]) was higher (P = .004). Stratifying the results according to TAAA extent and after having subtracted from the TB group the length of aorta required for proximal sealing (25 mm), the length of sacrificed healthy aorta was longer (P = .008) only in the extent IV TAAA, 125 mm (IQR, 56-155 mm). The number of intercostal artery pairs sacrificed was longer only in extent III TAAA (P = .043) and extent IV TAAA (P = .024). No significant 30-day clinical outcomes difference was observed between the matched groups.
Conclusions
The use of the t-Branch device compared with open repair is associated with a greater sacrifice of healthy aorta in extent IV TAAA and with an increased loss of intercostal arteries arising from healthy aortic proximal neck. The theoretical possible increased risk of spinal cord ischemia secondary to the routine use of this off-the-shelf device should thus be analyzed further.}

abstract = {Chemical tracers are proposed as an effective means of detecting, attributing and quantifying any CO2 leaks to surface from geological CO2 storage sites, a key component of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology. A significant proportion of global CO2 storage capacity is located offshore, with some regions of the world having no onshore stores. To assure regulatory bodies and the public of CO2 storage integrity it is important to demonstrate that robust offshore monitoring systems are in place. A range of chemical tracers for leakage have been tested at onshore pilot CCS projects worldwide, but to date they have not been trialled at injection projects or CO2 release experiments located offshore. Here, for the first time, we critically review the current issues surrounding commercial scale use of tracers for offshore CCS projects, and examine the constraints and cost implications posed by the marine environment. These constraints include the logistics of sampling for tracers offshore, the fate of tracers in marine environments, tracer background levels, marine toxicity and legislative barriers – with particular focus on the Europe and the UK. It is clear that chemicals that form a natural component of the CO2 stream are preferable tracers for ease of permitting and avoiding cost and risks of procuring and artificially adding a tracer. However, added tracers offer more reliability in terms of their unique composition and the ability to control and regulate concentrations. We identify helium and xenon isotopes (particularly 124,129Xe), and artificial tracers such as PFCs and deuterated methane as the most suitable added tracers. This is due to their conservative behaviour, low environmental impact and relative inexpense. Importantly, we also find that SF6 and C14 are not viable tracers for CCS due to environmental concerns, and many other potential tracers can be ruled out on the basis of cost. Further, we identify key challenges that are unique to using tracers for offshore monitoring, and highlight critical uncertainties that future work should address. These include possible adsorption or dispersion of tracer compounds during ascent through the overburden, longevity of tracers over the timeframes relevant for CCS monitoring, the permissible environmental effects of tracer leakage, and tracer behaviour in seabed CO2 bubble streams and in dissolved CO2. These uncertainties directly affect the selection of appropriate tracers, the injection program and concentrations necessary for their reliable detection, and appropriate sampling approaches. Hence offshore tracer selection and associated expense are currently poorly constrained. Further, there is limited experience of sampling for tracers in the marine environment; current approaches are expensive and must be streamlined to enable affordable monitoring strategies. Further work is necessary to address these unknowns so as to evaluate the performance of potential tracers for CO2 leak quantitation and provide more accurate costings for effective offshore tracer monitoring programs.}

abstract = {Objective
Patient complaints are a valuable resource for monitoring and improving patient safety and quality of care. The purpose of this study was to analyze the complaint letters received at a Swiss academic emergency department (ED) over six years.
Methods
A retrospective study of all complaint letters sent to a Swiss academic ED between 2009 and 2014 was conducted. The following data were extracted: epidemiology items, reasons for complaints, hospital responses, follow-up, and severity of the events mentioned in the complaints. All complaint letters related to adult patients evaluated in the ED between 2009 and 2014 were included and a qualitative evaluation was performed based on a systematic taxonomy. Context, patient characteristics, mode of resolution and clinical severity of the related adverse event were evaluated.
Results
A total number of 156 complaints were recorded, corresponding to an annual complaint rate of 5.5 to 8.8 per 10,000 visits. The complaints concerned mostly three domains (clinical care, management and patient or caregiver relationship) with a slight predominance for organisation and logistics (39%) compared with 31.4% for standard of care and 29.6% for communication/relational complaints. The majority of complaints were sent within one month of the ED visit. Most complaints were resolved with written apologies or explanations. The consequences of 73.5% of the events in question were considered minor or negligible, 19% moderate, and 6.5% major. Only 1% (two cases) was related to situations with catastrophic consequences.
Conclusion
Complaint incidence in our ED was low and remained stable over the six-year observation period. Most of the complaints pertained to incidents that entailed negligible or minor consequences. As most complaints were due to inadequate communication, interventions targeting improvement of the doctor/patient communication are required.
Résumé
Introduction
La médecine d’urgence, en raison du flux souvent important et peu prévisible de patients se présentant pour des motifs variés, est régulièrement exposée aux critiques. Dans une vision d’amélioration de la qualité, les plaintes des patients constituent une source d’information précieuse pour évaluer et améliorer leurs prises en charge.
Objectif
Analyser les plaintes adressées au service des urgences d’un hôpital tertiaire pour détecter et comprendre les dysfonctionnements d’un système et tenter d’y apporter des solutions.
Méthode
Étude rétrospective monocentrique incluant toutes les lettres de plaintes adressées au Service des urgences du CHU de Lausanne entre 2009 et 2014. Les données concernant l’épidémiologie des patients, les motifs des plaintes et les réponses données ont été analysées pour chaque plainte. La sévérité des événements mentionnés dans les plaintes a été analysée à l’aide d’un outil validé « The National Patient Safety Agency ».
Résultats
Au total, 156 plaintes ont été répertoriées, correspondant à un taux annuel de 5,5 à 8,8 plaintes pour 10 000 consultations. Ces plaintes concernaient essentiellement les aspects organisationnels/logistiques (39 %), les soins (31,4 %) et le relationnel (29,6 %). La majorité (62 %) des plaintes ont été envoyées dans le mois suivant la consultation aux urgences. La plupart (89 %) ont été résolues par un courrier d’excuses ou d’explications. Quant à la sévérité, 73,5 % des événements mentionnés dans les plaintes concernaient des situations jugées négligeables ou mineures, 19 % présentaient des conséquences modérées, 6,5 % des conséquences majeures et seulement 1 % (deux cas) concernaient des situations avec conséquences jugées catastrophiques.
Conclusions
Le taux de plaintes enregistrées était faible et est resté stable sur les six années étudiées. La majorité des plaintes (73,5 %) concernaient des cas avec des conséquences négligeables ou mineures. Nos résultats montrent que des stratégies pour améliorer la communication entre médecins et patients seraient bénéfiques.}

Global efforts are underway to develop practical guidance for implementation of data sharing and open data resources. These include the recent recommendation of ‘FAIR Data Principles’, which assert that if data is to have broad scientific value, then digital representations of that data should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR). The spinal cord injury (SCI) research field has a long history of collaborative initiatives that include sharing of preclinical research models and outcome measures. In addition, new tools and resources are being developed by the SCI research community to enhance opportunities for data sharing and access. With this in mind, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) hosted a workshop on October 5–6, 2016 in Bethesda, MD, in collaboration with the Open Data Commons for Spinal Cord Injury (ODC-SCI) titled “Preclinical SCI Data: Creating a FAIR Share Community”. Workshop invitees were nominated by the workshop steering committee (co-chairs: ARF and VPL; members: AC, KDA, MSB, KF, LBJ, PGP, JMS), to bring together junior and senior level experts including preclinical and basic SCI researchers from academia and industry, data science and bioinformatics experts, investigators with expertise in other neurological disease fields, clinical researchers, members of the SCI community, and program staff representing federal and private funding agencies. The workshop and ODC-SCI efforts were sponsored by the International Spinal Research Trust (ISRT), the Rick Hansen Institute, Wings for Life, the Craig H. Neilsen Foundation and NINDS. The number of attendees was limited to ensure active participation and feedback in small groups. The goals were to examine the current landscape for data sharing in SCI research and provide a path to its future. Below are highlights from the workshop, including perspectives on the value of data sharing in SCI research, workshop participant perspectives and concerns, descriptions of existing resources and actionable directions for further engaging the SCI research community in a model that may be applicable to many other areas of neuroscience. This manuscript is intended to share these initial findings with the broader research community, and to provide talking points for continued feedback from the SCI field, as it continues to move forward in the age of data sharing.}

abstract = {Introduction: Treatment of multiple myeloma (MM) has evolved tremendously, resulting in significant improvement of overall survival in patients. Frontline therapy can be broadly categorized into: proteasome inhibitor (PI)-based, immunomodulatory (IMiD)-based or PI+IMiD-based. Despite their widespread benefit, a considerable proportion of patients achieve suboptimal response to treatment. It would be clinically valuable to understand disease biology prior to initiating therapy and be able to predict the likelihood of response. Prior studies have attempted such a process in which response to PI and/or IMiD-based treatments were retrospectively examined in correlation to genomic testing from pre-treatment patient samples. The MMRF CoMMpass study provides a unique opportunity for interrogation of genes predictive of response to PI and/or IMiD-based regimens. Here, we performed a comparative analysis of genes previously reported to be associated with response to treatment or survival in MM patients with data recorded from the CoMMpass trial. Methods: Previous studies with reported relationship of gene expression and response/survival outcome to PI and/or IMiD-based regimens were identified (Table 1). Next, we interrogated the CoMMpass database and abstracted patients by Best Response to First Line Therapy. Therapy class (PI and/or IMiD-based) was simplified to match the comparator studies in Table 1. We analyzed the genes reported in studies from Table 1 against our PI-based, IMiD-based and PI+IMiD-based CoMMpass patient cohorts. Logistics regression modeling and Bonferroni correction methods were applied adjusting for patient age, gender and ISS stage and gene odds ratios were calculated. An alpha of <0.00029 was considered significant due to multiple comparison of genes between the groups. We also compared mRNA expression for the genes identified in these 3 different treatment cohorts that had an alpha of ≤0.05 between patients classified as Responders (≥PR) and Non-responders (<PR). Results: Of the 7 previous studies identified, 4 were PI-based, 1 was IMiD-based and 2 were PI+IMiD-based. From among these studies, a total of 173 genes (132 genes in the PI-based group; 25 in the IMiD-based group and 17 in the PI+IMiD-based group) were cross-analyzed in patients from the CoMMpass study. In the PI-based cohort, 10 genes with an alpha of ≤0.05 were associated with an increased likelihood of not responding to treatment, with OR ranging from 1.32-E5 (CNGA1) - 0.99 (CCND1). In the IMiDs-based treatment cohort, we identified 2 genes associated with an increased likelihood of response, with OR of 1.2 (RPL26L1 and SNRPD1) and an alpha of 0.02 and 0.03, respectively. In the PI+IMiD-based group, 22 genes (p≤0.05) with OR ranging from 2.28 (HIST1H3B) - 0.85 (WIPF2) were associated with the likelihood of response. Relative gene expression analysis in the different treatment CoMMpass cohorts showed that in PI-based treatment patients NMT1, PSMD4, MAP4K4, CNGA1, DR1 and UBFD1 were significantly decreased in responders (n=228) vs. non-responders (n=14) (p<0.05-<0.001). In the IMiD-based cohort, C14orf2 and RPL26L1 were significantly increased in responders (n=32) vs. non-responders (n=7, p<0.05). In the PI+IMiD treatment group, ACVC1C, CRYGS, FUNDC1, PSMB3, RPL26L1, HIST1H3B, PSMB10 and STUB1 were significantly increased whereas TMC8, MAPK4, CCNB1IP1, SAP18, ANK3, JAK1, RUNX3, IKZF1, CUL4B, HNRNPC and WIPF2 were significantly decreased in responders (n=361) vs. non-responders (n=18) (p<0.05-<0.001). Conclusion: Our analysis investigates utility of the CoMMpass database to interrogate molecular data previously reported and shown to be associated with outcome to therapy in MM patients. While useful in comparison of relative gene expression changes and mutation data associated with patients receiving PI, IMiD or PI+IMiD-based therapy, cross-comparison of data from prior studies should be performed with caution considering variability in methodology and patients who have received treatment at different stages of their disease vs. frontline only in the CoMMpass dataset. Overall our analysis highlights the potential of CoMMpass data to develop future prospective studies with biomarkers and/or predictive models for MM therapeutics.

abstract = {Prestigious brands of cookies usually use metallic tins as packaging to distribute and sell their products, trying to impress the customer through the appearance of the packaging and simultaneously avoiding smashing or damaging of the cookies during logistics operations. These packages are commonly made in a tin coated (2.8g/m2) thin steel sheet (ARCELOR electrolytic Tin plate), which causes severe wear problems on both die and punch tool components during the stamping process at room temperature. The border of the package presents an inconsiderable deformation, despite its almost perpendicular orientation to the top surface, but this top is usually patterned, which also implies the flow of the sheet between the top and bottom die surfaces. Due to the softness of the Tin coating, it easily adheres to the die, generating premature wear and several other concerns in maintaining the required final shape of the tin lid. Lubrication would be an easy way to solve the problems referred above however, lubricated operations should be avoided as these kinds of packages are for food purposes. This study started by identifying the main wear mechanism developed in the main surfaces of the stamping tool, promoted by the Tin coated steel sheet used in the packages. Two advanced PVD coatings (B4C and Mo) were tested, leading to the improvement of the punch and die wear behavior under these working conditions. The transfer of Tin material from the metallic sheet to the punch and die was studied, as well as the friction coefficient of this sheet against some selected coatings, while also trying to minimize the Tin adherence to the surface of the tool. Tribological tests under medium loads were carried out in order to ascertain what kind of coating presents better wear behavior in the referred work conditions. Regarding the obtained results, some improvements will be applied to the coating structure to adjust the deposition parameters in order to go forward to industrial tests. Worn surfaces were studied by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and material transfer was analyzed by Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS). Results obtained with some of the tested coatings confirm that it is possible to minimize the Tin transfer from the covered steel sheet to the die and punch, ensuring a longer life of these parts, decreasing the tool maintenance operations and improving the Overall Equipment Efficiency (OEE) of that stamping process.}

Problématique et objectifs
« Comment réaliser une évaluation fiable de l’exposition journalière aux vibrations corps entier A(8) sans mesure métrologique ? ». L’Association interprofessionnelle des centres médicaux sociaux de santé au travail de la région Île-de-France (ACMS) a vu augmenter pour ce risque les demandes de ces adhérents. Les objectifs de cette étude sont les suivants : optimiser les ressources du service et des adhérents en minimisant les mesurages ; établir une méthodologie pour évaluer ce risque ; accompagner les entreprises dans leur démarche de prévention.
Méthodes
Au total, 116 mesures, issues des études ACMS de terrain, réalisées en logistique de 2009 à 2014 avec des chariots frontaux et des transpalettes, ont été analysées en 2015. Leurs éléments observés ont servi de paramètres dans trois différents outils réputés : estimation INRS, whole body vibration calculator (WBV-HSE), OSEV. Les valeurs A(8) des caristes provenant des études de terrain sont confrontées à celles issues des trois outils, avec en référence les seuils réglementaires (0,5 et 1,15m/s2), illustrées graphiquement par « box plot ». L’interprétation probabiliste pour comparer les résultats des outils et des études ACMS terrain est fondée sur la valeur prédictive (sensibilité et spécificité) et l’étude de la concordance entre deux méthodes par approche graphique « Bland-Altman plots ».
Résultats
Les trois outils étudiés ont tendance à surestimer l’exposition journalière A(8) par rapport aux études ACMS de terrain pour les deux types d’engins. Ils distinguent clairement les travailleurs peu exposés (sensibilité 100 %), mais ne permettent pas de juger de manière sûre du dépassement de la valeur d’action (spécificités faibles).
Conclusion
Les trois outils d’estimation peuvent être utilisés comme première approche du risque vibratoire. Ils permettent cependant de juger du dépassement de la valeur limite d’exposition (spécificité forte). Des progrès sont attendus dans les outils d’estimation pour mieux prendre en compte la réalité de l’activité logistique (biais élevés).
Summary
Purpose of the study
“How to carry out a reliable assessment of the daily exposure whole body vibrations A (8) without measurements?”. The interprofessional Association of the Social Medical centers of occupational health in Île-de-France region (ACMS) observes an increasing amount of requests from their members. The objectives of this study are the following: to optimize the resources of the association and their members by minimizing measurings; to establish a methodology to evaluate vibrations risks; to accompany the employers in their prevention and risk control.
Methods
The results of 116 ACMS vibrations measurements, carried out in logistics from 2009 to 2014 with forklift trucks and pallet trucks with on-board standing drivers, were analyzed in 2015. Their observed elements were used as parameters in three famous tools: estimate INRS, whole body vibration calculator (WBV-HSE), OSEV. Values A (8) of the drivers coming from the measurement campaign are confronted with those from the three tools, in reference to the lawful thresholds (0.5 and 1.15m/s2), illustrated graphically by “box plot”. To compare the results from the tools and measurement campaign, the probabilistic interpretation is founded on the predictive values (sensibility and specificity) and the study of the agreement between two methods by graphic approach “Bland-Altman plots”.
Results
The three studied tools tend to over-estimate the daily exposure A (8) compared to measurement studies for the two types of machines. They clearly differentiate « the low exposed workers » (sensitivity 100%), but do not allow a judgment in a sure way the overtaking of the action value (low specificities).
Conclusion
The three tools for assess can be used during first approach of the vibratory risk. They, however, make it possible to judge going beyond the exposure limit value (strong specificity). Finally, the improving of the tools is expected to better reflect the real logistic activity (high biases).}

abstract = {Introduction: Despite a plethora of novel therapies, autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) continues to offer a progression free survival benefit to multiple myeloma patients. At our institution, standard of care for transplant-eligible patients remains induction with cyclophosphamide, bortezomib, and decadron (CyBorD) for 4 cycles, followed by ASCT. However, limited resources for collection and the logistics of receiving late referrals from outside centers often result in patients receiving additional cycles of treatment prior to transplant. We sought to determine whether the administration of additional induction chemo led to increased peri-transplant morbidity. Methods: With REB approval, chart review was done for myeloma patients receiving an ASCT between 2007 and 2017. Only patients receiving induction with CyBorD or bortezomib-decadron on a like schedule were included in analysis. Patients received pre-ASCT conditioning of high-dose melphalan (93.5%) or busulfan-melphalan (6.5%). Data collected included patient's age, gender, myeloma subtype, ISS score, and cytogenetics, as well as the number of induction cycles received and hematopoietic cell transplantation-specific co-morbidity index (HCT-CI). The primary endpoint assessed was median length of hospital stay (LOS) post-infusion. Secondary end-points included time to engraftment, ICU transfer rate, infection rate, organ-specific toxicity, 100-day mortality, and response as measured by VGPR rate at 100 days. Patients were grouped into those who received 2-4 cycles vs. 5-9 cycles of induction. Results: Fifty-three patients received 2-4 cycles of induction and 54 received 5-9. Median age was 61 for both groups, gender was well-matched (53% vs. 57% male), and HCT-CI ≥ 3 was similar (26% vs. 31%).The only significant difference between groups was the subtype of myeloma, with the 2-4 group having 30.1% light chain disease (vs. 14.8%) and 39.6% IgG subtype (vs. 61.1%) (p = 0.026). Median LOS post-infusion was 20 days in the 2-4 group and 17 days in the 5-9 group. Median time to engraftment was 12 days in both (range 9-21 in 2-4 group, 10-20 in 5-9 group). ICU transfer was needed in 4 (7.5%) and 6 (11.1%) patients in the respective groups, and there were two deaths in the 5-9 group (one of sepsis at d+16 and one of multi-organ failure at d+46). Both patients had HCT-CI scores of 5, and the differences in ICU and mortality rates were not statistically significant. There were no significant differences in measurable toxicity. Documented infection or febrile neutropenia occurred in 92.5% vs. 88.9% (p = 0.53); acute kidney injury in 20.8% vs. 11.1% (p= 0.17); and acute liver injury in 24.5% vs. 14.8% (p = 0.21). Among evaluable patients, 84.6% achieved VGPR or better in the 2-4 group and 78.4% in the 5-9 group, although the latter had a higher number of patients with high-risk cytogenetics by FISH (6 vs. 10 with t(4;14) or 17p-). Discussion: Evidence for a precise number of cycles of induction prior to ASCT is scarce. A recent study by Charaborty et. al.(BJHJul 2018) showed that median PFS and OS were similar between patients who received ≤ 4 months vs. > 4 months of induction. 39% of their patients received bortezomib-based induction without lenalidomide, akin to our regimen. Likewise, our study showed no significant difference in VGPR rates at 100 days, an endpoint used at our center as one criterion for determining the need for tandem transplant and potential increased chemotherapy exposure for the patient. Our overall VGPR rate for the group of 81.6% is comparable to previously published results, suggesting our population is representative of a typical myeloma cohort. Most importantly, our data suggests no increase in peri-transplant toxicity as a result of the additional induction chemotherapy burden. In fact, there was a surprising trend towards decreased organ toxicity and shorter hospital stay, and the only two early deaths occurred in high-risk patients. Among the 17 patients who received the heaviest induction burden (7-9 cycles), there were no deaths and only 1 ICU transfer. While there did not appear to be any long-term benefit to greater induction length, our study provides reassurance that it is safe to continue CyBorD induction past the intended 4 cycles without compromising patient safety at the time of transplant.

abstract = {Background. Gene mutation profiling is increasingly employed for diagnosis, risk stratification, and clinical management in patients with MDS. However, current World Health Organization MDS classification is still based on histologic findings (with the exception of SF3B1 for MDS-RS), and guidelines generally suggest that clinical decisions be guided by clinico-pathologic risk stratification tools such as Revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R). We sought to study beliefs and patterns of practice with respect to gene mutation profiling among health care providers who manage patients with MDS. Methods. A link to a 23-question web-based survey was emailed to members of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)-ACRIN Cancer Research Group, Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology (Alliance), and the Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG), and the Cancer Trials Support Unit (CTSU) on 5/1/2018 with 6 subsequent weekly reminders. The Qualtrics survey platform was used to record anonymous responses. We used descriptive statistics to analyze the data. No incentive was provided for responses. Results. Of 371 received responses, 262 were received from providers who did not manage MDS patients or lacked analyzable data and therefore were excluded. Of 109 eligible responses, 108 responders were from institutions representing 31 US states (one respondent was from South America). Median age of respondents was 48 years (range, 33-75); 43 (39%) were women. A third of responders (32%) worked at a university hospital, while 25%, 17%, and 5% worked at a community hospital, private practice, or other settings, respectively. While 37% of participants worked at institutions with guidelines for clinical care of MDS patients, 28% reported that their institutional guidelines recommended MDS-specific gene mutation profiling. Such testing was performed at institutions of 13% participants; institutions of 26% of responders tested a general AML panel that included MDS-specific genes. The total number of respondents whose institutions sent out either an MDS-specific gene panel or a general AML gene panel with MDS-specific genes was similar, 25% and 12%, respectively (Fig. 1). Of those who routinely perform molecular testing, 94% do so at diagnosis, 56% at relapse, 33% during preparation for stem cell transplant, 31% after the failure of hypomethylating agents (HMA), 24% during screening for a clinical trial, and 15% at initial treatment (Fig. 2). MDS gene mutation profiling was felt to be most helpful in diagnosis (rarely 11%; sometimes 49%; often 30%; always 9%), risk stratification (sometimes 31%; often 51%; always 15%), and prognosis (sometimes 31%; often 51%; always 14%); its role was more limited in response assessment (never 12%; rarely 25%; sometimes 44%; often 14%) and to predict responses to HMAs (never 5%; rarely 28%; sometimes 52%, often 14%) (Fig. 3). Various types of evidence were used to stratify MDS risk and prognosis: genetic mutations were used by nearly everyone (95%); 70% relied on morphologic findings, while gene expression/transcriptome profiling was used by 40%. Eighty-four percent of responders reported relying on conventional prognostic models like IPSS-R to identify high-risk patients for whom they would consider intensive treatment options. For this purpose, 62% would also rely on mutation profiling, and 32% would also consider higher frequency of gene mutations. While mutations in the p53 pathway were felt to be helpful in terms of risk stratification and treatment decisions by 70% of responders, 43%, 39%, 31%, 26% 23%, 20%, and 3% considered mutations in spliceosome, DNA methylation, transcription factors, histone modification, signaling, RAS pathway, and cohesin genes, respectively, to be useful as well. Approximately 31% of responders were not certain as to which mutations would affect risk stratification and management choices and said they needed to review literature. The respondents also cited multiple limitations to wider clinical use of MDS gene mutation profiling (Fig. 4). Conclusions. Our survey demonstrates widespread use of gene mutation profiling in the management of patients with MDS, but also reveals substantial variability in beliefs, practices, testing logistics, and interpretation of molecular profiling. Our findings emphasize the need for high-quality data to develop consensus evidence-based guidelines for gene profiling of MDS patients.

abstract = {The present study assessed the potential for biochemical conversion of energy stored in agricultural waste and residue in Iran. The current status of agricultural residue as a source of bioenergy globally and in Iran was investigated. The total number of publications in this field from 2000 to 2014 was about 4294. Iran ranked 21st with approximately 54 published studies. A total of 87 projects have been devised globally to produce second-generation biofuel through biochemical pathways. There are currently no second-generation biorefineries in Iran and agricultural residue has no significant application. The present study determined the amount and types of sustainable agricultural residue and oil-rich crops and their provincial distribution. Wheat, barley, rice, corn, potatoes, alfalfa, sugarcane, sugar beets, apples, grapes, dates, cotton, soybeans, rapeseed, sesame seeds, olives, sunflowers, safflowers, almonds, walnuts and hazelnuts have the greatest potential as agronomic and horticultural crops to produce bioenergy in Iran. A total of 11.33million tonnes (Mt) of agricultural biomass could be collected for production of bioethanol (3.84gigaliters (Gl)), biobutanol (1.07Gl), biogas (3.15billion cubic meters (BCM)), and biohydrogen (0.90BCM). Additionally, about 0.35Gl of biodiesel could be obtained using only 35% of total Iranian oilseed. The potential production capacity of conventional biofuel blends in Iran, environmental and socio-economic impacts including well-to-wheel greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and the social cost of carbon dioxide reduction are discussed. The cost of emissions could decrease up to 55.83% by utilizing E85 instead of gasoline. The possible application of gaseous biofuel in Iran to produce valuable chemicals and provide required energy for crop cultivation is also studied. The energy recovered from biogas produced by wheat residue could provide energy input for 115.62 and 393.12 thousand hectares of irrigated and rain-fed wheat cultivation in Iran, respectively. The nitrogen requirement for 33.6% of the total wheat cultivation area could be supplied by the ammonia acquired from biohydrogen. A discussion of the logistics of collection and transportation of the biomass and sensitivity analysis are carried out to evaluate the effect of field cover factor, crop yield, and well-to-wheel GHG emission on collectable residue, biofuel production, and GHG emissions.}
