abstract = {We present a novel humanitarian supply chain approach to address disaster preparedness and build response capacity in humanitarian supply chains when people’s vulnerability matters. Our primary motivation comes from the fact that disasters in Brazil are often associated with unequal distribution of opportunities and social inequalities that end up pushing more vulnerable people to risky areas or informal settlements. Moreover, investment in disaster management has dropped over the past few years in Brazil. In this way, we wonder: how to use the somewhat limited financial budget as effectively as possible towards meeting those that need the most while addressing disaster preparedness activities? To answer this question, we develop an optimization model to address location, capacity planning, prepositioning, local procurement, and relief aid flows’ decisions. Differently from most existing research, we adopt the so-called Social Vulnerability Index (SoVI) in the objective function to build enhanced response capacity in more vulnerable areas when the lack of resources makes impassable to fulfil all victims’ needs at once. Through a rich and real case-study based on the Brazilian Humanitarian Supply Chain, we come up with critical insights that can help to improve the humanitarian supply chain practices in the country. In particular, we show that the social benefit of using SoVI is as more significant as the vulnerability increases, which reveals the importance of considering this index to design more social-effective humanitarian supply chains.}

abstract = {Kitting is a materials supply principle that plays a vital role for performance in mixed model assembly systems. The kit preparation process, whereby component kits are created, is central when kitting is applied. Kit preparation is a form of materials handling and is associated with several ergonomic and quality related issues. Robotics holds a great potential for decreasing the need for human labour, but literature on the topic is scarce. The purpose of this paper is to identify the time efficiency potential of a dual robot application for kit preparation. To address the purpose, a mathematical model is developed that allows dual robot kit preparation to be analysed and compared with manual kit preparation. Furthermore, the model supports identification of a suitable batch size given a lead time requirement from the assembly system. A numerical example shows dual robot kit preparation to be slightly more efficient than its manual ditto for preparation of 2, 3 and 4 kit batch sizes. The paper makes a theoretical contribution in terms of the time efficiency model of dual robot kit preparation. This model is also useful for practitioners when evaluating the potential of dual robot arm kit preparation in their own processes.}

abstract = {Natural disasters impact transportation networks adversely and cause road sections to be damaged or blocked. The road network may even become disconnected, impeding accessibility between disaster-stricken areas and critical locations such as hospitals, relief aid depots and transportation hubs. In the immediate response phase, a set of blocked edges should be selected and restored to reconnect the transportation network. While locations of the disrupted roads can be identified using drone or satellite images, an accurate estimation of time to restore a road segment can be carried out only after expert observations on the field. In this article, we study a post-disaster road restoration problem modeled on an undirected edge-weighted graph with k blocked edges, where the unblocking time of a blocked edge is revealed online once the road restoration team visits an end-node of that blocked edge. The objective is to minimize the time at which the road network is reconnected. We first investigate the worst-case performance of online algorithms against offline optimal solutions by means of the competitive ratio. We prove that any online deterministic algorithm cannot achieve a competitive ratio better than 2k−1. We also provide an optimal online algorithm that is proven to achieve this lower bound. In addition, to achieve good performance on realistic instances, we implement an algorithm that solves a mixed integer programming model each time new information is revealed. Since model solution is prohibitively time-consuming, we also propose a novel polynomial time online algorithm. We compare these two algorithms with two other benchmark online algorithms on both Istanbul road network instances and several other city instances from the literature. Our experiments show that the proposed polynomial time online algorithm performs superior to the benchmark ones and obtains solutions close to the offline optimum on all the tested instances.}

As a case study, we consider the ICU ward of a major Italian public hospital and we focus on antibiotics. We exploit a previously developed Mixed Integer Linear Programming model which decides, for each drug, when and how much to order, and we improve it by adding different sets of constraints to represent each stakeholders’ point of view. By solving three generalized models, each of which ties the satisfaction of a single stakeholder to different thresholds, we explore the mutual effects of taking explicitly into account different perspectives within the inventory policy. We implemented an instance generator, built on the basis of empirical probability distributions extracted from a large set of observed historical data and representing the decision flow ruling drugs prescription. Extensive experiments have been carried out on a set of realistic instances provided by the generator. Results based on our test case not only provide computational evidence to intuitive relations among stakeholders, but also suggest possible levels of compromise. Improved stakeholder satisfaction would also benefit the patient, the passive stakeholder who is the ultimate subject of the caring process.}

abstract = {Introduction
Laser Doppler imaging (LDI) is still not an ubiquitous part of burn care worldwide despite reported accuracy rates of more than 95%, which is significantly higher than clinical assessment alone (50–75%). The aims of Part I of this survey study are: to identify the most important barriers for the use of LDI and to provide useful recommendations for efficient implementation in routine burn care. The actual interpretation and use of LDI measurements is discussed in the Enigma Part II article.
Material and methods
1. Informative interviews with 15 representatives of burn centers without LDI. 2. A survey among 51 burn centers with LDI by means of an extensive questionnaire. 3. In-depth interviews with 21 of the participating centers.
Results
1. All 15 centers without LDI indicated that cost of purchase in combination with maintenance of the LDI device, as well as personnel costs were the reason for not buying, while 12 (80%) also rated the current scientific evidence as insufficient. 2. Twenty-seven burn centers with an LDI (53%) participated and filled in almost the entire questionnaire. In 5 centers, cost delayed the purchase of LDI. The hospital/department paid for the LDI device in 62% of the burn centers and in 88% also for maintenance and salaries. The LDI operators were mainly surgeons (47%) or nurses (42%). In more than half of the burn centers (52%), between 2 and 5 people were trained and certified to use an LDI. In 50% of burn centers, the interpretation of the LDI scan was done by the same person doing the actual measurements. Eighty-nine percent of the burn centers considered the accuracy of the LDI scan as mainly to almost completely accurate. In case of real discrepancy between clinical diagnosis and LDI, in 48% of the burn centers (13/27) the surgeon still relied more on the clinical diagnosis despite reporting this high or almost complete accuracy rate of the LDI.
Conclusions
Barriers for the routine implementation of LDI were: 1. cost of purchasing and using an LDI combined with health care systems that inadequately reimburse non-surgical management; 2. lack of awareness of or ongoing skepticism towards the scientific evidence supporting LDI use; and 3. organizational constraints combined with logistical limitations. Our recommendations for wider use of LDI technology include: 1. a cost-effective reimbursement of LDI use combined with a more appropriate valuation of expert conservative management compared to surgical therapy; 2. increased use of LDI for every mixed depth burn and; 3. specialized LDI teams to improve burn procedural flexibility and to enable embedding LDI use in the burn care routine. Implementing these measures would promote the highest standards for LDI measurements and interpretation resulting in optimal care with mutual benefits for the hospital, for burn care teams and, most importantly, for the patients.}

abstract = {The performance of shipping companies greatly depends on reduced berthing times. The trend towards bigger ships and shorter berthing times places severe stress on container terminals, which cannot simply increase the available cranes indefinitely. Therefore, the focus is on optimizing existing resources. An effective way of speeding up the loading/unloading operations of ships at the container terminal is to use the idle time before the arrival of a ship for sorting the stored containers in advance. The pre-marshalling problem consists in rearranging the containers placed in a bay in the order in which they will be required later, looking for a sequence with the minimum number of moves. With sorted bays, loading/unloading operations are significantly faster, as there is no longer a need to make unproductive moves in the bays once ships are berthed. In this paper, we address the pre-marshalling problem by developing and testing integer linear programming models. Two alternative families of models are proposed, as well as an iterative solution procedure that does not depend on a difficult to obtain upper bound. An extensive computational analysis has been carried out over several well-known datasets from the literature. This analysis has allowed us to test the performance of the models, and to conclude that the performance of the best proposed model is superior to that of previously published alternatives.}

Entering it at a higher level entails lower sorting costs for the retailer, but higher delivery costs, and longer delivery times. The customer orders arrive at various moments over a rolling planning horizon. This means that the retailer must also make consolidation decisions. We model and solve the static and dynamic cases of this problem. The static case is modeled as an integer linear program and solved by CPLEX. We develop and compare four shipping policies for the dynamic case. Extensive computational results based on real location data from California and Texas are reported.}

Bloodstream infection (BSI) is a major public health burden worldwide, with high mortality. Patient outcome is critically influenced by delayed therapy, and fast and accurate pathogen diagnostics decisively improves the care of patients. During the past two decades major improvements have been made in the diagnostic performance of blood culture diagnostics through actions on pre-analysis and time to result.
Aims
To review and discuss the literature for standard procedures and the progress in BSI pathogen diagnostics, and to propose a new mindset to reach an improved diagnostic workflow.
Sources
Scientific articles and reviews available through NCBI/Pubmed.
Content
Blood culture performance relies largely on the quality of its pre-analytical phase that is improved with educational actions monitored by using key performance indicators, and external quality assessment. Advanced blood culture systems now provide tools for an automated estimation of bottle filling. These proved efficient to facilitate effective training for improving blood collection. On analytic aspects, rapid methods for pathogen identification, among which matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry dominates, and rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing are reviewed. These technical developments call for improvements in all other steps, especially in pre- and post-analytic logistics to give the full reciprocation of these techniques on patient management. This aspect is summarized by the term ‘microbiologistics’, which covers all possible improvements in the logistic chain from sampling to report.
Implications
Progress in BSI pathogen diagnostics is based on a bundle approach that includes optimization of the pre-analytical parameters, rapid start of incubation, the use of rapid methods, re-organization (e.g. 24/7, transportation service) and a close involvement of antimicrobial stewardship teams. These developments lead to define a new standard for bloodstream infection diagnostics.}

This paper develops strategic decision-making models for two different CLSCs with multiple products over multiple periods. One of the networks has six levels, while the other has four levels, and they can be applied to products with different levels of complexity during inspection and remanufacturing operations. The supply chain networks are modeled as Integer Linear Programs (ILP) designed to assist decision-making in terms of location/allocation, transportation, and inventory. Taking advantage of the properties of the formulations, we propose an integer relaxation approach to obtain the optimal solution to ILP. The proposed models and methodologies are illustrated with case studies from the literature and with hypothetical datasets. This research contributes with design standard configurations for CLSCs that can be used for different types of products. Directly using these configurations is advantageous because the models proposed can be quickly solved using the integer relaxation approach. The associated trials confirm the utility of the models for the case studies and demonstrate encouraging results for the hypothetical datasets.}

Simplified formulas for special cases (zero lead time, zero tolerable wait and continuous delivery) are derived and characterized. The window fill rate in the multiple location model is either the minimum of the individual locations’ window fill rates or the weighted average of these window fill rates. The former definition ensures equitability, whereas the latter promotes overall efficiency. Our analysis demonstrates that when resources are scarce, the policies underlying these definitions result in dramatically different allocations and performances.}

abstract = {Reliance on the sharing economy is becoming crucial to the functioning of modern cities. Certain sharing economy-based solutions can contribute to the development of sustainable urban freight transport by reducing the number of delivery vans in service and using green vehicles. This paper evaluates the potential of the sharing economy for freight deliveries in the Polish cities. The authors examine two types of sharing platform-based solutions for light commercial vehicles (LCV), namely LCV-sharing and crowdshipping, along with the general perception of sharing platforms by the Polish citizens and their motivation to use them. Two research methods have been employed. The multi-case study method has been applied to assess the LCV-sharing market and identify the best crowdshipping practices. General interest of the public in the sharing economy has been examined by means of a survey analysis. The results show that, albeit with little market presence, the LCV-sharing is continuously winning new customers in the major Polish cities. Provided by car-sharing operators who have expanded their offering with delivery vans, or by operators who target the freight market alone, the service is a more environmentally-friendly and economical alternative to leasing, especially for companies which do not need extensive use of delivery vans. Further development of LCV-sharing depends largely on availability of the service and its price, as well as on the general awareness of benefits from the sharing business model and the strengthening of confidence in it.}

abstract = {This paper presents a new mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation for the short-term scheduling of liquid transportation by pipeline. It relies on a continuous-time representation featuring a single grid and is suitable for treelike systems with one input node simultaneously feeding multiple output nodes. The novelty is the incorporation of constraints for rigorously enforcing forbidden product sequences and ensuring a single batch inside idle segments. We tackle a real-life problem from the Iranian pipeline network, generating an optimal schedule that increases pipeline capacity by 6.2%, meeting demand from the weekly plan, fourteen hours earlier. We also solve three benchmark problems from the literature. The results show a significantly better performance than a closely related, state-of-the-art, product-centric formulation, which is unable to find a feasible solution for a problem that can now be solved to proven global optimality. It is primarily because multiple batches can enter/leave segments during a time slot.}

abstract = {A Robotic Mobile Fulfillment System (RMFS) is an automated parts-to-picker material handling system, in which robots carry pods with products to the order pickers. It is particularly suitable for e-commerce order fulfillment and can quickly and frequently reallocate workers and robots across the picking and replenishment processes to respond to strong demand fluctuations. More resources for the picking process means lower customer wait times, whereas more resources for the replenishment process means a higher inventory level and product availability. This paper models the RMFS as a queuing network and integrates it within a Markov decision process (MDP), that aims to allocate robots across the pick and replenishment processes during both high and low demand periods, based on the workloads in these processes. We extend existing MDP models with one resource type and one process to an MDP model for two resources types and two processes. The policies derived from the model are compared with benchmark policies from practice. The results show that the length of the peak demand phase and the height of the peak affects the optimal policy choice. In addition, policies that continually reallocate resources based on the workload outperform benchmark policies from practice. Moreover, if the number of robots is limited, continual resource reallocation can reduce costs sharply. The results show that optimal dynamic policies can reduce the cost by up to 52.18% on average compared to optimal fixed policies.}

abstract = {Nowadays the phenomenon of flight delays and cancellations is becoming more and more serious. Flight delays and cancellations not only waste transportation resources, but also affect passengers’ travel plans, which cause an increase in passenger discontent and complaint rates[2]. The passengers’ dissatisfaction and distrust of airlines seriously damage the airlines’ corporate reputation and then affect passengers’ loyalty. Therefore, based on the information of 5 million flight data in the United States in 2016, we predicted the flight cancellations based on four classification algorithms: logistics regression, support vector machine (SVM), naive bayes and decision tree. We compared the training time of these algorithms by changing the number of nodes in the Spark cluster[9], and we also compared the classification accuracy, AUC (Area Under Curve) and PR(Precision-Recall). Experimental results show that: (1) When the number of nodes was 1, the average training time of these algorithms was 460 seconds. When the number of nodes was 3,5,7,9, the corresponding average training time were 207.25 seconds, 89.75 seconds, 44 seconds, 42 seconds, and when the number of nodes was 11, the average training time was 43.5 seconds; (2) Starting from 7 nodes, as the number of nodes increased while the decline rate of the average training time slowed down; (3) When the number of nodes was 1 and 3, the training time of naive bayes was the shortest, which were 386 seconds and 185 seconds respectively. When the number of nodes was 5,7,9 and11, the training time of SVM was the shortest, which were 72 seconds, 21seconds, 19 seconds and 18 seconds respectively; (4) the classification accuracy of SVM and decision tree was almost 90%, but naive bayes was just about 50.8% and logistics regression was only about 62.4%; (5) Both the AUC and PR of the decision tree algorithm were the highest: AUC was 0.558 and PR was 0.439. Therefore, the decision tree algorithm was the most suitable for predicting whether the flight would be cancelled or not, and there was a 90% probability that the prediction would be successful.}

Automated parcel lockers are a way to improve delivery efficiency, but despite their rapid growth, little is known about their accessibility and equity impacts. Among e-commerce players in the U.S., Amazon stands out by its large market share. This research studies the location of Amazon lockers in Portland, Oregon utilizing highway, land use, employment, and sociodemographic datasets. Geographical tools and cluster analysis are utilized to estimate accessibility and equity metrics. Lockers tend to be located in mixed-use areas and can be utilized by a large percentage of the population. However, the equity metrics indicate that the current distribution of lockers could be improved to reach traditionally underserved populations. Given the environmental and economic advantages of lockers, policymakers should encourage the expansion of this type of last mile solution to avoid market failures in areas that are currently underserved.}

abstract = {In a vendor-managed inventory setting, a supplier determines the timing and size of replenishments for its customers. In the Dynamic-Demand Joint Replenishment Problem (DJRP), one assumes that the supplier pays a fixed fee for replenishing a customer which often occurs if the supplier outsources transportation. Hence, there is no incentive for the supplier to schedule replenishments for nearby customers in the same period. This results in higher transportation costs for the carrier, decreased vehicle utilization and increased future fees for the supplier. To lower costs for both parties, this paper extends the traditional DJRP to the DJRP with Approximated Transportation Costs (DJRP-AT) by taking transportation considerations into account. Since routing problems are difficult to solve and it is not necessary to know the sequence of the deliveries to the customers as these are outsourced, the transportation costs for a given set of customers are approximated using classical schemes. A solution approach for the DJRP-AT based on Branch-and-Cut-and-Price is validated using test instances from the literature. Results show improvements of 4% on average and up to 14.4% for individual instances compared with the DJRP. Moreover, when the DJRP-AT is compared with the DJRP on instances derived from a real-life case, similar savings are obtained. Comparing the DJRP-AT to an equivalent problem with actual routing costs, the solution values of the DJRP-AT are on average only 0.77% higher showing the value of the approximation.}

abstract = {Compared with conventional freight vehicles, electric freight vehicles create less local pollution and are thus generally perceived as a more sustainable means of goods distribution. In urban areas, such vehicles must often perform the entirety of their delivery routes without recharging. However, their energy consumption is subject to a fair amount of uncertainty, which is due to exogenous factors such as the weather and road conditions, endogenous factors such as driver behaviour, and several energy consumption parameters that are difficult to measure precisely. Hence we propose a robust optimization framework to take into account these energy consumption uncertainties in the context of an electric vehicle routing problem. The objective is to determine minimum cost delivery routes capable of providing strong guarantees that a given vehicle will not run out of charge during its route. We formulate the problem as a robust mixed integer linear program and solve small instances to optimality using robust optimization techniques. Furthermore, we develop a two-phase heuristic method based on large neighbourhood search to solve larger instances of the problem, and we conduct several numerical tests to assess the quality of the methodology. The computational experiments illustrate the trade-off between cost and risk, and demonstrate the influence of several parameters on best found solutions. Furthermore, our heuristic identifies 42 new best solutions when tested on instances of the closely related robust capacitated vehicle routing problem.}

We are interested in different scenarios with a non-profit approach where given an initial budget, our goal is to design a recycling network where the economic benefits from selling products for reuse or recycle are used to increase the network capacity so we maximize the amount of collected end-of-life products. We implement classic operations research techniques to represent the decision-making process with a maximal covering facility location problem that determines the following decisions: the number and location of capacitated collection centers with a limited-service area; the flow of end-of-life products from demand centers to collection centers and then, to capacitated recycling plants; and the amount of collected products sold to the secondary market. We design a mixed-integer linear formulation for our optimization problem, which can be solved with commercial solvers in short computational times for most of the large instances considered in our experimental stage. Numerical results on a case study in Brazil show that our optimization approach is a handy tool to design a recycling network and identify recycling plants with high low-usage rates.}

Guaranteeing reliable delivery times is, according to different international studies, a strategic competitive advantage. Nonetheless, emerging countries such as Mexico, do not currently count with specific indicators to measure travel time reliability from a freight fluidity approach. As such, there is no clear measurement of the impact and propagation of the variability of transit times throughout the supply chains. Since road transportation is the main mean of transportation in emerging countries, the aim of this paper is to present the analysis carried out to measure the travel time reliability thanks to different methodologies based on freight data collection using GPS (Global Positioning System), as a key element to assess freight fluidity in freight transportation corridors. The analysis measured items such as: (i) percentiles of travel time; (ii) planning time index; (iii) buffer time index; (iv) skew and range of travel. Different probability distributions were analysed and the distribution of travel time data was determined through statistical hypothesis test. The conclusion was that distributions with upper tails longer than usual fit better to the collected data. Evidences of mixture distributions in the travel time data were also found. Finally, the paper also presents useful conclusions to develop future research as well as to improve practices for decision makers.}

The study presented in this paper addresses the expansion of mill output to meet expected future demand by 2028 through application of a mixed-integer linear optimization model to (1) determine the amount of additional sugarcane production and mill processing capacity required to meet expected 2028 Brazilian ethanol and sugar demand and (2) optimize the location of this additional capacity to minimize production and transportation costs through the multimodal transportation network. Modeling results estimate that 151,106 t of additional sugarcane processing capacity is needed to meet forecast 2028 Brazilian demand for 41,106 m³ of sugarcane ethanol and 49,106 t of sugar. Expanded mill output will require that sugarcane cultivation increase over an additional 6% of the area defined by Brazilian Sugarcane Agroecological Zoning regulations as suitable for sugarcane cultivation. Following the model's recommended optimal spatial distribution of 2028 mill processing capacity, their output can be produced and transported at a total cost of US$ 458.65/m³ of ethanol and US$ 304.27/t of sugar, slightly below 2016 minimum total costs.}

The first two phases happen before a disaster and the last two after it. This survey focuses on casualty management (CM), which is one of the actions taken in the response phase of a disaster. Right after a severe disaster strikes, we may be confronted with a large number of casualties in a very short period of time. These casualties are in need of urgent treatment and their survival depends on a rapid response. Therefore, managing resources in the first few hours after a disaster is critical and efficient CM can significantly increase the survival rate of casualties. Uncertainty in the location of a disaster, disruption to transportation networks, scarcity of resources and possible deaths of rescue and medical teams due to the disaster in such situations make it hard to manage casualties. In this survey, we focus on CM for disasters where the following five steps are taken, respectively: (i) Resource dispatching/search and rescue, (ii) on-site triage, (iii) on-site medical assistance, (iv) transportation to hospitals and (v) triage and comprehensive treatment. With a special focus on Operations Research (OR) techniques, we categorize the existing research papers and case studies in each of these steps. Then, by critically observing and investigating gaps, trends and the practicality of the extant research studies, we suggest future directions for academics and practitioners.}

abstract = {This paper explores both random and class-based storage policies and three shuttle dispatching rules, random, distance-based, and demand-rate based, for a tier-to-tier shuttle-based storage and retrieval system (SBS/RS). Modeling the system as a discrete-time Markov Chain, this study derived the shuttle distribution under each policy combination, and further developed the expected travel time models for both single-command (SC) and dual-command (DC) operations. The developed models can help a warehouse designer or manager to comprehensively make four decisions for SBS/RS, whether SC or DC operations should be adopted, the most appropriate storage policy, the best shuttle dispatching rule, and the number of shuttles. The travel time models can evaluate each possible policy combination quickly through multiple criteria, such as the capacity, customer responsiveness, and costs of shuttles. Numerical experiments showed significant impacts of the policy combination on the expected travel time. Class-based storage, if implementable, is always better than random storage under each combination of shuttle dispatching rule and operational mode (i.e., SC or DC). Under random storage and SC operations, the distance-based shuttle dispatching rule is always better than the random rule, and their difference is concave in the number of shuttles. When classed-based storage is adopted and the number of shuttles is small, the demand-rate-based rule is the best under SC operations. Its benefit becomes more obvious when demand rates become more heterogeneous until some point but decreases as the system has more shuttles. Under DC Operations, depending on equipment speeds, the distance-based shuttle dispatching rule can be worse than the random rule under random storage. Under class-based storage and DC operations, the demand-rate-based rule is still the best when demand rates are heterogeneous. The differences between SC and DC operations are more significant when demand rates are more homogenous. When a system wants to be more responsive to customers, it should be run under SC operations. If the overall capacity is of interest, DC operations are much better.}

Greenhouse gas emissions are calculated as a function of fuel consumed, and fuel consumption levels are accurately calculated as a function of vehicle speed, load and traveled distance. To solve the problem efficiently, we develop an exact method based on Benders decomposition to find high-quality solutions in reasonable time. To enhance the convergence rate of the Benders decomposition algorithm, we present several acceleration strategies, such as addition of valid inequalities to the master problem and warm-up start. The warm-up start acceleration strategy itself is a meta-heuristic based on the greedy random adaptive search procedure (GRASP) and mathematical programming formulations. We present computational results which illustrate the superior performance of the proposed solution methodology in solving large-scale instances with 60 customers and 6 planning periods with 4 vehicles using Benders decomposition. Additionally, we show that utilizing a more comprehensive model to calculate the fuel cost results in fuel savings of 2 to 11% on the tested instances compared to traditional models that assume that the fuel cost is solely a function of the distance traveled during delivery.}

This paper presents a model developed to conduct detailed financial analysis of an offshore wind farm. It extends the current state of the art by employing stochastic time-series simulation modules performing in-depth analysis of the technologies, strategies and procedures applied during the installation, operation and maintenance, and decommissioning phases of a wind farm lifecycle. The model was designed for versatility and can consider both fixed and floating technologies, a wide variety of strategies, and any site specified by the user. Results include energy production, costs and the duration of activities at each stage. These populate financial spreadsheets, which calculate key performance indicators including the Levelised Cost of Energy. The model has been successfully validated against real-life case-studies where possible; published data; and uses sensitivity analysis to ensure the model is working as expected. Through a case-study, the paper demonstrates how 1) the model enables the identification of key cost and time drivers, facilitating scenario optimisation; 2) the stochastic nature of the model considers the impact of uncertain variables on results such as weather conditions and wind turbine failure rates; 3) the model can be used to assess different business models and financing structures. This comprehensive range of abilities means that the model is suited to a variety of end-users and meets the demands of a growing industry, striving to achieve further cost-reductions across a range of site conditions, technologies and markets.}

To this end, we focused on the lack and unavailability of delivery areas (DAs), defined as spaces where delivery vehicles may park for final deliveries. Their absence leads drivers to double-park. To minimize the impact of this problem, a field study was initially conducted, followed by an Integer Linear Program formulation of the DAs' problem, with emphasis on their location, number, and usage. By solving this problem, we could optimize the location of DAs taking into account stores assigned to them and their respective delivery demands. Subsequently, we evaluated the impact of double-parking and the DAs' optimization on urban congestion through a new method combining optimization and simulation. This approach is tested on a french case study. Finally, detailed numerical simulation results of various generated instances of traffic highlight the strong relationship between urban traffic congestion and number, use, and location of DAs.}

The paper fills this research gap, by using stated preferences to estimate market shares for e-grocery, distinguishing between home deliveries and click&pick, using the in-store option as a reference, and by considering a case study in Norway. It investigates the role of various purchase characteristics (i.e. product price, service cost, lead-time, time window, travel time and product range) when choosing which purchase channel to use. Results suggest that the most important characteristics for consumers are related to price, in particular product price, but there is also significant heterogeneity in preferences within the sample. Scenario simulations allow estimating transport and environmental impacts deriving from channel market share changes. This information can be useful for developing both managerial strategies to increase e-grocery market share and public policy interventions to minimize negative externalities.}

This paper formulates the resource allocation problem in contingency planning as a two-stage stochastic optimization problem with a risk-averse recourse function. The solution method proposed relies on an inexact proximal bundle method with subgradient approximations through a scenario reduction mechanism. The paper extends the inexact oracle to a more general risk-averse setting, and proves that it meets the requirements of the oracle in the inexact bundle method, ensuring convergence to an optimal solution. The practical performance of the developed inexact bundle method under risk aversion is investigated for our resource allocation problem. We create a library of test problems and obtain their optimal values by applying the exact bundle method. The computed solutions from the developed inexact bundle method are compared against these optimal values, under different coherent risk measures. Our analyses indicate that our inexact bundle method significantly reduces the computational time of solving the resource allocation problem in comparison to the exact bundle method, and is capable of achieving a high percentage of optimality within a much shorter time.}

The aim of the first project stage was to check whether the actual situation can be improved by further qualification measures. A simulation model was developed to analyze different qualifications of the employees and load scenarios of the shipping division. Various difficulties arose due to different shipping materials (coils with horizontal or vertical axis, and panels) and different types of loading (truck, wagon, ship, container). Furthermore, modeling was hampered by fuzzy descriptions of work processes and the lack of time data. For these reasons, the model had to simplify reality. After validating the simulation model based on historical order data, predicted load scenarios were then assumed for the actual investigation. The deployment of specialists led to only minor deterioration in wagon and truck loading, and on the other hand, the lead times of ship and container loading were reduced. However, the universalists approach was accompanied by an increase in lead times for all types of shipping. Therefore, the recommendation was derived to work towards a stronger specialization in future personnel development. In a second project stage, the influence of working time systems on employees’ work-life balance was examined. The statistical analysis showed different effects with regard to the target criteria, but the results were only valid for the regarded shipping division.}

Waste liquid crystal display (LCD) screen, once removed from their host devices, are an example of such a material. An economic model has been developed for estimating the amount of material that could be consolidated at a central recycling facility for processing by optimizing for the internal rate of return (IRR) for constructing and operating such a facility. The results show that the population density and high landfill tipping fees of the northeastern United States make New York and New Jersey the states associated with the highest IRR. Process sensitivity analyses reveal that for standard grade commodities produced from LCD glass, only nine states – all in the northeastern US – exhibit an IRR greater than 10% and only process about one third of the US and Canada’s LCD screen waste. For a recycler producing a high value liquid crystal product and a value-added glass product from the same waste, the impact of transportation costs becomes negligible and a facility could be operated in a state of one’s choosing to process all of the US and Canada’s waste with little impact on IRR. For the principal processing flow sheet investigated, the optimal plant capacity is estimated to be about 11,000 tonnes per year.}

It affects international shipping and requires all vessels to use fuel with a maximum of 0.5% sulphur content or use abatement technologies that achieve a similar reduction in SOx emissions. The existing legislative framework poses several challenges, stemming mainly from a highly non-homogeneous and spatially differentiated system, with cases where the penalty fines are as low as the benefit that the violator enjoyed from non-compliances. The purpose of this paper is to develop a game theoretic modelling framework that improves the effectiveness of sulphur regulations enforcement and proposes a uniform violation fine system. A mixed strategy game with two players is formulated, representing the ship operator (who can either comply or not with the regulation), and an enforcement agency (that can opt to inspect or not inspect the ship) respectively. The proposed model can improve compliance rates and increase societal environmental benefits through reduced sulphur emissions. We also consider a new system with warnings issued for repeated violations of the regulation that would lead to a mandatory retrofit of the vessel with sulphur abatement technologies. Such models can ensure a level playing field for ship operators that currently have invested heavily in abatement options to comply with the sulphur regulations.}

With regard to the environmental sustainability of LFM, previous research has focused on life-cycle assessment and the climate impact of energy generation using refuse-derived fuel from mined landfills. These studies were commonly based on hypothetical models paying little attention to emissions resulting from operations (e.g. excavation, processing, transportation). Since LFM involves a broad range of stakeholders, the objective of the present study is to investigate LFM empirically in a regional context using data from eight mined landfills in Germany. A material flow analysis, which included a calculation of energy consumption and related emissions from operations, was carried out and factors affecting material flows were determined based on environmental scanning. LFM operations required on average 103 MJ diesel (≙2.4 kg) and 1.9 MJ electricity per tonne excavated waste, producing 12 kg of CO2 equivalent. Transportation proved to be the sub-process with the largest energy consumption by far, producing 58% of total emissions, followed by processing (27%). The average transportation distance was 122 km; however - in contrast to previous studies - transportation distances for recovered soils (84 km) and asphalt (175 km) were considerably longer. Decisive for energy consumption were: a) the option of excavating waste lifts one at a time, b) an on-site processing option, c) processability of waste, and d) an on-site reuse option and/or nearby recovery facilities for soils. Flexibility, pragmatism and coordination of stakeholders proved to be key factors due to the complex and individual character of LFM projects as well as numerous interfaces.}

The problem consists of two hierarchical subproblems: locating water taps to ensure a good coverage of the population, and connecting these water taps to water sources by means of a pipe distribution network. Both subproblems are subject to a variety of accessibility and technical constraints that make the problem unique and highly complex. Namely, because Nepal is highly mountainous, elevations must be taken into account in the distance calculations, and the distribution network is gravity-fed, meaning that pumps are not used. The problem is solved by means of a two-phase matheuristic: the first subproblem is a constrained location–allocation problem which is solved exactly by integer linear programming, while the second subproblem is tackled by means of a cluster-first, tree-second heuristic. Several variants of the heuristic are developed and compared. The network design problem is of very large scale, being solved on a graph with as many as 29,900 vertices and 75,200 arcs. Tests are performed on real-world data, obtained by satellite imagery, from the Suspa Kshemawati and Lapilang communities in the Dolakha district. Extensive computational results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed methodology and enable an identification of the best parameter settings and algorithmic tactical choices.}

abstract = {Many humanitarian organizations aid en route refugee groups who are on their journey to cross borders using mobile facilities and need to decide the number and routes of the facilities. We define a multi-period facility location problem in which both the facilities and demand are mobile on a network. Refugee groups may enter and exit the network in different periods and follow various paths. In each period, a refugee group moves from one node to an adjacent one in their predetermined path. Each facility should be located at a node in each period and provides service to the refugees at that node. Each refugee should be served at least once in a predetermined number of consecutive periods. The problem is to locate the facilities in each period to minimize the total setup and travel costs of the mobile facilities, while ensuring the service requirement. We call this problem the multi-period mobile facility location problem with mobile demand (MM-FLP-MD) and prove its NP-hardness. We formulate a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model and develop an adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm (ALNS) to solve large-size instances. We tested the computational performance of the MILP and the metaheuristic algorithm by extracting data from the 2018 Honduras Migration Crisis. For instances solved to optimality by the MILP model, the proposed ALNS determines the optimal solutions faster and provides better solutions for the remaining instances. By analyzing the sensitivity to different parameters, we provide insights to decision-makers.}

abstract = {This paper describes the creation, development, implementation and impact of a system optimizing the distribution of petroleum products by pipeline at Empresa Nacional del Petroleo, the state-owned oil company in Chile. Refined oil products are sent via a pipeline from a refinery in the South to terminals located between the refinery and the center of the country. The sequencing of different products needs to be determined. This scheduling used to be done by hand, based on experience and on the need to satisfy physical constraints in the pipeline, supply constraints in and out of the refinery and demand constraints from clients. The complexity of the problem and the need to cut down on operating costs suggested turning to optimization, specifically integer programming. The positive results of the project owe a lot to the constant interaction between schedulers, decision makers, and the optimization team, and to the insights provided by the schedulers that allowed to limit the model’s complexity. The resulting system is easy to use for schedulers thanks to a graphical user interface (GUI), and its solution requires little computer time. It is used once a month for planning the next month operations and negotiating delivery dates and amounts with the clients based on the solution suggested by the model. In addition, in case of an operational disruption in the middle of a month, the model is run again after updating the parameters accordingly. Operating cost savings are of the order of 10%.}

abstract = {Urban last-mile distribution in emerging economies suffers from unique levels of operational complexity, largely due to the prevailing dominance of the highly fragmented traditional retail channel. To support companies in strategically designing efficient urban distribution networks in such uncertain market environments, we propose a large-scale stochastic mixed integer linear programming model that incorporates three commonly deployed measures of physical distribution flexibility. Being able to flexibly adjust transportation capacities, facility capacities, and demand allocations may enable companies to serve urban markets more efficiently, especially in the presence of demand uncertainty. The model supports strategic network design decisions by optimizing the number, type, and capacity of distribution facilities as well as the composition of corresponding vehicle fleets. We apply the model to two large-scale, real-world case studies based on real data from Coca-Cola Femsa’s last-mile operations in Bogotá and Cali, Colombia. These case studies are representative for many last-mile distribution problems in emerging market megacities. Our numerical results demonstrate how considering stochasticity and incorporating physical distribution flexibility in the strategic design of urban last-mile distribution networks jointly and independently affect the resulting network design and improve its commercial and operational performance. The stochastic design approach outperforms the deterministic design approach on every instance in terms of expected cost and performance risk. In most cases, physical distribution flexibility improves performance. However, we show that in some cases, if strategic decisions are based on deterministic assumptions, allowing for operational flexibility may result in a deterioration in network performance.}

This, together with the increasing volume of bulk transportation, make the efficient management of scarce resources such as berths a crucial option for enhancing the productivity of the overall terminal. In real scenarios, the information available to port operators may vary once the planning has been elaborated. Unforeseen events, errors, or modifications in the available information can lead to inefficient terminal management and the initial scheduling might become unfeasible. This implies that the use of deterministic approaches may not be enough to maximize productivity. Therefore, in this work, proactive simulation–optimization approaches that utilize the information collected during the simulation for guiding the optimization search to provide robust solutions are proposed. Moreover, a multi-objective approach based on the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) for jointly tackling the problem objective as well as the deviations because of stochastic changes is developed. Finally, we also investigate the contribution of time management strategies such as buffers to absorb stochastic modifications and hence increase solutions’ robustness. The computational results indicate, on the one hand, the benefit of integrating both types of objectives (i.e., deterministic and stochastic) to guide the simulation–optimization process, and on the other hand, the benefit of using the multi-objective approaches like NSGA-II. Finally, the incorporation of buffers leads to better performance in terms of reducing penalty costs due to disruptions, shortening the planning risks related to only considering deterministic planning.}

Mapping barriers in intermodal transportation both economic and environmental advantages particularly for long-distances, intermodal transport is still not utilized effectively, and it is challenged by many barriers to its utilization. On the other hand, the transport sector is influenced by recent trends, such as digitalization, Industry 4.0 and many technological innovations are introduced, aiming to transform the way of doing business. Therefore, understanding digitalization's potential to solve the transport sector's struggle for a higher degree of integration between different modes in intermodal transport is important. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the potential of different digital tools in mitigating barriers for increased utilization of intermodal transport. Semi-structured interviews and a policy Delphi study combined with a brainstorming session are conducted to classify various barriers for intermodal transport under certain categories and to understand if and how selected digital tools could help to mitigate these barriers. Findings indicate that the multi-actor nature of intermodal transport networks results in varying perceptions related with digital tools and technologies. This variance acts as a hindrance for digitalization within the conservative context of transportation industry and its cost-based competition structure. Adoption by market leaders, demand from intermodal transport buyers, vertical integration in intermodal transport chains are potential mitigation factors for elimination of barriers to digitalization in intermodal transportation.}

We employ off-the-shelf, pre-trained vectors created with the Global Vectors for Word Representation (GloVe) word embedding method from a data set crawled from the Internet. The Louvain method subsequently provides us with clusters based on remanufacturing and related terms, without requiring human interactions. Our findings provide the following main insights. First, remanufacturing and related terms are associated with specific industries and products, among which printing equipment, automobiles and car parts, treadmills, consumer electronics, and household appliances. Among the terms capturing remanufacturing activity, remanufactured, reconditioned, and rebuilt are strongly associated with business-to-business and slow clockspeed products, while refurbished is mostly associated with business-to-consumer and fast clockspeed products. Second, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are much more salient than independent remanufacturers, and Japanese OEMs are especially well represented as players in the market for remanufacturing. Third, environmental concerns only appear weakly in the discourse surrounding product recovery, while consumers do seem to place emphasis on quality and price. In a final part of the study, we contrast the CLSC academic literature with the clusters obtained through our big data analysis, thereby identifying industries, products, and brands that are understudied. We also outline the practical implications of our work for managers involved in setting up a remanufacturing strategy, as well as regulators.}

As a case study we consider transportation of by-product hydrogen from chlor-alkali and chlorate plants to a single industrial customer, which was considered to have the greatest potential for the LOHC technology to enter the markets. The results show that the LOHC delivery chain could significantly improve the economics of long distance road transport.

Each request is associated with a time window. The company managing the distribution has a given fleet of vehicles to serve the customers, and, in addition, occasional drivers are available to perform the service, i.e., private citizens who are willing to distribute some customer orders in exchange for a compensation. Each occasional driver specifies the time window in which he/she is available. A penalty is incurred when violating time windows as well as when a request is not served. The objective of the company is to determine the distribution plan that minimises the distribution cost, which is given by the sum of the cost of regular vehicles, the compensation paid to the occasional drivers and the penalty cost. In addition, we design and implement a solution method which is based on an insertion algorithm evaluating each request singularly. Albeit being simple, this approach allows to handle dynamic requests and to adjust the distribution plan in real-time. Then, we propose a re-optimisation approach in which the solution constructed through the insertion algorithm is periodically passed to a variable neighborhood search algorithm. In a detailed computational study, we analyse the behavior of the proposed solution approaches. In addition, we evaluate the impact of dynamic information through a comparison of online approaches with an a priori information scenario.}

The HFW is an airship that stays at high altitudes and uses unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to deliver supplies. This innovation will enable safe and timely delivery to hard-to-reach populations in a manner that significantly exceeds the capacity of current practices. Crucially, the HFW eliminates the motivations behind many delivery disruptions. These disruptions are caused by asymmetric commons dilemmas: entities with different accessibility and power race to grab shared relief goods before others. The problem we address is the operation of HFW to make safe and timely delivery of critical items such as health supplies to the hard to reach populations. This study constitutes proof of concept for the HFW system in conflict zones through a multi-objective mathematical model. The validity of the system is verified via comparative analysis with a ground-based system in a realistic case study.}

Owing to the high-level demand uncertainty, initial multi-commodity distribution strategy may be imperfect, resulting in the unexpected cases that some relief centers have surplus commodities while others’ needs cannot be fully satisfied. Consequently, it is necessary to rebalance commodities among relief centers to enable their effective use. In this study, commodities rebalancing problem with traffic congestion under uncertainty is considered. Then, this problem is formulated as a bi-objective stochastic mixed-integer nonlinear programming model to minimize the expected total weighted unmet demand proportion and the expected total transportation time. Linearization and epsilon-constraint approaches are devised to solve the established model to obtain the non-dominated solutions. Finally, a case study is implemented to validate the proposed model and solution strategies. Computational results indicate that the proposed method is effective to facilitate the decision-making in the multi-commodity rebalancing problem in disaster response. Furthermore, relief-center weight, stock level, and transportation time play an indispensable role in designing the strategies regarding multi-commodity rebalancing in response to a disaster. Increasingly, this paper expects to not only validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the methodology but underline the importance of incorporation of traffic congestion, uncertainties, fairness principle into the commodity rebalancing problem.}

This study aims to minimize the cost and negative environmental effects. In order to find the best method to solve the problem of multiobjective function optimization, we propose a multiobjective location model which combines genetic algorithm with probabilistic robust optimization. The model first uses genetic algorithm to get preliminary result and then it uses probabilistic robust optimization to find the optimal solution. The preliminary results show that 1, 3, 5 of the candidate sites more cost-effective and environmentally friendly than other. The fitness value converges at a stable value of 1.55 × 10−5, and the Pareto optimal frontier presents considerable clustering characteristics, which prove the rationality and operability of the site selection optimization model. Meanwhile, the robust model analysis under the given uncertain environment achieves the purpose of further optimization of the site.

abstract = {E-commerce retailers face the challenge to assemble large numbers of time-critical picking orders, of which each typically consists of just a few order lines and low order quantities. To efficiently solve this task, many warehouses in this segment are organized according to the mixed-shelves paradigm. Incoming unit loads are isolated into single units, which are randomly spread all over the shelves of the warehouse. In such a setting, the probability that a picker always finds a demanded stock keeping unit (SKU) close-by is high, irrespective of his/her current position in the warehouse. In spite of this organizational adaption, picker routing, i.e., the sequencing of shelf visits when retrieving a set of picking orders, is still an important optimization problem. In a mixed-shelves warehouse, picker routing is much more complex than in traditional environments: Multiple orders are concurrently assembled by each picker, many alternative depots are available, and items of the same SKU are available in multiple shelves. This paper defines the resulting picker-routing problem in mixed-shelves warehouses and provides efficient solution methods. Furthermore, we use the developed methods to explore important managerial aspects. Specifically, we benchmark mixed-shelves storage against traditional storage policies for scenarios with different ratios between small-sized and large-sized orders. In this way, we investigate whether mixed-shelves storage is also a suitable policy if an omni-channel sales strategy is pursued, and large-sized orders of brick-and-mortar stores as well as small-sized online orders are to be jointly processed by the same warehouse.}

These systems are subject to different failure types, and for each failure, a service engineer with the necessary spare part has to be assigned to repair the system. The service provider follows a backlogging policy with part reservations. That is, a repair request is backlogged if one of the required resources is not immediately available upon demand. Moreover, a spare part is reserved if the requested spare part is in stock but no service engineer is immediately available. The spare parts are typically slow-movers and are managed according to a base-stock policy. The objective is to jointly determine the stock levels and the number of service engineers to minimize the total service costs subject to a constraint on the expected total waiting times of the repair calls. For the evaluation of a given setting, we present an exact method (computationally feasible for small problems) and an accurate approximation. For the joint optimization, we present a greedy heuristic that efficiently produces close-to-optimal results. We test how the heuristic performs compared to the optimal solution and the separate optimization of spare parts and service engineers in an extensive numerical study. In a case study with 93 types of spare parts, we show that the solution of the greedy algorithm is always within 2% of the optimal solution and is up to 20% better than a separated optimization approach encountered in practice.}

A discrete event simulation model of grain transportation was developed to evaluate how truck and driver resource constraints impact material flow efficiency, resource utilization, and system throughput. Harvest rate and in-field transportation were represented as a stochastic entity generation process, and service times associated with various material handling steps were represented by a combination of deterministic times and statistical distributions. The model was applied to data collected for three distinct harvest scenarios (18 total days). Wheat and corn harvest from a large Kentucky operation was selected to evaluate the effect of different harvest rates (in wheat and corn), and corn harvest from a smaller Michigan operation was used to assess how the model handled situations where a single operator shuttled multiple trucks. The observed number of daily deliveries was within ±2 standard deviations of the simulation for 15 of the 18 input conditions examined, and on a daily basis, the median error between the simulated and observed deliveries was −4.1%. This model can be used to simulate how changes in vehicle and labor constraints impact the overall system performance. An important extension of this concept is that, given an existing equipment set and labor force, a producer can estimate how often grain transportation is the system bottleneck and simulate the impact of additional vehicles or labor on grain transportation efficiency.}

In this paper we present an analysis using simulation techniques for understanding the impact in a security area of an important airport in Latin America; the airport of Mexico City. The results allow to illustrate the potential congestion given by the implemented covid-19 restriction, even when the traffic recovers only by 25% of the pre-covid-19 traffic. The congestion can be mitigated by applying some layout changes (snake queue vs parallel queue) and when more capacity is added to the system (extra security line). The results will raise situational awareness for airport stakeholders when implementing the actions suggested by different international institutions like WHO, IATA or ICAO.}

abstract = {Cities, retailers, and delivery services are trying to find more environmental friendly solutions for last mile delivery. One very promising and partly used option are cargo bicycles. A critical factor of cargo bicycles is their travel speed, which depends on the mass of the load and the gradient of the chosen streets. Therefore, we define load-dependent travel speed and introduce the vehicle routing problem with load-dependent travel times (VRPLTT). We introduce a mixed-integer programming formulation and show the benefits of considering load-dependent travel times in last mile delivery with cargo bicycles. To efficiently solve larger instances, we develop an adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS). For the numerical study, we introduce a new set of instances and show that the travel time can be reduced by 4.5% on average and up to 22% compared to the vehicle routing problem with time windows. Moreover, ignoring the load-dependent travel times can lead to the underestimation of travel time in such a way that time windows are violated.}

Research on freight activity generated by offices is very limited because they are not seen as important contributors to urban freight traffic, and because the amount of deliveries per office is very small compared to the number of deliveries per establishment in freight-intensive sectors (e.g., retail, wholesale, manufacturing). However, the number of offices in cities is so large that altogether they represent a significant share of urban deliveries and generate a nonnegligible share of urban freight traffic. Hence, the relevance of quantifying their freight trip generation. This paper uses the City of Stockholm as a case study. The author collected data from offices and other establishments, estimated regression models and applied them to the city. The results show that offices represent 36% of establishments in Stockholm, 62% of employees and are responsible for 15% of freight trips generated in the city.}

Their advanced hardware and control software allow autonomous operations in dynamic environments. Compared to an automated guided vehicle (AGV) system in which a central unit takes control of scheduling, routing, and dispatching decisions for all AGVs, AMRs can communicate and negotiate independently with other resources like machines and systems and thus decentralize the decision-making process. Decentralized decision-making allows the system to react dynamically to changes in the system state and environment. These developments have influenced the traditional methods and decision-making processes for planning and control. This study identifies and classifies research related to the planning and control of AMRs in intralogistics. We provide an extended literature review that highlights how AMR technological advances affect planning and control decisions. We contribute to the literature by introducing an AMR planning and control framework to guide managers in the decision-making process, thereby supporting them to achieve optimal performance.

Taking into account the goal to achieve a 30% share of vehicle electric, the number of charging stations available in the entire European Union is not sufficient.

This may be due to the lack of available infrastructure which would render it possible to power them, and also from the lack of available delivery vehicles in the market. What is interesting, the number of electric vehicles in a country is not necessarily in proportion to the number of available charging stations. It is the authors' intention as well to indicate the potential directions of the development of a low-emission cargo transport in the European Union. Upon the basis of the results, it is ascertained that there is a strong correlation between the value of a country's GDP and the number of electric vehicle charging stations.

However, seasonal variability in algae growth presents a challenge to delivering a consistent feedstock supply to a conversion facility. Drying is one approach to preserving algae produced in productive summer months for conversion in winter, but is energy intensive and costly. Ensiling is an alternative to drying that preserves algae in wet anaerobic conditions in the presence of organic acids. We have previously demonstrated that dry matter loss of algae:corn stover blends can be limited to 8% over 35 days using this approach. However, longer storage durations will be required to maintain a consistent feedstock supply to a biorefinery. Furthermore, the impacts to biomass quality that occur during storage are unknown. A Box-Behnken design of experiment was conducted to determine the influence of moisture, soluble sugar, and algae content on dry matter loss of algae:corn stover blends in wet anaerobic storage over a 30-day period. Using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) moisture and soluble sugar content were found to significantly affect dry matter loss in storage. The results of experimental design were then used to inform the initiation of a 180 day storage study that evaluated the storage performance and biomass composition of algae:corn stover blends containing 5, 20 or 40% algae. After 180 days of storage dry matter loss ranged from 6 to 17%. A relative increase in nitrogen content of stored blends indicates that protein content was unaffected by storage, while the carbohydrate fraction was most impacted, decreasing by 5–15%. For each stored blend the oxygen content decreased in storage resulting increased higher heating values (HHV). The impact that changes to biochemical and elemental composition of algae:corn stover blends has on biomass conversion to fuels and chemicals is discussed.}

We propose an integer linear programming (ILP) model to formulate the TDEVRP and show that the state-of-the-art commercial optimizer (CPLEX) can only solve instances of very limited sizes (with no more than 15 customers). We thus propose an iterated variable neighbourhood search (IVNS) algorithm to find near-optimal solutions for larger instances. The key ingredients of IVNS include a fast evaluation method that allows local search moves to be evaluated in constant time O(1), a variable neighbourhood descent (VND) procedure to optimize the node sequences, and a departure time and speed optimization procedure(DSOP) to optimize the speed and departure time on each arc of the routes. The proposed algorithm demonstrates excellent performances on a set of newly created instances. In particular, it can achieve optimal or near-optimal solutions for all small-size instances (with no more than 15 customers) and is robust for large-size instances where the gap between the average and the best solution value is consistently lower than 2.38%. Additional experimental results on 40 benchmark instances of the closely related Time-Dependent Pollution Routing Problem indicate that the proposed IVNS algorithm also performs very well and even discovers 39 new best-known solutions (improved upper bounds).}

abstract = {Background
Frequently, a country will procure a single vaccine vial size, but the question remains whether tailoring the use of different size vaccine vial presentations based on populations or location characteristics within a single country could provide additional benefits, such as reducing open vial wastage (OVW) or reducing missed vaccination opportunities.
Methods
Using the Highly Extensible Resource for Modeling Supply Chains (HERMES) software, we built a simulation model of the Zambia routine vaccine supply chain. At baseline, we distributed 10-dose Measles-Rubella (MR) vials to all locations, and then distributed 5-dose and 1-dose MR vials to (1) all locations, (2) rural districts, (3) rural health facilities, (4) outreach sites, and (5) locations with average MR session sizes <5 and <10 children. We ran sensitivity on each scenario using MR vial opening thresholds of 0% and 50%, i.e. a healthcare worker opens an MR vaccine for any number of children (0%) or if at least half will be used (50%).
Results
Replacing 10-dose MR with 5-dose MR vials everywhere led to the largest reduction in MR OVW, saving 573,892 doses (103,161 doses with the 50% vial opening threshold) and improving MR availability by 1% (9%). This scenario, however, increased cold chain utilization and led to a 1% decrease in availability of other vaccines. Tailoring 5-dose MR vials to rural health facilities or based on average session size reduced cold transport constraints, increased total vaccine availability (+1%) and reduced total cost per dose administered (−$0.01) compared to baseline.
Conclusions
In Zambia, tailoring 5-dose MR vials to rural health facilities or by average session size results in the highest total vaccine availability compared to all other scenarios (regardless of OVT policy) by reducing open vial wastage without increasing cold chain utilization.}

Vendor-managed inventory (VMI) has been suggested as a form of cooperation that can reduce economic and environmental impacts of transportation and consequently improve eco-efficiency of the supply chain. Establishing viable forms of VMI cooperation requires a fair distribution of the cooperation's economic benefits. Cooperative game theory (CGT) research is used to fairly allocate both benefits and costs. However, the environmental contribution of partners has often been ignored in the benefit allocation. In this study, the Shapley value (a commonly used CGT method) is used to share the monetary gains in a way that reflects the partners' contributions to cost and emissions savings. The method is applied to evaluate the allocation of economic and environmental benefits of vendor-managed inventory between cooperating supermarket chains in the Netherlands. The findings show that there is a set of eco-efficient solutions resulting in lower costs and CO2 emissions compared to the current situation. For each of the eco-efficient solutions, the relative importance of saving costs and of saving emissions was quantified, and based on the importance weights, a cost allocation was found. For all partners that contribute to saving both cost and CO2 emissions, this approach results in cost savings, and therefore, the approach can be considered fair. Also, this approach helps to stimulate long-term eco-efficient forms of cooperation.}

However, many factors hinder the smooth implementation of intermodal systems, such as the high number of operators to be involved, the duplication of handling activities and transit times at the intersection of each transport mode, and the lack of information sharing among the different transport modes and companies. To overcome such barriers, Intelligent Communication Systems (ICS) have increasingly been applied to activities within the nodes (warehouses, transit points) and arches (transport routes) of distribution networks, providing several benefits, such as real-time visibility and tracking, more precise, reliable and efficient data collection, and document exchange. One of the key elements that can guarantee the successful design and implementation of an intermodal transport system is the integration of the various systems and actors involved along the process. This paper aims to contribute to this issue by presenting some of the results of the “ITS Italy 2020” project, an applied research initiative financed by the Italian Government to foster the diffusion of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS). More specifically, we illustrate a prototype solution, based on a software that allows managing and monitoring freight transport along an intermodal network, thus overcoming some barriers currently limiting intermodal transport implementation. The prototype can communicate with devices and sensors put on board the vehicle or load, and track sensors positioned along the road. The solution integrates all the other systems involved by collecting and publishing information, managing events, and sending messages.}

We introduce four mathematical formulations for the problem, two with a vehicle index and two without a vehicle index, and propose branch-and-cut algorithms to solve them. In addition, we propose a hybrid heuristic based on the combination of an iterated local search metaheuristic and two mathematical programming components. We present the results of extensive computational experiments using instances from the literature as well as new larger instances. The results show the different advantages of the introduced formulations and show that the hybrid method is able to provide high-quality solutions in relatively short running times for small- and medium-sized instances while good quality solutions are found within reasonable running times for larger instances. We also adapted the proposed hybrid heuristic to solve the basic variant of the inventory routing problem. The results using standard instances show that our heuristic is also able to find good quality solutions for this problem when compared to the state-of-the-art methods from the literature.}

This paper introduces the concept of the demand correlation pattern (DCP) to describe the correlation among items, based on which a new model is constructed to address the SLAP. The model is subsequently reduced using the S-shape routing strategy, and a method for determining DCPs from historical data is proposed. To solve the model, a heuristic and a simulated annealing method are developed. The proposed methods are examined and compared extant methods using both real data collected from an online retailer and numerical instances that are randomly generated.

One of the basic ways to improve order-picking operation is assigning storage locations to appropriate items. The storage location assignment problem is in general NP-hard and is mainly solved by heuristics which usually suffer from limited solution quality or high computational effort, especially for large scale problems. In literature, most studies make the storage assignment decisions according to item properties, such as turnover or correlation, which are statistically extracted from item orders. These storage methods follow a data→concept→assign decision mechanism and may ignore useful data characteristics that are not conceptualized. This paper presents a new approach to improve the order-picking operation, which directly uses item orders to make the decisions without any statistical treatments, i.e., following a data→assign mechanism. The concept of good move pair is introduced to quickly find a better assignment through directly exploiting data characteristics of item orders, and an iterative algorithm is developed to minimize the total travel distance. We evaluate the algorithm on real data and numerical instances, and compare its performance with extant methods in the literature. The results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms other methods in most cases. We also extend the algorithm to the case of high-level warehouses and examine its effectiveness.}

Moreover, inbound trucks do not need to unload and reload the demand of allocated destination, i.e. they can be partially unloaded. The problem is modeled as a mixed integer program to find the optimal dock-door and destination assignments as well as the scheduling of trucks to minimize makespan. Due to model complexity, a hybrid heuristic-simulated annealing is developed. A number of generic and tailor-made neighborhood search structures are also developed to efficiently search solution space. Moreover, some reinforcement learning methods are applied to intellectually learn more suitable neighborhood search structures in different situations. Finally, the numerical study shows that partial unloading of compound trucks has a crucial impact on makespan reduction.}

abstract = {Purpose
In several biomedical studies, one or more exposures of interest may be subject to nonrandom missingness because of the failure of the measurement assay at levels below its limit of detection. This issue is commonly encountered in studies of the metabolome using tandem mass spectrometry–based technologies. Owing to a large number of metabolites measured in these studies, preserving statistical power is of utmost interest. In this article, we evaluate the small sample properties of the missing indicator approach in logistic and conditional logistic regression models.
Methods
For nested case-control or matched case control study designs, we evaluate the bias, power, and type I error associated with the missing indicator method using simulation. We compare the missing indicator approach to complete case analysis and several imputation approaches.
Results
We show that under a variety of settings, the missing indicator approach outperforms complete case analysis and other imputation approaches with regard to bias, mean squared error, and power.
Conclusions
For nested case-control and matched study designs of modest sample sizes, the missing indicator model minimizes loss of information and thus provides an attractive alternative to the oft-used complete case analysis and other imputation approaches.}

Our approach enables the consideration of endogenous learning, where the service times are dependent on the experience that is to be gained in the same routing horizon. We apply our approach to the problem of planning an offshore plug and abandonment campaign, where different vessels are being used to perform plugging operations on offshore oil and gas wells. We extend existing instances for this problem with observed learning data and investigate the effects of learning and cooperation. Results show that the inclusion of an endogenous learning effect leads to different and significantly better solutions compared to those that are found when the learning effect is neglected.}

A booking management system and the related routing problem are presented. In this system, distributors book in sequence according to their preferences and routing constraints, but subject to the bookings that have already been placed. The solution provided by the booking system is discussed and compared with the current use of the L/U areas, where the distributors do not consider the availability of a parking spot and resort to double parking if none is available.}

It can be defined as the problem of determining the disassembly quantity and timing of the used-products to fulfill the demand of their parts over a finite planning horizon. This paper considers the case of multiple product types with parts commonality and the objective is to minimize the sum of setup, disassembly operation, and inventory holding costs. High inventory holding cost can be generated: because of disparity between independent and unbalanced demands, and the disassembly of one unit of used-product generates all the parts with different ratios. Aggregate formulation (AGG) can be used to model this problem by considering disposal decisions. Linear-Programming (LP) relaxation of this model doesn’t give very good lower bound, especially for the large-sized instances. We aim to improve lower bound of the problem. Facility Location-based formulation (FAL) is developed which can obtain optimal or near optimal solution by using LP relaxation approach. A two-phase heuristic is proposed which constructs an initial solution by using LP relaxation approach, and then improves by a dynamic programming based heuristic. Computational experiments are conducted on randomly generated test problems which show that the models and methods can give optimal or near-optimal solutions in very short computational times.}

abstract = {Biomass such as switchgrass can be converted to renewable gasoline and diesel (RGD) fuels via integrated fast pyrolysis and hydrodeoxygenation. However, the low bulk density of biomass feedstocks produces relatively high transportation costs, driven by the large volumes needed to supply biorefineries. Densification can reduce transportation volumes, and therefore transportation costs for bioenergy production. However, the additional costs of biomass densification, along with decreases in overall mass and energy yields, influence the overall economic performance of RGD production. This study investigated the techno-economic impacts of pelletizing, torrefying, or pyrolyzing the biomass at distributed facilities prior to upgrading the intermediates to RGD at a centralized facility. Eight scenarios were considered. When there is no feedstock competition, biomass densification at the distributed facility was shown to reduce the transportation cost by 20%–50%. However, the capital and operating costs required for densifying biomass increased the total cost of RGD production by 3%–35% compared to RGD made from non-densified biomass. The cost of making RGD from densified biomass was only reduced below the cost of making RGD from non-densified biomass for the case when the fraction of land surrounding the biorefinery facility allocated to the biomass cultivation is less than 0.25. This finding is attributed to the high cost of transporting non-densified biomass from a larger procurement radius. Sensitivity analysis indicated that RGD fuel yield, densification costs, project investment, and the rate of return all have significant impacts on the overall economics of RGD production.}

To mitigate such delays, researchers proposed the movement of idle ambulances between emergency bases as one of the effective ways to improve the areal coverage of future demands. In this study, we have developed a model-driven decision support system that simultaneously seeks to maximize demand coverage while minimizing travel time by optimally relocating emergency response vehicles. The developed mathematical model partitions and prioritizes demand into four categories and continuously updates them over time. Furthermore, it dynamically calculates the number of coverages in different regions based on the current location of idle ambulances. Also, we developed a real-time risk assessment DSS for recommended relocations, which could be utilized as a reference by the EMS user while implementing suggested relocation decisions. A real case study is used to validate the proposed DSS, and its final output is compared to the existing operational policy. The findings show that the average workload added to each ambulance due to relocations has significantly improved the response time and coverage ratio. Compared to the existing operational policy, the developed decision support system decreased the time to respond to calls, which was deemed to be more than to offsets the increase in travel time due to relocation. Furthermore, the system also reduced the total working time of all ambulances by about 9% per shift.}

The concentration of people in urban areas makes these increasingly requiring for primary products and services as food and energy, and the fulfilment of such needs result in significant carbon emissions. The inclusion of spatial functions as agriculture and renewables in the urban planning can address to this environmental impact, but would require support-planning tools able to explore new land-use allocation strategies within an integrated urban-rural ecosystem. In this paper, we propose an optimization framework for the planning of low carbon urban-rural ecosystems that integrates transport and land-use planning and cope with urban metabolism, involving urban mobility, food transportation, energy supplies. This framework contributes to the literature as it formulates a network between urban, agricultural, energy, and carbon mitigation land-covers and optimizes the horizontal carbon fluxes within an integrated urban-rural environment. In order to minimize carbon emissions by mobility and resources (i.e. food) transportation, the framework aids identifying trade-offs between accessibility and density over the spatial distribution of resource-generating and resource-consuming land-covers. Proof of concept is provided with a realistic numerical example, propelled by real-world data from an Italian region. The land-use allocation solution makes the exemplifying urban-rural ecosystem behaving as carbon sink due to the established green areas and the configuration of the spatial uses. A sensitivity analysis is finally carried out to assess the impacts of mobility and resources transportation on the spatial urban-rural structure and associated carbon emissions. It comes out that the optimal urban configuration to mitigate carbon emissions from transportation integrates urban and rural uses and guarantees accessibility to several functions as cultivated areas, renewables and green covers, responsible to provide food, energy and air cleaning respectively to dwellers.}

For the third formulation, we also assume that the arc costs are equal for all trucks, and then we prove that its continuous relaxation admits integer optimal solutions by checking that its constraint matrix is totally unimodular. Under the same hypothesis on costs, even the continuous relaxations of the first two models are proved to admit an integer optimal solution. Finally, the third model is transformed into a circulation problem, that can be solved by efficient network algorithms.}

Therefore, as well as establishing and retaining a solid OC base, using the OC trips efficiently is of utmost importance for the viability of the CS applications. One auspicious idea to enhance the efficiency, i.e., cover a larger demand set with the available OC trips, is to use transshipments (deliver packages with a coordinated effort of OCs) and collect OC trip information in advance to efficiently coordinate them, which gives rise to the package routing problem with registered couriers (PRP-R) we introduce in this paper. In particular, we study a CS model in which the couriers register their trips in advance while the express shipping demands arrive through a stochastic process, and the network management needs to dynamically decide package-courier assignments to carry out deliveries in the most efficient way. We develop a novel rolling horizon algorithm to solve this challenging problem in real-time, which explicitly considers the limited OC capacities and use of a back-up delivery capacity (company-owned or third party provided) to ensure the service quality. Beyond the classical rolling horizon approaches, the suggested methodology uses a novel Monte Carlo procedure to take anticipated future system conditions into account, and thus can provide package-courier assignments that have almost the same cost with the optimal solution of the static version of the problem where all demand arrivals are known a-priory. The comprehensive numerical experiments attest to the efficacy of our methodology for the real-time management of the CS operations and provide significant managerial insights about the design of CS networks.}

Moreover, it is not necessary for the company to visit all customer zones or to collect all returns in each visited customer zone.

We propose a branch and bound algorithm with new components for solving such difficult instances. We strengthen existing lower bounds and introduce two new lower bounds that use a relaxation of the pre-marshalling problem to provide tight bounds in specific situations. We introduce generalized dominance rules that help reduce the search space, and a memoization heuristic that finds feasible solutions quickly. We evaluate our approach on standard benchmarks of pre-marshalling instances, as well as on a new dataset to avoid overfitting to the available data. Overall, our approach optimally solves many more instances than previous work, and finds feasible solutions on nearly every problem it encounters in limited CPU times.}

The objective in RSP is to design daily tours for a traveling campaigner who collects rewards from activities in cities during a fixed planning horizon. RSP exhibits a number of exclusive features: It is selective which implies that not every node needs a visit. The rewards of cities are time-dependent. Daily tours can be either an open or a closed tour which implies the absence of a fixed depot. Instead, there is a campaign base that is to be attended frequently. Multiple visits are allowed for certain cities. The proposed method MS-GSVNTS is tested on 45 real-life instances from Turkey which are built with actual travel distances and times and on 10 large scale instances. Computational results suggest that MS-GSVNTS is superior to the existing solution methods developed for RSP. It produces 50 best known solutions including 18 ties and 32 new ones. The performance of MS-GSVNTS can be attributed to its multi-start feature, rich neighborhood structures, skewed moves, and granular neighborhoods.}

To fill this gap, we compared the results from gamified and non-gamified workshops conducted with Austrian students. A total of 384 individuals participated in this field experiment, 261 of whom were subjected to a multitude of gamified elements, while 123 served as a non-gamified control group. In the gamified context, the findings show a stronger influence of intrinsic motivation, as measured by enjoyment and curiosity, on attitude and behavioral intention, and a greater explanatory power of the model. Gamification therefore positively moderates the impact of exogenous motivational variables and amplifies the effect of intrinsic motivation.}

For the solution of more realistic-sized problem instances, a General Variable Neighborhood Search (GVNS)-based framework is adopted. Novel adaptive shaking methods are proposed as intelligent components of the developed GVNS algorithms to further improve their performance. To evaluate the proposed GVNS schemes, several problem instances are randomly generated by following specific instructions from the literature and adopting real vehicles’ parameters. Comparisons between these solutions and the corresponding ones achieved by CPLEX are made. The computational results indicate the efficiency of the proposed GVNS-based algorithms, with the best GVNS scheme to produce 7% better solutions than CPLEX for small problems. Finally, the economic and environmental impacts of using either homogeneous or heterogeneous fleet of vehicles are examined.}

It is designed such that no client has an incentive to claim a false due date or cost. The game mechanism allows the clients to move their jobs to complete earlier in a given schedule. However, they must compensate costs of those clients whose jobs miss their due dates because of these moves. Algorithmic aspects are analyzed. Furthermore, a polynomial time algorithm that determines an equilibrium of the considered game is suggested and embedded into the game mechanism. Computational tests analyze the performance and practical suitability of the resulting game mechanism.}
