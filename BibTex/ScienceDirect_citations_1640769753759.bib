abstract = {The logistics optimization problem has received immense attention in recent years. The existing optimization methods generally put forward distribution strategies based on physical distance or topological distance. Hence, they have inherent limitations on effectively optimizing the logistics network in real-life situations. In order to address these concerns, this paper proposes a novel optimization model based on the concept of effective distance. We first define the effective distance in logistics networks, and then implement the network optimization based on effective distance with a Physarum-inspired algorithm that overcomes the slow convergence rate of exact algorithms. The superiority of our proposed model is that suppliers can cooperate with each other to realize cost reduction, while products from different suppliers on each link remain differentiated. Numerical examples of a logistics network with multiple origin-destination pairs have shown that our proposed model (which considers both economies of scale and cooperation among suppliers in the distribution process) provides a reliable and effective cost minimization strategy. The computational performance of our proposed algorithm is also better than other algorithms such as the particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithm, as indicated in our experiments.}

Several key findings and potential research directions are presented in relation to research on cybersecurity in logistics and supply chain management. These findings are: (1) Existing studies rarely use real cybersecurity data; (2) Studies focusing on cybersecurity in logistics are scarce although logistics plays an important role in supply chains; (3) There is only a limited number of papers adopting quantitative research approaches to study cybersecurity in logistics and supply chain management; (4) While a few studies focus on real-time recovery and aftermath measures, most studies focus on precautionary measures; (5) Blockchain technologies are still in their infancy in the transport and logistics sector; (6) Most studies use one-way encryption schemes that overlook the potential threats in a future dominated by quantum computing techniques; (7) Studies on information security and digital forensic investigation are scarce.}

abstract = {Making deliveries of Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) to small retailers in dense areas is a challenge. This has different levels of impact between high-income and low-income neighborhoods. They are more evident in megacities in developing countries, where there is a clear division between classes. On the one hand, governments do not attend low-income neighborhoods where there are many unsafe areas, lack of planning, and infrastructure that hinders FMCG deliveries. On the other hand, traffic regulations in high-income neighborhoods make delivery processes more complex. This paper aims to analyze urban logistics, comparing low- and high-income areas in São Paulo city taking into account local markets, consumer buying behavior, and the distribution process. To achieve this, a questionnaire in loco was applied to the stakeholders involved (consumers, small retailers, and carriers). The data were analyzed by using descriptive statistics. The results from small retailers, consumers, and carriers reveal that in their point of view the delivery of products is different between Base of the Pyramid (BOP) and high-income consumers (HIC). Factors such as ‘time window regulation’ and ‘infrastructure of neighborhoods’ hinder the delivery of products from companies to small retailers in regions of HIC, while in BOP regions small retailers' security and infrastructure are the major problems from the point of view of the actors. Consumer behavior poses an important factor to guide urban freight transport planning in both regions.}

The results show that (1) internal motivation, support of external conditions and related subject influences have positive influences on the willingness to implement green coal logistics indirectly by promoting the general benefits, (2) internal barriers exert negative influences on the willingness to implement green coal logistics indirectly by driving the general benefits, (3) factors with positive influence, from strong to weak, are internal motivations, support of external conditions and related subject influences, and it turns out that the general benefits of green logistics has significantly positive effects on the willingness to implement green logistics, and (4) the policy system could directly affect the willingness to implement green logistics, which does not occur through the green logistics benefits.}

abstract = {This paper provides a systematic review of studies that model future autonomous vehicles (AVs) in urban mobility and logistics using an agent-based model (ABM). Eighty relevant papers published between 2015–2020 are included. This review evaluates the quality of each model through the newly developed AAODD (Autonomous vehicle Agent-based Overview, Design concepts and Details) protocol in four perspectives: model transparency, research questions, network+agent behaviour and model execution. Then, similarities and particularities of the papers are summarised based on whether AVs are used for passenger mobility or for freight logistics. The reviewed mobility papers exhibit the ABMs’ applicability and flexibility for studying different AV operational patterns. We summarise the respective modelling specifications in research questions, data collections, model platforms, model executions, and scenario variations. Overall, by combining AVs with different technical possibilities and operational strategies, the simulation results illustrate that AVs would bring vast benefits to urban mobility networks. Unlike AVs’ usage in passenger mobility, it is still unclear how AVs will serve future urban logistics demands. Many operational patterns, including unmanned aerial vehicles, autonomous robots, autonomous trucks, and autonomous cargo-hatching vehicles coexist in the research community. The number of relevant papers remains low due to the early stage of AV technology deployment. However, ABMs also prove their applicability for analysing the macro and mesoscopic impacts of freight AV transportation on urban network. The reviewed papers suggest that implementing AVs for urban logistics is more efficient and environmentally friendly than conventional delivery vehicles. Overall, ABMs are a powerful tool for simulating future urban scenarios with AVs. By calculating the average score of reviewed papers obtained via AAODD annually, we find that studies simulating AV systems in ABMs are getting more complex by combing diverse technological possibilities, supporting the simulation of more realistic future scenarios. The outcomes of reviewed ABM research reveals that AVs are a promising solution for solving current urban transport problems. Lastly, as nearly all current reviewed studies focus on AVs’ usages in either mobility or logistics, research on an integrated simulation that combines AVs for both purposes has been scarcely addressed. We discuss its necessities, possibilities, and opportunities in this paper, to steer future research in this direction.}

First, a mixed-integer linear programming model on the non-budget-sharing mechanism is formulated, which aims to minimize the total amount of CO2 emissions generated from freight transport activities within a regional logistics network. The other two mechanisms are addressed to compare their effects on the system performance of the regional network. To empirically assess the effectiveness of the three mechanisms, a case study based on Changsha-Zhuzhou-Xiangtan regional low-carbon logistics network design is investigated. The findings show that the performance of the conditional-budget-sharing mechanism is superior to the non-budget-sharing mechanism, but inferior to the centralized-budget-sharing mechanism. Furthermore, the designed investment coordination mechanisms and corresponding optimization models provide a coordinated reference for multiple cities regarding logistics park investment and low-carbon logistics network design.}

Focusing on refugee aid, it draws on qualitative fieldwork with practitioners in the field of humanitarian logistics, active in the partnership environment of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), in five countries (Greece, Jordan, Lebanon, Rwanda and Sweden). The analysis shows how aid workers see profit and non-profit partnerships for humanitarian logistics as a priority in the context of the so-called humanitarian-development nexus. In particular, logistics is considered essential to bring refugee aid in line with emerging standards of sustainability. The article puts forward a twofold argument. First, it shows how sustainability policies prioritize logistical solutions that are based on the integration of the displaced in local and transnational markets, rather than on the delivery of material goods and infrastructures. Second, in a slight departure from existing literature on humanitarian logistics, it argues that the agency of the humanitarian sector, and not just that of the corporate world, is central in the promotion of humanitarian logistics partnerships. The conclusions discuss the ethical and political implications of a humanitarianism increasingly oriented towards supply-chain rationales, in which more sustainable logistics often equates less material aid.}

Therefore, many new frameworks that can help a specific actor in its decision making process at a certain decision making level (i.e., business or policy level) have been implemented and published. However, the first screening of existing literature did not reveal frameworks that can be used across different decision making levels. This limits the possibility for actors using the same infrastructure but not necessarily co-operate to discuss how the actions and needs of each actor of different decision making levels mutually influence each other. This paper first presents an outcome of a literature review and analysis of existing research project results before. It combines these to a multi-layer framework that can enhance collaborative decision-making and seamless aggregation of performance measures such as environmental impact from multiple transportation activities in and around urban areas. For this multi-layer framework, factors are identified, and possible relationships across the various layers are indicated. The field of application is the area near urban manufacturing sites and specifically addressing all actors that share on regulate infrastructure relevant to last mile inbound logistics. The source of data is project databases as well as for the literature review research databases. The methodology applied is a combination of a literature review based on database entries and a snowball approach. The article also presents how the framework can be prototypically implemented in participatory simulations using a simplified example. Potential usage for establishing holistic urban mobility structures is also discussed.}

Such operations can be optimized by solving the Logistics Service Network Design Problem (LSNDP), wherein a logistics service provider seeks to cost-effectively source and fulfill customer demands of products within a multi-echelon distribution network. However, many industrial settings yield instances of the LSNDP that are too large to be solved in reasonable run-times by off-the-shelf optimization solvers. We introduce an exact Benders decomposition algorithm based on partial decompositions that strengthens the master problem with information derived from aggregated subproblem data. More specifically, the proposed Meta Partial Benders Decomposition intelligently switches from one master problem to another by changing both the amount of subproblem information to include in the master as well as how it is aggregated. Through an extensive computational study, we show that the approach outperforms existing benchmark methods and demonstrate the benefits of dynamically refining the master problem in the course of a partial Benders decomposition-based scheme.}

abstract = {Although the technology of autonomous vessels has developed rapidly in the past decade, the literature on the effects of this new technology on logistics and transportation is limited. Particularly, the potential operational changes brought by the autonomy of vessels are not discussed. Besides savings on crew, other benefits of autonomy, especially from an operational perspective, remain unclear. On the other hand, countries like Norway are facing significant challenges in their urban and rural logistics. The land-based public transportation system cannot efficiently serve the demands, especially for areas isolated or separated by fjords or rivers. Water-based transportation systems are thus very attractive, and autonomy makes such systems economically more viable. In this paper we focus on a potential case of autonomous water-taxis in Bergen, Norway. First, we identify the major operational differences, from a logistics perspective, between conventional manned water-taxis and autonomous ones. Then a mixed integer linear programming model is developed to tackle the facility location, fleet allocation and routing decisions in the daily operations of a water-taxi business. The model in this paper is used to analyse the problem, rather than designed for direct use during implementation. In the computational study, different cases with either conventional or autonomous water-taxis are tested. The results show that autonomy can lead to substantial savings on travelled distance due to number and locations of parking terminals being feasible only for autonomous systems.}

This study investigates this integrated concept, particularly for healthcare product distribution (i.e., hearing aids) to customers located within a city environment. We propose an efficient mathematical model to investigate various scenarios of integrated 3DP production and transportation planning and provide insightful analysis. It might seem counter-intuitive that tighter delivery time slots can improve the utilization of capacity and 3DP machines, but this study finds that intelligent selection of production and delivery policies can simultaneously benefit both customer and supplier.

Will logistics in Lagos, Cairo, Mumbai or Mexico one day resemble logistics in New York, Tokyo or London? Will methods from developed countries spread to developing ones? Will modern and traditional organisations converge, hybridise each other, or remain a divided dual system? Will original solutions emerge in developing countries? We show that urban logistics in developing countries is not integrated but dual, i.e. split between two distinct and coexisting types of organisation, management and business model. In addition, the results of this research project show that considering the three cases (India, Mexico, and Morocco) implicitly required a comparison with city logistics in developed countries, considered as the reference standard. As a result, analysing logistics in developing countries can advance knowledge not only on these countries but also, indirectly, on developed ones.}

abstract = {Background
Total knee replacement (TKR) is a complex operation and its conventional instrumentation system has around 300 pieces to perform and more than 50 technical steps. New techniques were introduced, such as patient-specific instrumentation (PSI), robotics, and navigation to facilitate the TKR operation. This study aims to compare the logistics between conventional instrumentation and patient-specific templating (PST) in the low-income setting.
Methods
We compared the logistics for the conventional and the PST techniques while performing TKR. The comparison included the number of instruments and trays, equipment delivery, packaging, sterilization, intraoperative setup, and post-operative handling.
Results
The surgical trays to complete one conventional TKR were 6–12 trays while for the PST, only one tray was needed. Conventional instruments can reach the hospital in 24 h while the delivery time of the PST may take from 3 to 5 days. The time needed to sterilize the conventional could be done overnight in the small hospitals as compared to a few hours in PST. In addition, PST has no special postoperative steps, unlike the conventional, which requires washing, delivery to a storage facility, re-washing, decontamination, packing, and storing till the next surgery.
Conclusion
The logistics for conventional instruments are more complex. Although there was no cost-effectiveness analysis, it has been observed that the PST technique has a positive effect on rationalizing resources by consuming less time in the central sterilization unit and reducing the operating time.}

The article suggests creating a mixed transport and logistics union and presents a macro-level scheme of the innovative infrastructure for this mixed transport and logistics union. The implementation of the strategy of minimizing the total logistics costs is complicated by the weak formalizability of the parameters of the quality of logistics services and the subjective assessment of the quality of service by consumers. The desire to take into account most of the key factors in the logistics strategy obviously leads to the need to apply the methodology of multi-criteria optimization. There are a number of methodologies and models that offer multimodal transport timing, for example, "network models", "additive and multiplicative models", but they all consider time at the level of the domestic market and, most often at the level of one organization, all this is micrologistics. The authors are interested in an innovative method for calculating the time that can be applied for export shipments in combination with the terms of Incoterms specified in contracts.}

By using qualitative variables like poverty levels, food insecurity and social exclusion, different clustering methods are proposed with the purpose of identifying the common characteristics in the studied population; and at the same time, reducing the distribution complexity. The results show an efficient approach to design a supply chain that includes economic and social factors. The new model developed in this paper can be used to plan social assistance governmental programs, to identify the specific needs and characteristics of the beneficiaries, minimizing the total cost of the distribution network logistics when delivering food for school meals.}

The stochastic frontier analysis revealed that the average annual value of logistics land use efficiency (LLUE) in the YEB increased from 0.547 in 2000 to 0.655 in 2017. The Tobit model revealed that all the explanatory variables had positive and significant relationship with the LLUE, with the exception of the tertiary sector and informatization. Importantly, Tobit models of three sub-samples revealed various development stages in the logistics industry across space: downstream cities may reach the plateau of LLUE through organic growth, while an increase in the land supply for logistics use could still be associated with an improvement of the LLUE of a logistics industry located upstream. Finally, we deduced that the inflection point of LLUE for organic growth in logistics land use in the YEB could be between 0.59 and 0.69 during the study period (or between 0.64 and 0.73 in 2017). It is inefficient for urban planners to increase land zoning for logistics use to pass the point of positive marginal return to the economy.}

This conceptual paper aims to explore challenges facing the strategic development of TPLs within a context of increased digitalization, e-commerce and servitization. There are two apparent strategic paths. Under circumstances of strong price pressure, there is demand for standardized TPL services offering simplicity, minimalism and functionality based on digitalization, e-commerce and servitization. Alternatively, with market developments responsive to supply chain complexity, digitalization, e-commerce and servitization enable development towards innovation and change. We conclude that these developments do not invalidate existing frameworks for TPL strategies but contribute alternative strategies. We formulate three propositions for each strategic path. To avoid being stuck in the middle, TPLs are encouraged to either develop efficient services through servitized logistics chains and digital solutions or develop advanced solutions to integrate the consumer into the logistics network system through competencies to control increased levels of complexity.}

As a result, the implementation of smart and lean concepts has a major impact on logistics performance, whereas information and communication technologies, as well as autonomous logistics systems and vehicles, are not completely implemented and exploited yet.

Four hypotheses - grounded on institutional, resource dependence, and absorptive capacity theories – are tested through generalized structural equation modelling analyses on a longitudinal sample of German firms. The results show a positive impact of vertical collaboration, horizontal collaboration, and collaboration with research institutions on the likelihood to introduce reverse logistics innovation. In contrast, collaboration breadth has a negative impact on reverse logistics, an unexpected and surprising result for the innovation management literature. The article offers recommendations to practitioners as to which partners are more likely to increase the odds of introducing reverse logistics innovation and demonstrates that – to such an aim - firms should select a limited number of partners, identifying the ones that suit their needs the most.}

However, how logistics land uses have been reshaped to accommodate the e-tailing demand has not been adequately studied. By examining the trajectory of logistics space development during the last decade in Shenzhen, an e-tailing hub in China, this study reveals a less common trend of logistics space restructuring that has been identified in a series of existing studies. Results from spatial data analysis indicate a more clustered logistics space across the city, in spite of a slight decrease in the total number of facilities. We argue that e-tailing has acted as a catalyst for determining how logistics facilities are designed, redeveloped, relocated, and utilized to match with changing requirements in supply chain management. Development of new multi-story facilities, renovation of obsolete facilities, and reorganization of existing facilities at regional level, are the major types of land-use efforts to fill in the supply-demand gap in logistics space in this rapidly-urbanizing city with shrinking land availability. The findings could help the governments reconsider the interactions between e-tailing, logistics demand, and sustainable land use patterns in policymaking.}

Reverse logistics programs to support end-of-life product management strategies are becoming more prevalent as firms respond to stricter regulations and increasing consumer expectations. Despite a growing body of theoretical literature on this topic, many firms struggle to implement efficient and effective reverse logistics systems. This research identifies common strategic, tactical, and operational considerations needed to design reverse logistics programs, and offers industry examples to show how organizations have excelled in these areas. Through a synthesis of literature and examples, key takeaways are provided across a range of reverse logistics activities. In doing so, this paper illustrates ways in which managers can implement best practices in reverse logistics that not only benefit the environment but also generate societal and stakeholder value, augment and improve customer service and loyalty, and increase market share and revenue capabilities.}

Currently, there are no studies on the establishment of biopharmaceutical distribution centers. Therefore, in this study, it was assumed that the factors needed for the establishment of existing logistics centers and biopharmaceutical logistics centers would differ. In this study, three factors were extracted from a fuzzy AHP analysis – facility, location, and cost. In addition, 11 detailed factors were indicated, and their importance depended on temperature management devices, convenience of transportation, and the establishment of a logistics information system. Thus, facilities are more important in biopharmaceutical logistics centers than general logistics center.}

This paper uses the three-stage Super-SBM model to eliminate environmental factors and random errors, and introduces the Malmquist index model to measure the static difference and dynamic change analysis of the efficiency of low-carbon logistics in Jiangsu Province. The research results reveal that the external environment and random factors have a certain impact on the measurement results. The efficiency of low-carbon logistics of the 13 cities increases steadily in the period 2010–2020, but the efficiency differences between cities gradually become prominent. Meanwhile, dynamic analysis shows that the efficiency of low-carbon logistics in Jiangsu Province is relatively high, but technological progress has not reached the optimal level yet, a huge room still existing for the improvement. The potential for simultaneously promoting the technological efficiency of low-carbon logistics and reducing carbon emissions remain great. The research results are of important reference value for promoting the transformation and upgrading of regional logistics in Jiangsu Province, China, reducing energy consumption, improving the efficiency of low-carbon logistics, and promoting the sustainable development of low-carbon logistics.}

Current modeling methods are mainly developed to face general industrial systems and are in a certain sense difficult to fully meet the need of modeling military industrial logistics system. In this research, we focus on describing and implementing military industrial logistics agent interaction protocol by presenting a new command interaction diagram (CID) oriented paradigm. We not only present the concept and corresponding graphical notation representations of CID for multi-agent interaction process, but also design and develop the CID modeling tool with a function of logic verification, thus realizing the mechanism of automatic transformation from conceptual model of CID to its simulation model. In addition, we provide a case study and perform agent-based military industrial logistics simulation. The simulation demonstration and corresponding validation show that our method can meet actual needs and achieve good results, with more advantages than other traditional modeling methods. This fact proves the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.}

The steel industry is the core of industrial growth, and it has an indispensable role in the development of countries. Steel is a highly recyclable product, meaning that it can be reused infinitely, increasing the significance of its reverse logistics. Although many studies have been conducted in the area of I4.0 and supply chain management, less attention has been devoted to finding and analyzing potential challenges of I4.0 technologies integration in steel reverse logistics activities. Therefore, this study is conducted to identify and analyse the challenges to efficient integration of I4.0 and sustainable steel reverse logistics system. Data collection is conducted with the assistance of qualified experts familiar with the steel supply chain and I4.0 concept. The interrelations of challenges are specified by Interpretive Structural Modeling, and the final ranking of challenges is determined through the Fuzzy Analytical Network Process. After validating the completed questionnaires, the absence of experts in I4.0, lack of clear comprehension of I4.0 concepts, training programs, and governmental policies and support are determined as the most critical challenges. Finally, the results and discussion, which can help practitioners in the efficient adoption of I4.0 to have a sustainable reverse logistics system, are presented.}

The data at the annual level are collected in the period between 1971 and 2016. The methodology employs the panel data econometrics (panel VAR model). The economic growth (GDP) is found to respond positively to the both, logistics sector (AIR) and government consumption (CON) in the bivariate panel VAR models. The Granger causality test reports a bidirectional link between GDP and AIR and unidirectional causal link running from CON to GDP. A trivariate panel VAR model provides the supportive evidence to the positive logistics sector-government consumption-growth nexus. With regards to the causal relationship, Granger causality test implies a bidirectional causal relationship between all variables of interest suggesting that economic growth can be the consequence of the logistics sector development and government consumption but can also stimulate these two sectors. Even more appealing is the fact that logistics sector is approximated using the air freight implying the tendency of G7 countries to use faster and more efficient matter of transport. Thus, the most important policy implication advocates the need for stimulating the development of logistics sector especially the one based on renewable energy in the seven largest advanced economies since it tends to significantly contribute the economic development.}

Through a series of case studies, we examine ways in which enchantment can occur in digitally mediated shopping environments.

abstract = {Tricity is a specific area in Poland because of the geographical location, landscape, access to the sea, access to a few container terminals and being an agglomeration. That is why both for inhabitants and local businesses city logistics issues are particularly important. The need for more sustainable transportation and integrative planning processes in cities, has been widely developed since 2013 when Urban Mobility Package set up a concept for SUMP (Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans) Within this idea, EU provides financial support for urban mobility projects. So various city logistics’ solutions are implemented but with a different level of success. City logistics measures have in fact their weaknesses and strengths. It is rather challenging to find an optimal solution because it is difficult to take into account the complexity and diversity of urban logistics while keeping all sides engaged. City logistics seems to be a quite difficult issue, mostly because it contains several levels of complexity. Not only it refers to the diversity of the goods transported and heterogeneity of the transportation means, but also involves multiple stakeholders. The most important are authorities, transportation operator, retailers and residents. These stakeholders most often represent different aims and priorities. While local authorities are interested in reducing pollution, congestion or noise, transportation operators and retailers are mainly focused on keeping costs under control while maintaining service levels. In the study, in-depth interviews technique with various stakeholders of city logistics was used. The interview was based on a questionnaire consisting of open and closed questions. One scale question assessed the importance of a given dimension of sustainable urban logistics for the particular stakeholder. This approach made it possible to identify the priorities of individual stakeholder groups. The respondents were a few individual stakeholders for each group identified within the literature review. To address the aim of the study, to analyse gathered data, both qualitative and quantitative methods were implemented. Among the qualitative methods, the Delphi method, text analysis and text mining techniques were used to identify the main characteristics of stakeholders opinions. Then, to draw the detailed results for each group, the Kruskal-Wallis test was held, equivalent to ANOVA, but not requiring normal distribution of variables, impossible to achieve at small sizes of stakeholder groups samples. The Kruskal-Wallis test allowed identifying similarities and differences between the priorities of the studied groups in light of the research problem being examined.}

The article also discusses the sources of investment projects of energy service companies and what specific services are provided by energy service companies. Schemes of logistic chains have been built, the links of which are the customer, energy service company, bank / investor, resource provider, consumer / customer. We propose to improve the model of the logistics chain. The traditional logistics chain is a linear-ordered set of legal entities and individuals that perform logistics functions and operations to conduct material and information flows from the supplier to the consumer. That is, we understand that the links of a simple logistics chain follow each other, thus the links of the chain can contact and perform any actions only in such a sequence. Due to the approach of the traditional logistics chain, problems arise, since the information may reach in a distorted state, or it may not reach at all. We suggest logistics approach to energy service management based on the principles of digital approaches which could be developed from the famous research papers of A. Borovkov. This model is interesting because the analytical center acts as the core in this chain, which translates the information received for everyone. Conclusions are drawn on the relationship between energy conservation, quality and investment. Attention is paid to finding a new approach to energy service from the concept of digital core in logistics network.}

The findings point out that the surveyed companies have carried out several initiatives, such as energy efficiency, costumer recognition and CO2 emissions reduction. In addition, most of sustainable initiatives are intra-organizational, when compared to inter-organizational ones. The majority of surveyed LSPs had plans to implement sustainable programs involving more intra-organizational actions. However, actions towards customer collaboration were rarely mentioned. The main difficulties related to the implementation of sustainable initiatives are: high cost, compliance with legislation when required, difficulty in involving customers in sustainable projects and management of outlying branches due to extensive territory.}

Thus, this paper aims to identify, classify and rank the logistics-related food loss drivers, having more influence on the amount of food loss in the fruit and vegetable supply chain, with the help of a mixed-method approach. First, a literature review was conducted to identify potential logistics-related food loss drivers. A total of 49 articles were analyzed. Second, 21 semi-structured interviews were conducted with industry experts to finalize the drivers. Third, the analytical hierarchy process was employed to rank the drivers having more influence on the amount of food loss. Five main drivers and nineteen sub-drivers were identified at the end of the literature review and interview process. Categorization of main drivers is based on the logistics activities. According to results, warehousing-related drivers and transportation-related drivers are the two most influential drivers on the amount of food loss, while lack of coordination and improper packaging material are the two most influential sub-drivers. Following the ranking of drivers and sub-drivers, mitigation strategies to diminish food loss are also discussed. The findings of this study are intended to guide fruit and vegetable supply chain actors in tackling food loss.}

Yet, much of the research in this space has operated under the assumption that the methods, approaches, and tactics are equally applicable to both mission critical, and traditional logistics systems. Is this necessarily so? Most literature addresses functional issues such as inventory or process management but does not provide an understanding of the drivers of fulfillment performance in mission critical systems. This is a critical gap in the literature. Partnering with the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) and the United States Navy, we studied a mission critical logistics system in order to understand the drivers of these logistics systems and their performance. We utilize a unique dataset consisting of inventory fulfillment and ordering, as well as part criticality and location. Overall the results indicate that inventory management is a much more dynamic process in mission critical logistics systems, whereby flexibility is crucial, and designation of part categories and essentiality can be the determining factor for whether or not the mission fails.}

Besides, both platforms and third-party logistics providers offer online logistics services, which affect consumer product purchase behavior. In this context, traditional offline firms face the challenges of whether to enter e-commerce platforms and which online logistics service to adopt. To address channel and logistics service selection decisions-making issues of these offline firms, our paper considers a market consisting of an offline firm, an e-commerce platform and a third-party logistics service provider, then develops three theoretical models, i.e., not entering the platform (Model NE), entering the platform and adopting the platform logistics (Model YP), entering the platform and adopting the third-party logistics (Model YT). The results imply that, the firm’s optimal channel and logistics service selection strategies are comprehensively affected by the annual service fee and the logistics cost time-sensitivity coefficient. Note that, the logistics cost time-sensitivity coefficient in this paper is equal to the logistics cost regarding delivery time multiplied by the delivery time, that is, shorter delivery time will bring more logistics cost. Moreover, the rise of labor costs, the outbreak of epidemics and natural disasters, etc., will lead to the increase of the logistics cost time-sensitivity coefficient. Specifically, if the annual service fee is relatively high, the firm should not enter the platform; otherwise, in the case of a relatively low (high) logistics cost time-sensitivity coefficient, the firm should enter the platform and adopt the logistics service of the platform (the third-party). From the perspective of consumers (maybe consider corporate social responsibility), the firm should enter the platform. In the extension, when considering consumer return behavior, we find that, as consumer’s online satisfaction increases, the firm shouldn’t necessarily enter the platform.}

In tandem with this, the practice of logistics service sharing has emerged. Logistics services can be provided by a third-party firm or by an online platform under a reselling mode or a marketplace mode. In this study, we considered a setting in which an online platform and a manufacturer sell substitutable products in the online market to investigate how competition intensity and demand sensitivity to the logistics service affect the firms’ decisions and profits. By comparing equilibrium solutions, we found that the level of logistics service provided by the online platform is always higher. We also found that the online platform is always willing to share its logistics services with manufacturers under the marketplace mode. Further, in the reselling mode, using the online platform’s logistics service is the preferred choice for the manufacturer. In the marketplace mode, a higher logistics service level and more room for pricing are two forces that steer the manufacturer’s logistics service choice. Interestingly, as the proportional fee increases, the manufacturer is more inclined to use the online platform’s service.}

Diverse restrictive policies have been enforced to prevent the novel Coronavirus from spreading. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the express logistics companies transport essential goods among different regions in China, supporting people's normal lives. This study explores the dynamic impacts of COVID-19 epidemic on the intra-provincial and inter-provincial express parcel flows based on the statistical and econometric analysis considering the individual-specific effects of each province. The key results obtained from the unique long-run panel data analysis are: (1) the temporal fluctuation of inter-provincial express logistics flows affected by the epidemic is stronger than that of intra-provincial flows, both of which also show significant spatial heterogeneity; (2) the process of China's fighting against the COVID-19 pandemic is divided into four stages according to the severity of pandemic and implications of restrictive policies, which have moderating effects for the impacts on the express logistics; (3) the dynamic effects of the pandemic on the express logistics are obviously heterogeneous in different stages, confirming the effectiveness of restrictive and support policies; (4) the delayed effects of COVID-19 epidemic on the regional express logistics vary with different setting of time lags. In the short term, the typical restrictive policies and Chinese Spring Festival holidays have significant negative effects on the express logistics. In the long term, the resumption of work and production stimulate the demands of express logistics, presenting significant positive effects in post-epidemic era. This study can provide the policy implications for the logistics planning and management under the public health intervention.}

First, the most relevant standards and methods are addressed and explained. Based on ISO IWA 16, they are then compared and combined into a single overview. A case study of the introduction of CarbonCare (emission calculator) and its global transport customers were taken into account to incorporate practical guidelines for a blueprint. Finally, the blueprint is discussed with experts from all modes of transport, culminating in recommendations not only for transport operation but also for harmonizing warehousing, cooling and transshipment - incorporating simplicity, accuracy, flexibility and feasibility.}

The existence of intermediate logistics facilities demonstrates that the metropolitan logistics landscape is more complex than a simple dual structure suggests. Our analyses highlight the mechanisms of the logistics real estate market, the role of public policy, and issues related to the development of metropolitan areas.}

A theoretical model is proposed by integrating the factors of habit and attitude into the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT). A total of 450 valid questionnaires are collected, and the data are analysed using structural equation modelling. The results suggest that (1) rational factors (i.e. performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions and attitude) and irrational factor (habit) collectively determine consumers' usage of logistics technologies; and (2) the key driving factors of consumers' usage behaviour of three logistics technologies do vary. The findings enrich the theoretical research on last-mile logistics and provide managerial implications for retail and logistics service providers.}

abstract = {Disruption risks and quantity discounts have not been explicitly studied in traditional winner determination problems. This paper investigates an innovative winner determination problem with accidental disruptions and quantity discounts for a fourth party logistics provider in a logistics service procurement auction. An effective hybrid strategy that integrates a fortification policy with an outside option policy is developed to mitigate possible disruptions. Integrating the hybrid strategy with a piecewise-linear discount function, a stochastic nonlinear winner determination model is constructed. Utilizing a linearization technique, such a nonlinear winner determination model can be reformulated as a mixed integer linear program. To obtain nearly optimal solutions, a scenario-based approximation method is developed, including a reduced scenario technique and a dual decomposition Lagrangian relaxation technique. Numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed model and method. When the discount parameter decreases or the disruption probability increases, the fortification policy becomes more important for the logistics system. An interesting result indicates that both the auctioneer and bidders may benefit from considering the discount policy. Managerial implications are drawn for fourth party logistics providers to run a reliable logistics system in a cost-effective way.}

This paper presents an efficient Logistics Management Framework Using Deep Learning (eLMF-DL) to implement the computer vision-assisted Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) in the logistic management sector. With a hybrid CNN-LSTM network, eLMF-DL implements a single-stage or one-step convergence optimum decision-support design model that intelligently combines production maximization and demand forecasting. The architecture with the integration of convolutional neural network and long short-term memory network models the machine dynamics and relationships in assorted diverse logistics services demand. To determine uncertainties through dynamic delivery and optimal decisions on allocating logistical service power, the eLMF-DL results in the highest performance.}

After a literature review, a user-centered approach supported by interviews with key stakeholders was followed to define the concept, followed by solution modelling using the Unified Modeling Language (UML) notation. Thus, the high-level requirements will be presented based on a use-cases diagram and the data model based on a class diagram. Also, the automatic order check-in and check-out process on the bus is designed, using Industry 4.0 and IoT principles. This process is relevant since it speeds up the handling of orders in transshipments, reduces the possibility of human error, while at the same time enhancing control and promoting real-time knowledge of the delivery status of orders. The results of this study expand the knowledge in an area with scarce literature. In practical terms this study presents valuable contributions, since it specifies a solution for urban logistics that can have environmental and social impact in the context of urban areas.}

GHG emissions from logistics activities are predicted to increase significantly by 2050, so they need to be controlled with the right logistics planning strategy. This study aims to apply the green logistics concept in crude oil transportation that considers multiple depots and heterogeneous fleets by using multi-objective optimization (MOO). This study investigates a case study of crude oil logistics to a refinery unit in 6 scenarios with single-objective optimization (SOO) and MOO cases. Each of the scenarios differs in objective functions and ship’s fuel type (i.e. diesel and LNG). Optimization is performed to select the best option of crude oil supply sources and the type of ships that carry crude oil to the refinery unit in each scenario. The results show that in MOO scenarios, the use of LNG fueled ships and optimized routes can reduce CO2 emissions and logistic costs by 27.8% and 50.6% compared to average current crude oil logistic cases. MOO scenarios with LNG ships also performed better compared to the diesel-fueled option, it can reduce CO2 emissions by 18.5% without a significant increase in total logistic cost. Furthermore, the SOO and MOO comparison shows the effect of applying green logistics by using MOO, resulting in less GHG emissions with unnoticeable change in cost.}

It is found that this network exhibits a disassortative configuration and its link weight (respectively, node strength) follows a Weibull (an exponential) distribution. We also find that the hierarchical structure of the city logistics network is highly consistent with the strategic layout of constructing modern comprehensive transportation system plan in China’s “Thirteenth Five-Year Plan”. Furthermore, it is observed that the cities with high Gross Domestic Product (GDP) have high centrality in the city logistics network and the logistics flows between two cities are proportional to the product of their GDPs. Our results not only uncover the topological and hierarchical structure of the city logistics network in China, but also provide an understanding of the structural shaping force on the growth of city logistics network.}

abstract = {Mining and mineral resources help provide the requirements of everyday life by contributing to essential products and services. In the era of fourth industrial revolution, the trend in logistics is toward a smart logistics system. Therefore, it becomes essential to understand how Industry 4.0 resources influence smart logistics, i.e., instrumented logistics, interconnected logistics, and intelligent logistics. This study investigates how Industry 4.0 resources impact smart logistics and further influence dynamic remanufacturing and green manufacturing capability and, the final effect on business logistics sustainability. Survey data were collected from 150 respondents using an online survey of South African executives in firms operating mines, quarries, and processing plants. Partial Least Squares based structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was used to test the hypotheses. The findings indicate that Industry 4.0 resources have a strong effect on intelligent logistics compared to its impact on interconnected logistics and instrumented logistics. The impact of intelligent logistics is found to be very high compared to that of interconnected logistics and instrumented logistics on dynamic remanufacturing and green manufacturing capability. Finally, dynamic remanufacturing and green manufacturing capability are found to have a positive influence business logistics sustainability.}

Considering the few studies on WEEE management, specifically on reverse logistics systems in Brazil, this study's main objective consists in assessing the environmental benefits and burdens resulting from a reverse logistics system that considers a variety of WEEE, by means of life cycle assessment (LCA). The study provides robust information and data that may assist in decision-making regarding reverse logistics processes and operations, in addition to environmental benefits as to WEEE component material recovery. Moreover, the LCA model and material flow scheme presented can be replicated by other dismantling companies, with similar processes, to estimate the burdens and benefits from recycling. The results indicate that the benefits of reverse logistics outweigh its impacts, remarkably due to the saving of metals and mineral resources resulting mainly from recycling printed circuit boards, and to the reduction of the potential environmental impact in human toxicity categories.}

These countries could be used as a benchmark for improving the performance of competing countries, specifically emerging economies. The aim of this study is to develop a methodological framework for recommending logistics policies to improve the LPI score of specific countries. The study implements both qualitative and quantitative methods for developing the strategic recommendations in an uncertain business environment. The sources of the required data include logistics magazines, scientific articles, newspapers, World Bank investment reports, news and Ministry of Transport publications of the countries, as well as expert opinions. The framework consists of two main steps; (i) analyzing countries’ logistics strategies and their impacts on LPI scores and (ii) providing policy recommendations for improving the LPI score of specific countries under consideration. We implemented the developed framework to provide strategic recommendations for Turkey. The developed framework is a strategic tool which can be used by countries to benchmark and implement relevant logistics policies, thus sustaining and improving their LPI scores and worldwide trade performances.}

This has made field workers to be on their toes to understand and implement all the changes. The logistics like referral forms, GeneXpert/CBNAAT cartridges, slides etc., required for the program need to be calculated and used as per the changes. Shortages in the procurement or indenting will result in hampering the smooth functioning of the program. Accordingly, we calculated the logistics required for the patients estimated to occur in an area depending on the previous year's patient load. The breakup of the patients was adopted from the available references given. Also, the 2019 data of the load of different type of patients in India and the world were also taken. Total logistics were calculated for two hundred patients. Based on the calculations, a generic formula was derived. When the total number of patients in the previous year/quarter/or any period is N, then below is the formula which can estimate the required logistics for the next similar period.}

The space station overall operation planning consists of the on-orbit activity allocation and its supporting logistics design. A two-level optimization approach is proposed to solve this complicated problem hierarchically by using a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. The first-level problem is to optimize the overall allocation scheme of on-orbit activities to achieve the activity distribution equilibrium on logistics demand, resource requirement, and activity characteristics. The second-level problem is to optimize the launch time and loading scheme of visiting vehicles under multiple constraints to meet the on-board supply demand, and a pretreatment strategy is proposed based on the space-station logistics domain knowledge to resolve constraints a priori. Numerical results indicate that the proposed formulation for space-station overall operation planning is effective, and the proposed pretreatment approach can reduce the difficulty of satisfying multiple constraints in optimization.}

abstract = {Digital technologies integrated into port logistics are becoming increasingly decisive among port cities around the world. This growing importance is due to the need for policymakers, urban managers, port authorities, local administrators, shipping companies, couriers, and so on to develop increasingly digitalized and sustainable logistic processes. Therefore, in a global context characterized by intense datafication and globalization of trade, the data-based approach has become a necessary modus operandi to promote smart and sustainable logistics development. This forward-looking model of port logistics uses technologies such as IoT, sensors, cloud computing platforms, Big Data analytics, Artificial Intelligence (AI), GPS tracking systems, radars, drones, real-time monitoring stations, smart grids, and so on in order to collect, process, monitor and analyse data and information concerning the economic, environmental, social and technological sphere of port cities. In this sense, mobile and fixed platforms help logistics operators to optimize the management of flows (e.g., water, waste, emissions, raw materials, people, monetary investments, etc.) in an efficient and digitized manner. The study proposes a systematic literature review of the most recurring themes concerning smart and sustainable logistics initiatives within port cities in order to develop a multidimensional framework capable of holistically integrating the prevailing enabling factors (Ecosystem, Internal Organization, Data and Security, Policy and Regulation, Finance and Funding, and Digital and Technology), domains (Mobility, Environment, Economy, Telecommunications, Safety and Security, Government, and Community) and goals (Sustainable Development and Digitalization) that characterize smart and sustainable logistical development. To this end, the best practices of several pioneering port cities such as Rotterdam, Hamburg, Singapore, Los Angeles, Amsterdam, etc. implemented in partnerships with technology companies such as Cisco, IBM, Huawei and SAP were also analysed. Therefore, the results of this research show that smart and sustainable logistics initiatives in port cities: (a) have the potential to enhance the efficiency of the economic, environmental, social and technological flows; (b) increase the involvement and awareness of stakeholders such as couriers, shippers, shipping companies, citizens, port authorities, municipalities, security officers, gate and terminal personnel, and so on; and (c) provide a detailed overview of the enabling factors, domains and goals that must be activated by port cities to foster a smart and sustainable logistic transition.}

Furthermore, the differences among various facility types, with respect to the key locational characteristics that attract logistics facility developments, are still not clear. This research attempts to fill the research gap by analyzing the location choices for logistics facility development. Using the data from the Paris Region, we characterize the locations and activities of logistics facilities and estimate a logistics facility location choice model for each activity category. The analysis reveals the key locational characteristics that influence logistics facility locations, such as zoning regulations, wholesale job accessibility, population density, and the accessibility to autoroute (controlled-access highway), as well as the heterogeneity in the effects of these characteristics by activity category. Zoning and traditional clusters play a significant role for the locations of newly developed logistics facilities, which underlines the importance of public policies for logistics land use in the Paris region. The effect of the accessibility to population is identified for the group of facilities which serve for retail shops and end-consumers only under the assumption that alternative locations are limited to specialized economic activity/logistics zones, indicating that population accessibility is a secondary factor to the designation as the specialized zone. Zoning changes to/from economic activity/logistics zones may cause significant impacts on the spatial distribution of logistics facilities, and thus, the distribution of goods vehicle traffic flow.}

From the perspective of new economic geography, the positive environmental externality of logistics agglomeration should outstrip its negative externality as the result of technological spillover. However, significant impacts of technological progress on the environment have not been identified in the logistics agglomeration sub-regions of many developing countries currently grappling with various environmental problems. This paper applies spatial econometrics and extended STIRPAT model to explore the roles the logistics agglomeration (LA) and technological progress (T) play in air pollution (I) using panel data from sub-regions of Chongqing in China between 2009 and 2019. The main conclusions are as follows. (1) In a global context, logistics agglomeration is a meaningful way to reduce air pollution under the interaction effect of technological progress. (2) In a sub-regional context: first, the suppressive effect of logistics agglomeration on air pollution gradually rebounds with the increase in agglomeration degree; secondly, the rebound effect of technological innovation is also evident in air pollution, and the rebound area gradually spreads from the metropolitan area to the peripheral sub-regions; finally, the interaction effect of logistics agglomeration and technological progress has a noteworthy suppression effect on air pollution, especially after the occurrence of the rebound effect of the logistics agglomeration and technological progress. In this regard, local governments should suppress the negative externalities of agglomeration with the interaction effects of technological progress while strengthening logistics agglomeration.}

Incoterms clauses are commercial terms that clearly determine sellers' logistics commitments. They are also the “channels” that connect trade and logistics. The research explores the relationship between the international TL performance indicators and the Incoterms score (IS) which represents the extent of sellers' logistics commitments in bilateral trade at a national level. As per empirical results, the logistics performance indexes (LPIs) show the significant impact of a country's logistics performance on the IS. The country's economic development is also correlated with the IS and the domestic logistics performance indicators. This correlation is not seen with regards to the global competitiveness of transport infrastructure. Additionally, while the geographic distance does not have a direct correlation, it impacts buyers' or sellers' obligations, when considered along with the LPIs in the gravity model. According to the empirical results, a conceptual framework for the usage of applied Incoterms clauses for logistics performance assessment and benchmarking is proposed. The policymakers may use ISs as additional indicators when assessing a country's logistics performances as well as to estimate the possibilities of expanding the TL market for promoting international trade flows. Such assessment enables both national and international benchmarking to rely on the national database. The usage of Incoterms clauses for monitoring, assessing, and benchmarking a country's TL performance must be considered more profoundly by the policymakers in the future.}

However, who should take charge of logistics, especially when there is increasing consumption of plastic containers, utensils, and other single-use items? In practice, either platform logistics or restaurant's self-logistics is available. For the former, customers pay for food and logistics services separately, while for the latter, “food & logistics” is sold in a bundle. Using game-theoretical approach, we consider a fast-food restaurant selling food in both online and physical stores, which cooperates with an online food-delivery platform under commission contract, and opts to use the platform logistics or self-logistics to deliver online orders. Interestingly, we find that the online “food & logistics” price under two logistics strategies exhibit opposite relationships with respect to the commission rate, and the restaurant's offline food price might first increase and then decrease in the online commission rate. Consequently, the restaurant prefers to use platform logistics when its online market potential is low. We show that the restaurant's preference for platform logistics is non-monotonic in the online market potential. Using the sales quantity-based environmental index (EI) to measure the sustainability performances under the two logistics strategies, we find that the platform logistics strategy is more environment-friendly when the online market potential is high.}

abstract = {Every year about 300 million tons of plastic is produced, resulting in more than five trillion plastic particles currently floating in the oceans five largest convergence zones. The Ocean Cleanup is testing a method to passively collect this floating plastic debris, transport, recycle, process and sell it. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate alternative logistics chains to accommodate ocean plastic waste recycling by connecting transport with data collection and data analytics. The scenarios are based on different geographical destinations, supply chain lengths and types, and offered local development opportunities. A new reverse logistics channel dedicated to the Ocean Cleanup is developed, as existing reverse logistics supply chains are not able to capture the specifics of the plastic waste collection. Performances of the different scenarios are assessed by collecting data (on plastic volumes collected from the Ocean, on usage of plastics as a resource, and on transport cost) and usage of a detailed integrated model which enables a performance comparison of different logistical structures on logistics costs and on plastics production outputs. The cheapest and most disappointing solution would be to do nothing. However, the analysis shows that more complicated logistic structures whereby the collected plastic waste is used to produce glasses, socks, and carpets can lead to sustainable business models for cleaning up the Oceans. If the focus would be only on cost, the best model would be to minimize the transport distance and focus on San Francisco as closest port for the selected gyre to be analyzed.}

In this study, we propose a three-stage optimization model with a two-level hub-and-spoke structure to establish an intra-city metro logistics network. First, we establish an entropy-weighted TOPSIS model to rank the transshipment capacity of metro stations based on four network centrality indicators, and use the results as the basis to classify metro stations into candidate hub and spoke nodes. Second, we establish a maximum-coverage location model that accounts for capacity constraints, and use a greedy randomized adaptive search procedure to identify spoke nodes. Third, with the objective of minimizing the transport distance within the whole network, we solve the hub-and-spoke network planning problem with capacity constraints by using a tabu search algorithm to identify the hub nodes. Finally, we take Shanghai as an empirical case study to demonstrate a suitable layout optimization scheme for Shanghai’s metro logistics network. Through sensitivity analysis, we then analyze the impact of different capacity parameters on the layout of the network.}

Although not much research has been done in the field of governance of construction logistics, several authors have stressed the fragmented nature of the construction industry and the importance of collaboration in urban construction logistics as issues. A literature review was done to identify the barriers in collaboration. Based on these barriers the research objective was to determine which drivers for collaborative governance are needed to improve urban construction logistics. The methods for data collection were semi-structured interviews and a focus group. The collaborative governance model is applied as a strategy to overcome the barriers in collaboration and governance identified. Key findings are both formal and informal barriers hinder the governance of construction logistics. Based on a collaborative governance model we identified four for improving collaborative governance.}

abstract = {National logistics cost can be used as a key indicator to reflect a country's overall logistics performance and monitor their respective logistics policies. However, not all countries have developed this indicator, and some have used differing methodologies. This paper provides an approach for calculating national logistics cost per gross domestic product (NLC/GDP) in the context of Thailand and demonstrates its veracity and validity using an action research methodology with key stakeholders. The approach utilizes easily obtainable macro level data combined with survey data. The calculation method has progressively improved in its accuracy and efficacy to reflect Thailand's logistic context. The proposed approach contributes to the national logistics cost debate and can inform academics, managers, and policy makers not just in Thailand but, in other countries when developing their own NLC/GDP to evaluate their respective logistics development activities.}

abstract = {There are growing social and government pressures that encourage end of life (EOL) electronic products companies to focus on reverse logistics (RL) and recovery options. The complexity of RL elements for EOL electronic products is a challenge in this field. Recently, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) have focused on RL activities. To this aim, third-party reverse logistics partners (3PRLPs) play an important role. This paper simultaneously draws attention to the selection of 3PRLPs and determine how orders are assigned to every 3PRLP using a new framework. There are two phases in this framework. The first phase includes an approach that integrates data envelopment analysis (DEA) with a differential evolution (DE) algorithm to increase the discriminatory power and distinguish the 3PRLPs based on their efficiencies. DEA is considered in this study because it is an effective method to determine the efficiency based on the simultaneous analysis of inputs and outputs. In Phase 2, those efficiency scores are utilized to allocate orders to 3PRLPs using a multi-objective model. Two solution approaches are employed for solving the proposed multi-objective model and to find Pareto-optimal solutions. The application of the models is shown in Canada’s cellphone industry. The results reveal that the efficiency of 3PRLPs may have an effect on both third-party reverse logistics partner selection and the orders allocated to them.}

Since the needs of consumers have increased in recent years, the exacerbation of traffic congestion, noise, and pollution in city centers has emerged. Therefore, logistics companies need to implement strategies to maintain their efficiency and accuracy, while simultaneously supporting green logistics. This paper describes a sustainable approach where logistics companies collaborate, by sharing fleet and resources, in the routing and scheduling operations. To estimate the improvements, in terms of pollution and cost reduction, the case where companies operate independently, is compared to the collaborative case. The data exploited in the research, originated from the daily distribution cases, faced by Third-Party Logistics companies in Greece. These daily cases are addressed by a heuristic algorithm, either individually, for studying the way they operate today, or jointly, for determining the collaborative case's advantages.}

In this study, we develop an optimization model to optimize the logistics for a fleet of drones for timely delivery of medical items (e.g., medicines, test kits, and vaccines) to hard-to-access locations (i.e., rural and suburban areas). We propose a novel timeslot formulation that schedules and sequences a set of trips to serve several demand locations. On each trip, a drone starts from an urban provider, visits one or more charging platforms (if required), serves a clinic in rural or suburban areas, and returns to the corresponding provider. The problem consists of selecting locations for charging stations, assigning clinics to providers, and scheduling and sequencing the trips such that the total completion time to serve all demand points is minimized. To improve the computational efficiency of the solution method, we use a preprocessing procedure to reduce the solution space by eliminating the dominated trips from the pool of trips. A set of numerical experiments is performed on simulated instances and on a case study in Louisville, KY. The results unveil interesting insights into the logistics of the proposed drone delivery system.}

The concept of a Mars orbital logistics node is envisaged to have at least aggregation, refueling, resupply and refurbishing capabilities is defined in this paper. Its elements are analogous to platforms like the International Space Station and Lunar Gateway. The stationing orbit of the logistics node is one of the primary design drivers in determining the associated propellant requirement. We evaluate ΔV requirements across four phases of the mission—interplanetary transfer, capture and departure, deorbit and entry, and launch and orbit transfer. A comprehensive data base of interplanetary trajectories is analyzed. Perturbations due to Mars’ gravity are considered and multiple options for maneuver are considered herein. Three mission scenarios – long stay crewed, short stay crewed and cargo transfer – are evaluated along with three deorbit concepts. A broad range of Low Mars Orbits (LMO) with periods between 0.4 and 0.6 sols and Highly Elliptical Mars Orbits (HEMO) with periods between 2 and 4 sols is found to fall on the trade-off curve of total ΔV and orbital periods across seven synodic periods. Final orbit selection can be made using this data and a desired criteria and mission timeline. For example, HEMO minimizes propellant to access the stationing orbit from interplanetary trajectory whereas LMO minimizes propellant requirement to access the surface from the stationing orbit. HMO is also favorable for short stay and cargo missions.}

Together with discussing the problems, we also look at the trends in solving these problems using machine learning. We look at the recent work done in the particular fields using machine learning (ML) and develop the correlation of the trends of using supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning in solving these problems. This correlation is developed using a table and a diagram showing ML techniques and the trends in the fields of the problems are discussed. COVID-19 has greatly accelerated these trends. This paper serves as a gentle introduction to ML techniques in the field of logistics for researchers who are new to the field.}
