abstract = {Abstract:
A multi-agent system for the steel production is presented. It re-allocates off-spec products to existing alternative orders. The system consists of three main Industry 4.0 components: agents, service-oriented architecture (SOA) and a semantic modelling of the process chain. Using economic principles like virtual marketplaces, the solution of the reallocation is reached by means of auctions, where product agents act as sellers and order agents act as bidders. A virtual price defines the key for the matching process between order and product. To incorporate postprocessing, product agents anticipate their possibly reachable future states with first-principle models. The matching between order and product characteristics is then based on the predicted product future and the order specification. As the post-processing comes at a cost, logistics costs, administrative costs and transformation costs are also considered for constructing the virtual price. The presented system runs as online open-loop prototype at a steel plant of ArcelorMittal and shows promising results for the reallocation task.}

Despite the geographic spread of economic activities over decades and the uneven development of ports, the cores of both systems have long remained in the same metropolitan areas. While co-location does not provide necessary or causal connection, strong a priori grounds can be offered to posit that a necessary relationship exists between the Japanese manufacturing system's geographic expansion and changes in the maritime transport network. A case study of automobile industry's recent development in the peripheral region of Kyushu identifies some drivers of these evolutions at the level of one particular sector. This suggests that, despite the development of high capacity transport infrastructure and manufacturing facilities in the Japanese periphery, the current manufacturing core is not yet threatened.}

abstract = {Background and purpose
This paper describes a student-led co-curricular training program to increase pharmacy student proficiency with medical Spanish terminology. Western University of Health Sciences (WesternU) pharmacy students frequently can interact with Spanish-speaking patients in experiential rotations. Moreover, the clear majority of program graduates remain in California, a state with a high Spanish-speaking population. Developing foundational knowledge of medical Spanish terminology can enhance communication with Spanish-speaking patients, who may have limited English proficiency and experience a lack of language concordance when interacting with the healthcare system. Providing training in medical terminology in another language is important because communication barriers have been associated with adverse medical outcomes, such as poor medication adherence.
Educational activity and setting
The development of the training logistics and materials are described for replication of the process, whether with medical Spanish or other languages. Students in the pharmacy program developed the medical Spanish training that is now a robust co-curricular activity with over 100 students participating in the training each semester. An important aspect of the WesternU co-curricular activity is that students develop materials, create learning activities, and facilitate training.}

abstract = {Background
Due to laboratory logistic issues, our center has traditionally scheduled peripheral blood stem cell harvests based on timing from the start of mobilization. This has proved to be useful in some cases, but also resulted in many fruitless harvests due to poor mobilization. In order to improve the efficiency of collections and compare the effectiveness of peripheral blood CD34+ cells as a predictor with data from other reports, this study analyzed the implementation of this routine.
Methods
Peripheral blood and leukapheresis samples were quantified by flow cytometry and the association between these parameters was assessed.
Results
Sixty-six consecutive leukapheresis samples were collected from 34 patients after the collection of peripheral blood samples for CD34+ quantification. A moderate positive correlation was observed between peripheral blood CD34+ cell count and total CD34+ cell count/kg (r=0.596; p-value<0.001). A multivariable regression model also confirmed this association and allowed the estimation that for every increase in five CD34+ cells/μL in the peripheral blood, a mean increase of 0.38×106CD34+cells/kg could be predicted. Demographic characteristics, baseline comorbidities and mobilization regimen did not influence final CD34+ cell count in this sample.
Conclusions
As observed in other centers, quantification of peripheral blood CD34+ progenitor cells is a strong predictor of effectiveness to guide stem cell harvesting. Due to the results of this study, a modification in the peripheral blood stem cell harvesting logistics was implemented at our center in order to incorporate this routine.}

This complex process is most often approached in a segmented fashion, not looking at all barns at the same time in relation to each other. Linear programming, the basis of most nutritional formulation packages and logistics services, provides a mathematical means for characterizing pig flow that allows a producer to look at the entire flow of pigs in a system at the same time. We describe a teaching model that provides the foundation to characterize pig flow in a commercial production system. The teaching model is built in Microsoft Excel® and incorporates key components of production such as growth rate, mortality, stocking density, seasonality, packer grid pricing, and marketing. The results from this teaching model are sound and provide the foundation for a larger model that is needed for full implementation within a production system, proving this model behaves as expected. The generalizability of the model and its assumptions allows for the inclusion of more barns, a more precise measure of time, and the ability to change the assumptions utilized in this teaching scenario, which are needed for direct application in a production system.}

The model is able to precisely monitor key component concentrations keeping oil properties within admissible ranges. One of the most important decisions is how to manage oil shipments so as to improve logistics efficiency. Results show that the use of slot-based frameworks combined with general precedence variables for sequencing tasks in linking resources yields orders-of-magnitude savings in the computational effort to reduce costs and find optimal solutions.}

In this research, it is assumed that vendor and buyer are coordinated by sharing their status. Further, it is assumed the coordination mechanisms that can align their objectives and coordinate their activities by sharing the information between vendor and buyer. This plays an important role in decision making in order to mitigate the current challenges and to increase the system performance and individual profitability of the supply chain. The coordinated mechanism among the members of supply chain has been proposed to achieve the optimal solution. This study formulates mixed integer linear fractional programming models that maximize the ratio of return on investment.

The purpose of this study was to examine the experience of recurrent surgery for patients with implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD).
Background
Device replacement is typically required every 4–7 years due to battery depletion. Furthermore, recurrent surgery may be related to lead malfunction or pocket infection.
Methods
Ethnographic methods were used for data collection with 23 ICD reimplanted recipients, 12 men and 11 women, 26–85 years of age. Data were analyzed using a with-in case and cross-case method.
Results
Three major themes were identified: Anticipation regarding implantation with three sub-themes of logistics and social considerations, decisions regarding replacement, and financial considerations. Relinquishing control and somatic changes frame perceptions related to the operative and postoperative periods.
Conclusions
The frequency of ICD reimplantation differentiates it from other surgical interventions. Perceptions varied according to past experiences and present day social, financial, and somatic differences. Recipients are resolved to life-long surgery aided by their trust in health care professionals.}

Taking vehicles as an example of heterogeneous assets, we first present an arc-based formulation for the proposed problem and discuss two associated subproblems. We then propose a tabu search based metaheuristic for this problem. Over a wide range of network design instances, we respectively compare our approach with CPLEX with one-hour and ten-hour time limits. Computational results demonstrate that the proposed approach performs very well in terms of solution quality and computing time, especially for large instances.}

This study provides an overview of ongoing efforts and advances as well as environmental and economic aspects of this technology. In pyrolysis, lignocellulosic biomass is converted to biochar or biooil. The potential to reduce life cycle greenhouse gases from pyrolysis depends on the feedstock used, the conversion technology, the size of the pyrolysis unit, and the way co-products are used. Slow pyrolysis may provide greater environmental benefits because it produces more biochar which can be applied to soil to improve its quality and to sequester carbon. However, fast pyrolysis has a better economic return because of the production of higher value products. The profitability of pyrolysis depends on feedstock costs, product yields, the ability to produce higher value products, and production scale. Mobile pyrolysis technologies may be a solution to reduce the feedstock logistics challenges because they allow the production of bioenergy at the sources of feedstock. Technological advances need to be coupled with renewable energy policy to expand pyrolysis renewable energy production. However, any investment in this technology should consider a broader sustainability analysis to mitigate environmental and economic risks.}

To overcome cost and logistics problems of IA, the application of the aptamer BC007 for in vivo neutralization of GPCR-AABs could help. We demonstrate here, that the aptamer neutralized, in vitro, the presently known cardiovascular-pathogenic GPCR-AABs. In spontaneously hypertensive rats, the aptamer demonstrated its GPCR-AAB neutralizing potency in vivo. In the serum of DCM patients, the same GPCR-AAB reduction was achieved when patients were either immunoadsorbed or patient's serum was ex vivo treated with the aptamer. In our view, aptamer BC007 treatment in GPCR-AAB-positive patients would have a comparable benefit as that seen after IA. Not knowing all that interfering with our idea of aptamer-dependent neutralization of GPCR-AABs, the first preliminary steps have been taken for bringing the idea closer to patients.}

Previous works in the literature have proposed effective greedy algorithms or the solution of the NP-Hard LCP variants. This paper incorporates a new constraint into the LCP, motivated by the need to limit the number of partners with whom the collaborative tours must be coordinated.

Therefore, the planning of pipeline operations is a crucial part of logistics management in these industries. A particularly challenging problem is the pipeline scheduling which is concerned with finding the sequences, times, and sizes of batch injections in pipeline systems. This paper specifically studies the underlying core scheduling problem by assuming a simple multi-product pipeline system. It is shown that finding a sequence of batches which minimizes stock holding and setup costs in the long run is an NP-hard scheduling problem, namely a variant of the economic lot scheduling problem (ELSP) with additional constraints. Therefore, a powerful heuristic for the sequence-dependent ELSP is adapted and extended to meet the requirements of the outlined pipeline scheduling problem. The application of the heuristic is illustrated by case studies from chemical and petroleum industry.}

This pricing requirement arises due to both the massive volume of vaccines needed and the logistics necessary to ensure their integrity (i.e. the cold chain). Cost-prohibitive vaccine formulation strategies, especially for newer vaccines, along with the lack of infrastructure in developing nations can further complicate this process. Extensive research is being conducted to develop novel technological platforms that overcome each of these accessibility impediments. This review provides an overview of the humanitarian organizations and technological developments that are dedicated to improving global healthcare by increasing vaccine accessibility.}

We introduce a two-phase event correlation method which first correlates simple events into complex events and then events with supply chain objects. We describe how the proposed model has been implemented in a software framework and we conduct evaluation tests to examine its situation detection capabilities.}

In the paper, a novel approach is introduced that enables the faster introduction of modular assembly cells in the daily production by offering a flexible platform for evaluating the system performance considering dynamic logistics and production environment. The method is aimed at evaluating different modular cell configurations with discrete-event simulation, applying automated model building and centralized simulation model control. Besides, the simulation is linked with the production and capacity planning model of the system in order to implement a cyclic workflow to plan the production and evaluate the system performance in a proactive way, before releasing the plan to the production.

The purpose of this paper is to present the activity of container terminals and examine how the growing turnover of container units has affected the port cities. The interaction between the latter and port terminals has been discussed. The research is based on the terminals located in Polish port cities of Gdynia and Gdańsk, which play a leading role in the development of the economy in the region. The research has shown that maritime networks have an ever-growing influence on ports and port – city relationships. On the one hand, the growth of maritime logistic services has a positive influence on the labor market and transport infrastructure, which is also used by the inhabitants. On the other hand, the increase in container cargo volume has a negative impact on urban areas through a number of negative externalities (congestion, noise, pollutant emissions, etc.). This creates a conflict in which the city has to bear the external effects of the port operations. In this context, solutions incorporating the sustainable development of both port and urban areas are essential.}

The study includes the assessment of potentially available quantities of those waste flows in Europe. Due to the low technology readiness level of this kind of biorefineries, a screening methodology to estimate the investment and manufacturing costs as well as two profitability ratios (the return on investment and the payback time) was adopted. Results show that not all the waste feedstocks have the same potential. The most profitable options are those related to implementing fewer plants, namely concentrating the production and capitalising on economies of scale while being at risk of increasing externalities, e.g. due to logistics of the feedstocks.}

Three different types of temperature memory effect are investigated and the most applicable one, i.e., with good estimation of the actual over-heating temperature, is identified. The detailed implementation procedure for real practice is presented and the strategy to improve the accuracy is discussed. It is shown that in terms of checking the actual over heating temperature, a precision of within ±0.5°C is achievable in both tested NiTi SMAs.}

The specific SB assumptions are: (i) a second-order polynomial is an adequate approximation (a valid metamodel) of the input/output function of the underlying simulation model; (ii) the directions (signs) of the first-order effects are known (so the first-order polynomial approximation is monotonic); (iii) so-called “heredity” applies; i.e., if a specific input has a “small” first-order effect, then this input has “small” second order effects. Moreover, SB assumes Gaussian simulation outputs if the simulation model is stochastic (random). A generalization of SB called “multiresponse SB” (or MSB) uses the same assumptions, but allows multiple types of simulation responses (outputs). In this article, we develop heuristic practical methods for testing whether these assumptions hold, and we evaluate these methods through Monte Carlo experiments and a case study (namely, a Chinese logistics network).}

The task is to choose open facilities, a Steiner tree among them as a core network, and access trees with appropriate cable types on their edges to connect clients to the open facilities in such a way that the sum of the facility opening costs and cable costs for the core and access networks is minimal. Problems of this type arise widely in the planning of access and distribution networks in telecommunications, logistics, or energy networks. In this paper, we introduce and analyze two fundamental versions of these problems. In the Buy-at-Bulk version of the problem, each access cable type has a fixed setup cost and a fixed capacity, whereas in the Deep-Discount problem version, each cable type has unlimited capacity but a traffic-dependent variable cost in addition to its fixed setup cost. We derive the first constant-factor approximation algorithms for these problems, using different algorithmic and analytical techniques.}

Up to now, no commercial vaccines against ASF are available. With the rapid development of international trade and modern logistics and the frequent trade activities with Africa, Europe and neighboring countries, the risk of cross-border transmission of ASF to ASF-free regions is increasing. Therefore, there is an urgent need to establish a convenient and low-cost diagnostic method for rapid and on-site detection of the virus to timely implement the control measures. In this study, a cross-priming amplification in combination with immunochromatographic strip (CPA-strip) was established for rapid detection of ASFV. The CPA-strip assay displayed no cross-reactivity to other swine viruses. The minimum detection limit of this method was 200 copies. Forty-five clinical swine blood samples collected from Uganda were examined by the novel assay, 6 out of 45 samples were tested positive for ASFV. The agreement rate between the CPA-strip assay and the universal probe library-based real-time PCR was 97.8% (44/45). In addition, a total of 100 tissue samples and 57 blood samples from Chinese swine herds were tested to be negative. We concluded that the established CPA-strip method is suitable for on-site detection of ASFV.}

However, the bioenergy industry faces a well-established “chicken and egg” conundrum where biorefineries cannot be built until adequate farmers' participation in cellulosic biomass production is ensured; on the other hand, farmers will not commit to growing cellulosic biomass until a market is established. We assume that individual farmers in a future biofuel market are boundedly rational, and will endure the risk of growing switchgrass if they are likely to receive a better payoff in the future. After the number of switchgrass farmers reaches a certain threshold, sufficient biomass can be procured to build an economically viable biorefinery. If a biorefinery is built in a region, the reductions of logistics costs and economies of scale lead to the realization of a public good, and all farmers can be benefited from it; otherwise, the efforts of early switchgrass adopters could be unsuccessful. In this paper, an appropriate biorefinery capacity and the corresponding incentives provided to the farmers are determined by balancing the impact and the risk of the public good. Our incentive model is more efficient than a program that incentivizes all switchgrass growers equally.}

However, knowledge about distribution patterns of critical and endangered species and habitats at different spatial scales is needed for effective marine management strategies. To gain information of sessile community distribution on broader spatial scales (>1 km), visual imaging was employed for the first time on a reef complex in the south-western Baltic Sea. Analysis of 3000 images along 6 transects (in total 18 km long) from 10 to 40 m depth revealed high natural variation in reef physical structure, with well-defined changes in sessile species richness, cover and composition. Overall 14 morphological groups could be distinguished by imaging and 4 distinct community groups associated with specific habitat requirements were identified. Depth remained the best descriptor. However, data indicate that light intensity, concentration of organic carbon and suspended particulate matter have an effect on reef community distribution. Compared to fully marine conditions, the study revealed a unique zonation pattern in the circalittoral zone of the Fehmarnbelt brackish transition area, with an unexpected reef habitat in the trench. We conclude that towed camera platform imagery might help to close the information gap regarding rocky reefs in the temperate subtidal. It provides a valuable tool to assess the main distribution patterns of sessile assemblages on rough terrain, potentially applicable for management and conservation planning.}

To ensure data are robust and comparable it is important to consider methodological factors which may affect results. One significant question which has not been directly addressed in previous studies is how sample size (expressed here as number of Sphagnum stems) affects data quality. In three contrasting locations in a Russian peatland we extracted samples of differing size, analysed testate amoebae and calculated a number of widely-used indices: species richness, Simpson diversity, compositional dissimilarity from the largest sample and transfer function predictions of water table depth. We found that there was a trend for larger samples to contain more species across the range of commonly-used sample sizes in ecological studies. Smaller samples sometimes failed to produce counts of testate amoebae often considered minimally adequate. It seems likely that analyses based on samples of different sizes may not produce consistent data. Decisions about sample size need to reflect trade-offs between logistics, data quality, spatial resolution and the disturbance involved in sample extraction. For most common ecological applications we suggest that samples of more than eight Sphagnum stems are likely to be desirable.}

One of the major changes concerns the rapid growth of the e-commerce utilization, which brings changes to the transportation system – e.g., courier, express and parcel service providers (CEP) sector with it. Thus, the CEP sector is the most increasing and dominant logistics sector worldwide. Especially in agglomerations, a high growth potential is expected for the future. It is mostly driven by the demand of private households and retail in urban agglomerations. Considering the importance of CEP, the knowledge about CEP – from a transport modeller's view – is still scarce. There are several studies with focus on consumer's e-commerce behaviour or the supply side. However, – as far as the authors are aware of – there are no extensive studies examining both, transport demand and supply. This, however, is crucial for a better understanding and modelling of CEP actors. We present our first results and a theoretical and empirical based approach to characterise not only the supply side of CEP service providers, but also the demand side of private households, and businesses regarding e-commerce as a driver for the development of freight demand.}

We focus on the fundamental function of this business that aims to find available trucks and to define their feasible routes for transporting requested customer loads. The main contribution of this paper is on formulating our scheduling problem as a special type of vehicle routing with pickup and delivery problem. We propose a new set partitioning model of our specific problem. Vehicle routes are defined on the graph of cities, rather than on the graph of customer orders, as typically proposed by set partitioning formulations. This approach is particularly useful when a large number of customer orders sharing a significantly lower number of pickup and delivery points must be scheduled. Our achievement is the declarative representation and solution of the model using ECLiPSe state-of-the-art constraint logic programming system.}

We propose the utilization of resource sharing for manufacturing companies as a possible solution in analogy to shared loads in transport logistics. In this context, we refer to production machines as shared resources. Each cooperating company allows others to access its manufacturing resources according to a cooperation agreement. This concept empowers companies to deal with the disturbing events by distributing orders to cooperation partners instead of maintaining safety capacities or redundant systems. In this paper we discuss the opportunities and impediments of shared resources in the area of production enterprises. We further provide an outlined concept for its implementation into practice with respect to technological innovations on the one hand and practical requirements on the other hand.

abstract = {Background
Coronary artery bypass grafting surgery (CABG) is a common treatment for coronary artery disease. The patient’s commitment to modify risk factors is necessary to achieve the desired after surgery outcomes. The current study aimed at determining illness perception of patients after CABG, its relation to smoking cessation, and detecting other predictors of smoking cessation.
Methods
The samples of the current cross sectional study were selected from a greater study that was done on patients’ adherence determining for 6 months after CABG surgery. Data collection was performed using a telephone questionnaire with 3 sections: personal and social information, smoking cessation, and illness perception. Data analysis was performed via descriptive statistics, independent t test, and multiple logistic regression analysis through SPSS version 16.
Results
The findings showed that 26.6% of the patients had not stopped smoking for 6 months after CABG, and the mean score of illness perception was 83.28 ± 6.11. The relationship between adherence to smoking cessation and illness perception was not significant. Regression logistics via backward selection to detect factors related to smoking cessation adherence after CABG showed only a lack of hypertension history could predict adherence to smoking cessation (OR = 0.199, P = 0.03).
Conclusions
Based on the results, about one-third of the subjects smoked cigarettes after CABG; therefore, it is critical to plan rehabilitation programs regarding smoking cessation after this surgery.}

In this paper, the implementation and evaluation of a policy-driven large system-initiated reform is described. Over 250 caseworkers and supervisors were trained and supported to implement two evidence-based parent focused interventions in five private agencies serving over 2,000 children and families. At the request of child welfare system leaders, a third intervention was developed and implemented to train the social work workforce to use evidence-based principles in everyday interactions with caregivers (including foster, relative, adoptive, and biological parents). In this paper, we describe the policy context and the targeted outcomes of the reform. We discuss the theory of the interventions and the logistics of how they were linked to create consistency and synergy. Training and ongoing consultation strategies used are described as are some of the barriers and opportunities that arose during the implementation. The strategy for creating a path to sustainability is also discussed. The reform effort was evaluated using both qualitative and quantitative methods; the evaluation design, research questions and preliminary results are provided.}

In real-time workflows, such as in medical processes and emergency situations, and also in logistics, finance and in other business processes with deadlines some violations are unavoidable. Here we introduce the notion of controlled violations as the ability to monitor a running process and develop an approach based on constraint satisfaction to determine the best schedule for its completion in a way so as to minimize the total penalty from the violations. The violations are evaluated in terms of metrics like number of violations, delay in process completion, and penalty of weighted violations. We also relate our work to the concept of controllability in literature and show how it can be checked using our method. Finally, we analyze the properties of our approach and also offer a proposal for implementation.}

In fact, while the use of multi-activity models is increasing in railway efficiency research, previous studies fail short to assess their drivers at each operational stage. Here, we develop a novel super-efficiency Multi-activity Network DEA (MNDEA) model - based on directional distance functions (DDFs) and capable of handling undesirable outputs - to assess how different contextual variables impact railway efficiency levels in Asia. Two case studies are provided: one focused on six different countries, taken in aggregate (Japan, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Myanmar, and Indonesia). The other, on major state-owned Chinese railways. Differently from previous research, Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale and Shape (GAMLSS) are used for the first time to regress super-efficiency scores on the contextual variable set. Findings reveal that the Asian railways are strongly marked by heterogeneity, the Chinese railways need to improve passenger-operation efficiency, while the other countries need to increase the cargo-operation efficiency. It also sheds lights on the design of policies for efficiency improvement in several different areas for the Asian railway system.}

abstract = {Using wood biomass for bioenergy production in mountain urban settlements can represent a win–win strategy when it combines a continuous energy provision to households with a sustainable management of local forests, also boosting rural development and stakeholders’ cooperation. In this study, we implemented a multi-method environmental accounting framework aimed at investigating environmental costs and impacts of a bioenergy value chain located in Sarentino Valley (North Italy). This assessment framework encompasses material, energy, and emergy demands as well as main emissions generated at each step of the chain: (1) forestry, (2) logistics, and (3) conversion. The resulting global to local ratios of abiotic material calculated for forestry, logistics, and conversion subsystems show that the global (direct and indirect) consumption of abiotic matter was respectively 3.6, 3.2, and 7.6 times higher than the direct material demand. The Energy Return on Energy Investment (EROI) of wood biomass and wood chips production (37.1 and 22.4) shows a high energy performance of these processes, while the EROI of heat generation (11.35) reflects a higher support of human-driven inputs. The emergy renewable fraction, ranging from 77% to 37% across the value chain, shows a high use of local renewable resources in the bioenergy value chain. The total CO2 emissions of the bioenergy value chain (4088tCO2yr−1) represent only 7.1% of the CO2 sequestration potential of the Sarentino Valley forest ecosystem, highlighting the capability of the local forests to offset the CO2 emissions released by the value chain. The scenario analysis indicates that using both local sawmill residues and local forest wood chips to power the heating plant could further lower the environmental burden of the bioenergy chain, maximizing local and renewable resources use while reducing waste disposal. The multi-method environmental accounting framework provided a large set of performance and sustainability indicators useful for both local managers and policy makers in charge of ensuring a sustainable management of local forests and energy security of urban settlements.}

Among them, the INTER-IoT project is aiming at the design and implementation of, and experimentation with, an open cross-layer framework and associated methodology to provide voluntary interoperability among heterogeneous IoT platforms. While the project considers interoperability across all layers of the software stack, we are particularly interested in answering the question: how ontologies and semantic data processing can be harnessed to facilitate interoperability across the IoT landscape. Henceforth, we have engaged in a “fact finding mission” to establish what is currently at our disposal when semantic interoperability is concerned. Since the INTER-IoT project is initially driven by two use cases originating from (i) (e/m)Health and (ii) transportation and logistics, these two application domains were used to provide context for our search. The paper summarizes our findings and provides foundation for developing methods and tools for supporting semantic interoperability in the INTER-IoT project (and beyond).}

abstract = {The opinions emphasizing the need of so called reverse distribution and reverse logistics appeared in academic literature on marketing already in the 1970s. They dealt with a systematic move of waste generated in the distribution channel for the purpose of its transformation to usable materials. Changes in the material flows in distribution channels therefore represent both a challenge and an opportunity for managers in association with a change in the concept of rational marketing management. The motivation of customers is of special importance in such an approach, as they need to be sufficiently motivated in order to understand their role of “producers”, and, accordingly, to behave actively, as customers are the driving force in reverse distribution channels. The implementation methods associated with the reverse distribution concept include the activities of retailers, or other members of the distribution channel, for instance the take-back of recyclable materials. Therefore, the perception and assessment of preparedness of ultimate customers for their tasks in the processes of such a distribution in the Slovak Republic (on the grounds of a research with the participation of a representative sample size of 1,820 respondents) are dealt with in the paper. Based on a secondary data analysis, the preparedness of retail institutions for the reverse distribution concept is assessed. The outcome of the paper is a confrontation of the perspectives of two (most significant) entities involved in the reverse distribution channel.}

The second aspect of decision making is the vehicle efficiency as operational level of decision making. The main objective of this paper is to propose models for measuring transport efficiency, as well as to identify main factors that affect transport efficiency. The proposed models are based on Principal Component Analysis and Data Envelopment Analysis approaches.

Assessing target modulation in paired tumor biopsies in patients with solid tumors presents multiple challenges, including procedural issues such as patient safety, ethical considerations, and logistics of sample handling and processing. In addition, the availability of qualified biomarker assay technologies, resources to conduct such studies, and real-time analysis of samples to detect inter-species differences that may affect the determination of optimal sampling time points must be taken into account.

Towards this end, sustainability through product remanufacturing is gaining momentum. However, a key complication for maintaining operational efficiencies during production planning and control of remanufacturing lies in the inability to accurately forecast core returns. These difficulties are mostly attributable to limited visibility and higher levels of uncertainty in reverse logistics. Despite significant advances in the remanufacturing literature over the last two decades, there is not yet a practical approach for modeling core return delay durations when the company is engaged in business with a large remanufacturing product catalog and many customer facilities. This is particularly true for suppliers that engage in both original equipment (OE) service as well as independent after-market (IAM) businesses. This research aims to address these limitations for suppliers by developing a range of hazard rate models for core returns duration modeling. Models are also validated using data from a large global automotive supplier.}

The secondary data related to the demographic profile of blocks were taken from the published census reports. The socioeconomic vulnerability score for each block is developed using a set of 29 indicators selected from the literature review and in consultation with experts. The selected indicators cover the IPCC dimensions of vulnerability (adaptive capacity, sensitivity, and exposure to climate change led hazards). Results of this research conclude that among the six blocks, Soro block is the most vulnerable and Rangeilunda block is the least vulnerable. The most influential factors for socioeconomic vulnerability in the study area include population density, population growth rate, percentage of rural population, distance of cyclone shelter, unemployment, adequate toilet facility, frequency and impact of flood and cyclone, and lack of logistics supports during cyclone. The findings of this study advocate that the interventions for vulnerability reduction and development of adequate coping mechanism should be made for the communities living in such areas.}

Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective study conducted at a tertiary care hospital in Mumbai from January 2016 to December 2017. All patients with healthcare-onset diarrhoea were tested for C. difficile by glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH)/toxin assay or nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT). CDI was defined as either GDH and toxin positive or NAAT positive. The incidence of CDI was calculated per 1000 patient days. Demographic features of patients with CDI including age, sex, duration of hospitalisation before onset of CDI, antibiotic use and treatment administered were summarised. Results: A total of 67 patients had CDI in the study period with a mean incidence of 0.2/1000 patient days. A halving of the CDI incidence was seen after intensification of the CDI prevention bundle. The mean age of affected patients was 64 years and CDI occurred at a median duration of 2 weeks after hospitalisation. Eighty-seven per cent of the patients were on antibiotics at the time of diagnosis of CDI. The crude mortality rate was 22%. Conclusions: CDI is an emerging HAI in India. All hospitals need to set up policies for surveillance, testing, treatment and prevention of CDI based on recent international guidelines and local infrastructure/logistics.}

abstract = {The refugee crisis resulted in a large influx of refugees in the Mediterranean since 2014. However, crises are inherently complex phenomena, whereas the ultimate goal of all involved actors is to provide humanitarian aid to the affected populations. The required supply chain management and logistics operations are characterized by complex decision making whereas coordination between involved actors is necessary for effective aid delivery. Therefore, distributed problem solving based on autonomous and interacting agent can be used as a decision support tool in this field. The purpose of this paper is to address the solution of the refugee settlement site planning problem with an intelligent multi-agent system (MAS) modeling method. In particular, intelligent agents use two well-known multi-criteria decision-making methods (MCDM), Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) and Fuzzy axiomatic design approach with risk factors (RFAD), to rank alternative sites for refugee settlement siting. Up to authors’ knowledge, this study is the first that utilizes MAS and MCDM approaches in a decision support system for refugee settlement planning in literature. The proposed method has been applied to evaluate four currently operating refugee accommodation sites in Greece. Obtained results have confirmed and reflected the current situation in these camp locations.}

abstract = {The restricted continuous facility location problem arises when there is a need to locate a number of facilities to serve a discrete set of demand points, and where the location of a facility can be anywhere on the plane except for in restricted regions. The problem finds applications in urban planning, disaster management, and healthcare logistics. The restricted regions can occur randomly or are known in advance. The paper describes a new model for the problem that is based on multicommodity flows with unknown destinations and defined on a discretization of the plane. The model and discretization are applied to both the deterministic and the stochastic continuous restricted location problem, where the latter is converted into a deterministic equivalent problem by minimizing the expected value of the objective function weighted by the probabilities of scenarios. The paper also describes a Benders decomposition algorithm to optimally solve the model. Extensive computational results are presented on both benchmark instances from the literature and new instances, on both the deterministic and stochastic variant of the problem. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm is superior to an off-the-shelf solver in terms of computational time. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the exact algorithm described here is the first to address both the deterministic and the stochastic variants of continuous restricted location problems with any number of facilities.}

In the process industries this is a very important problem since the environmental impacts are often very significant. Although the assessment of the environmental performance of supply chains is becoming a common practice, this topic still remains very challenging for various reasons. One of them is complexity. Supply chains are complex systems, involving several entities, flows, and actors with frequently opposing views and goals. Analysing such system requires the use of powerful tools, such as quantitative models, capable of handling the various logistics variables and contributing to the understanding of their interactions and trade-offs. Such complexity often results in a simplification of several aspects of the environmental analysis, being one the life cycle scope definition. In this work, we address this issue and through the use of a mixed integer linear model we study the extent to which life cycle scope definition influences managerial decisions in the design and planning of complex supply chains. A real case-study in the pulp and paper industry is explored.}

To promote the exchange of knowledge and expertise relevant to port and customs procedures and simplification of clearance for vessels and cargoes in the Mediterranean, the MEDNET project was launched. As part of the project a common evaluation framework for the performance of ports in the form of a set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) together with a list of the best practices in terms of operations and customs procedures was developed. In total, 61 ports were analyzed and given a KPI regarding traffic, financial, operational and human resources, sustainability and customs procedures. The values were latter crossed with the current good practices on operation in terms of customs procedures. A small correlation between KPIs performance and implantation degree of good practices in customs procedures was found.

Conflicts lead to time losses for all participants of the logistics process, have a negative impact on its safety and increase transportation costs.According to an analysis of scientific works on the subject, issues of reduction in the number of conflicts in route networks have not been sufficiently explored. There are no substantiated methods to resolve the problem, which would improve the performance of route vehicles under the conditions of the existing "gap" between the automobilization level and the urban transport infrastructure development level. Therefore, development of a simulation model for the evaluation of conflicts at stops is relevant from the scientific and practical points of view. A simulation model of vehicle traffic on adjacent "converging" and "diverging" routes is developed for the evaluation of possible conflicts at shared stops. It considers dynamic characteristics of vehicles as well as parameters of routes and stops. This model will allow evaluating quantitative characteristics of conflicts at stops. To decrease the conflict rate of the urban route network, a model optimizing network parameters through distribution of vehicles of various types by routes given full satisfaction of population demands for public transportation is developed. Results of modeling conflicts at stops are characterized by a positive social and economic effect, can be used for the evaluation of conflicts at particular stops of the route network as well as for management decision-making regarding reconstruction of individual route network infrastructure facilities or route network optimization.}

We introduce the layered-packaging taxonomy that highlights new ways to think about product packaging. This taxonomy has two dimensions: the physicality dimension, which is composed of the outer–intermediate–inner packaging layers, and the functionality dimension, which is composed of the purchase–consumption packaging layers. We then build on this taxonomy to present an integrative conceptualization of the sensory aspects of package design as they affect key stages of customer experience.}

It is commonly observed that maquiladoras’ suppliers keep buffer inventories of components in a 3rd party logistics (3PL) warehouse on the US side of border. Maquiladoras will “call-off” the components when they are needed for production runs, often multiple times a day. Each call-off shipment is an international shipment that is involved with export/import procedures and is subject to customs inspection, which often causes delays. Such delivery uncertainty, combined with the 3PL replenishment uncertainty, makes just-in-time (JIT) operations a challenging task for maquiladoras. In this study, we examine how a firm’s logistical performance can be affected by multiple transportation risks and multi-locational buffer inventory strategies in a border-crossing JIT supply chain. Our results show that a firm’s service level is more affected by the border-crossing uncertainty, whereas a firm’s order lead-time performance is predominantly attributed to the 3PL replenishment risk.}

This includes logistics in warehouses where validation of correct items per order can be enhanced with mobile devices. Since handling incorrect orders is a big part of the costs of warehouse maintenance, reducing errors like missed or wrong items should be avoided. Thus, early identification of picking procedures and items picked is beneficial for reducing these errors. By using data glasses and a smartwatch we aim to reduce these errors while also enabling the picker to work hands-free. In this paper, we present an analysis of feature sets for classification of grabbing actions in the order picking process. For this purpose, we created a dataset containing inertial data and egocentric video from four participants performing picking tasks, modeled closely to a real-world warehouse environment. We extract features from the time and frequency domain for inertial data and color and descriptor features from the image data to learn grabbing actions. By using three different supervised learning approaches on inertial and video data, we are able to recognize grabbing actions in a picking scenario. We show that the combination of both video and inertial sensors yields a F-measure of 85.3% for recognizing grabbing actions.}

These requirements and conditions are related to variables like efficiency, flexibility and customer satisfaction, according to the type of customer that will be using the IT tool. The results were obtained from a Principal Component Analysis and Multivariate Factor Analysis. Additionally, the identification of these factors can allow a better design of the IT tool, based on the needs of the customers. Therefore, the ports can be more attractive and efficient in negotiating trade agreements and thus enhance the competitiveness of the region and country. The results show that a single window platform for port communities should customize their services based on the type of user, in this case, were analyzed two types: importers and exporters. The efforts related to the services offered to the importers should focus on the operation part of foreign trade activities. In contrast, exporters have a high affinity for variables related to decision-making that are focused on administration and document management. Futures studies can be made considering all the members of the port community to develop an IT tool that can improve the foreign trade activities in underdeveloped countries.}

Given this evidence, the American Academy of Pediatrics has promoted actions by pediatricians to engage fathers in pediatric care. Despite these recommendations, the mother–child dyad, rather than the mother–father–child triad, remains a frequent focus of care. Furthermore, pediatric care is often leveraged to improve maternal health, such as screening for maternal depression, but paternal health is infrequently addressed even as men tend to exhibit riskier behaviors, poorer primary care utilization, and lower life expectancy. Therefore, increasing efforts by pediatric clinicians to engage fathers may affect the health of both father and child. These efforts to engage fathers are informed by currently used definitions and measures of father involvement, which are discussed here. Factors described in the literature that affect father involvement are also summarized, including culture and context; interpersonal factors; logistics; knowledge and self-efficacy; and attitudes, beliefs, and incentives. Innovative ways to reach fathers both in the clinic and in other settings are currently under investigation, including use of behavior change models, motivational interviewing, mobile technologies, peer support groups, and policy advocacy efforts. These modalities show promise in effectively engaging fathers and improving family health.}

In this problem, a delivery truck that carries a drone on its roof serves customers in coordination with a drone. The drone is considered to complement the truck due to its cost-efficiency and ability to access difficult terrains and to travel without exposure to congestion. This study presents an iterative algorithm that is based on a decomposition approach to minimize delivery completion time. In the first stage of the proposed methodology, the truck route and the customers assigned to the drone are determined. In the second stage, a mixed-integer linear programming model is solved to optimize the drone route by fixing the routing and the assignment decisions that are made in the first stage. Beginning with the shortest truck route, the assignment and the routing decisions are iteratively improved. The solution times of our algorithm are compared with the solution times of the state-of-the-art formulations that are solved by CPLEX. The results demonstrate that our algorithm yields shorter solution times for the instances that we generated with the specified parameters. An optimization-based heuristic algorithm, which obtains solutions for medium-sized instances, is developed by reducing the feasible search area.}

abstract = {Background
Plastic surgery has a long-standing history of being deeply interconnected with global health. This paper reviews the current state of global health as it relates to plastic surgery and makes forecasts for the future.
Methods
This study reviews the most current literature on global plastic surgery, as well as offers insights based on our 2 senior authors' experiences. For our literature search, the MEDLINE database was queried using relevant keywords through both PubMed and OVID user interfaces.
Findings
Early exposure to global plastic surgery often leads to a lifelong involvement. Formal integration of global surgery into residencies is becoming more common. Models of care for global plastic surgery range from small to large groups, spanning the full spectrum of reconstructive plastic surgery. The best of these groups have longitudinal relationships with their operative sites to allow for continuous care. Logistics and funding are crucial for successful care. Technological advances will make long-distance care more facile in the future.
Conclusions
Global plastic surgery is rewarding to both patient and physician. Plastic surgery has been and will continue to be committed to providing high-quality global health care.}

abstract = {Background
Little is known about the relation between patient complexity and nursing care of total hip arthroplasty (THA) patients. To improve patient care and hospital logistics, the aim of this study is to gain insight into the relation between patient complexity and the nursing staff's actual and perceived workload at an orthopedic ward during admission for a THA.
Design
Prospective cohort study of 45 THA patients in the year 2014. Duration and type of nursing care activities were recorded during the first postoperative morning. A questionnaire was used to analyze the perceived workload of the nursing staff. Both actual and perceived workload were analyzed for their relation with patient complexity, expressed in the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), Katz Activities of Daily Life score (Katz-ADL) and Body Mass Index (BMI).
Results
No relation was found between actual workload and measures for patient complexity. The perceived workload of the nursing staff was related to two complexity measures: ASA (r=0.71; p<0.001) and CCI (r=0.65; p=0.002).
Conclusion
Patient comorbidity is related to the perceived workload of the nursing staff during admission for a THA. Patient complexity is not related to actual workload. This study gives a first insight into the relation between patient comorbidity and nursing staff workload, to try to improve staffing numbers at the ward as well as patient care in the process.}

The model is applied to find optimal services schedule in a real-world case study. In order to handle demand and travel time inherent variability, the stochastic service network design problem is addressed. Simulation modeling is used to efficiently account for real stochastic behavior with skewed continuous distributions. Such distinctive distribution shapes were commonly reported in transportation research studies that addressed the travel time reliability modeling. Results indicate that the SBO-Model can indeed provide reliable service schedules even under realistic complex stochasticity. The main finding is that, in order to solve efficiently such stochastic optimization problem, we need to go beyond the mean and variance estimates by considering the empirical distributions of uncertain parameters. Specifically, when the data exhibit skewness and/or multimodality, which are commonly found due to the traffic congestion. The originality of this work lies in the integration of stochastic models, commonly used in the transportation research field, for solving logistics planning problem generally addressed by Operations Research community.}

The history of ERAS, details of the components of the approach and the underlying rationale are explained. Evidence on outcomes achieved by using the ERAS approach in other orthopaedic and complex surgical procedures is then outlined. Data on major spinal surgery rates and current practice are reviewed; the rationale for using ERAS in major spinal surgery is discussed, and potential challenges to its adoption are acknowledged. A thorough literature search is then undertaken to examine the use of ERAS pathways in major spinal surgery, and the results are presented. The article then reviews the evidence to support the application of individual ERAS components such as patient education, multimodal pain management, surgical approach, blood loss, nutrition and physiotherapy in major spinal surgery, and discusses the need for further robust research to be undertaken. The article concludes that given the rising costs of surgery and levels of patient dissatisfaction, an ERAS pathway that focuses on optimising clinical procedures by adopting evidence-based practice and improving logistics should enable major spinal surgery patients to recover more quickly with lower rates of morbidity and improved longer-term outcomes.}

In Brazil, only 17% of the awarded capacity in the first ten auction rounds reached commercial operation within the set out deadline. In this article, we investigate the causes for these delays and discuss potential mitigation measures, based on expert interviews and extensive data analysis. The most severe delays were caused by expansion to the transmission grid. Delays in the supply of wind turbines also led to significant project setbacks. Other factors could be considered of minor relevance, but have led in individual cases to significant delays. These include factors related to project financing, project or environmental licenses, logistics, land-use conflicts and poor project management. Brazil effectively reduced delays caused by transmission grid expansion through amendments to the auction design. Our analysis also shows that options to further mitigate delays through an advanced auction design are limited, as they lead to conflicts with other energy policy objectives, e.g. local production of wind turbines, or because the delays are caused by factors beyond the control of the project developers.}

abstract = {Service provider opportunism is a serious concern in third party logistics (3PL) relationships. However, our knowledge about the antecedents of 3PL providers' opportunism is limited. According to transaction cost economics (TCE), increased transaction costs cause opportunism. This study incorporates key TCE constructs (environmental uncertainty, specific assets, and opportunism) and conducts a transaction cost analysis. We argue that environmental uncertainty and specific assets create exchange hazards that result in opportunism. Meanwhile, specific assets reduce coordination costs raised by environmental uncertainty. Building on these arguments, this study tests a model that hypothesizes that environmental uncertainty (demand, supply, and technology uncertainty), and specific assets (user- and provider-specific assets) are positively related to opportunism, and that environmental uncertainty is positively related to specific assets. Structural equation modeling is used to examine data from 247 3PL relationships in China. The results show that demand uncertainty decreases opportunism, supply uncertainty increases opportunism, and technology uncertainty does not have a significant effect. User-specific assets increase opportunism, while provider-specific assets decrease opportunism. Demand and supply uncertainty have positive effects on user-specific assets, but non-significant effects on provider-specific assets, while technology uncertainty does not have a significant impact on user or provider-specific assets. In general, our findings are supported by the rationale of TCE, and industrial or cultural factors can explain several surprising findings. This study contributes to 3PL literature and practice.}

One party (the transporter) moves a sessile partner (the cargo). This results in asymmetric associations ranging from temporary marriages of convenience to long-term fellow travellers. In the context of the ‘microbial market’, the parties offer very different services in exchange. We discuss bacteria transporting bacteria, eukaryotic microorganisms moving bacteria, and bacteria facilitating the spread of eukaryotes – and ask what the benefits are, the methods of study, and the consequences of multispecies, swarming logistics networks.}

It aims to understand how changes in the transport conditions of a region can affect its own and neighboring regions' ability to improve foreign trade. The proposed dynamic spatial panel model extends previous ones in the scant related literature, by accounting for spillover effects and own time lagged responses of export flows to changes in variables related, among others, to network distance and accessibility. The results suggest a considerable number of indirect (spatially lagged) effects that are significant for the regional export trade, including those of highway corridors. Agglomeration economies positively affect manufacturing exports by ship and truck in the own prefecture, while manufacturing specialization has a significant impact on maritime transport. It is also shown that failure to account for long-run responses can significantly underestimate the effect of changes in the distance to major transport facilities on export volume. Especially the enhancement of interregional accessibility and market potential has a major impact on the agricultural exports by road. The findings have implications for the coordination of regional investment policies and the planning of the mainland transport system in connection with the location of logistics hubs.}

However, the use of objective functions is based on assumptions that in practical cases can be inaccurate. To overcome this problem, we have developed a retrospective analysis procedure that validates the degree of acceptability of the optimal reduced configuration at a local and global level. The procedure has been applied to a case study in Apulia, Italy, finding that the optimal reduced network was unable to recover the measured values of the monitored parameter of two discarded locations, making it unable to accomplish its monitoring goals.}

I argue that such (re)alignments of biological and artificial intelligence have been enabled by a paradigmatic infrastructuralization of the brain in contemporary neuroscience. This infrastructuralization is based in methodologies that epistemically liken the brain to complex systems of an entirely different scale (i.e., global logistics) and has given rise to diverse research efforts that target the neuronal infrastructures of higher cognitive functions such as empathy and creativity. What is at stake in this process is no less than the shape of brains to come and a revised understanding of the intelligent and creative social subject.}

Surgical treatment options for facial melanomas include conventional excision with postoperative margin assessment, Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) with immunostains (MMS-I), and slow MMS. Patient preferences for these surgical options have not been studied.
Objectives
To evaluate patient preferences for surgical treatment of facial melanoma and to determine how patients value the relative importance of different surgical attributes.
Methods
Participants completed a 2-part study consisting of a stated preference survey and a choice-based conjoint analysis experiment.
Results
Patients overwhelmingly (94.3%) rated local recurrence risk as very important and ranked it as the most important attribute of surgical treatment for facial melanoma. Via choice-based conjoint analysis, patients ranked the following surgical attributes from highest to lowest in importance: local recurrence rate, out-of-pocket cost, chance of second surgical visit, timing of reconstruction, travel time, and time in office for the procedure. Consistent with their prioritization of low local recurrence rates, more than 73% of respondents selected MMS-I or slow MMS as their preferred treatment option for a facial melanoma.
Limitations
Data were obtained from a single health system.
Conclusion
Patients prefer surgical treatment options that minimize risk for local recurrence. Logistics for travel and treatment have less influence on patient preferences. Most survey participants chose MMS-I to maximize local cure and convenience of care.}

Examining real case study of a Sponge-iron (SI) industry, it is observed that how recycling reduces the environmental pollution and increase the livelihood status of the people associated with collecting scrap and used items for recycling in the production process itself. To validate the model statistically, we have utilized the normal distribution and computed p-values. Due to financial constraints of industrial management, we have studied the flexibilities of different cost vectors by means of the Triangular dense fuzzy lock set (TDFLS) rule along with its locking and unlocking property for final decision-making. Moreover, our findings suggest that the decision maker (DM) might have to focus on remanufacturing and recycling for pollution reduction and creation of jobs.

This review is interlinked with a qualitative data analysis based on semi-structured interviews with representatives of ocean carriers, which are key actors determining empty container repositioning. Empirical evidence obtained from fieldwork in the Czech Republic, albeit limited, is used to illustrate empty repositioning management by ocean carriers in the Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) landlocked hinterlands, which have been neglected in research with a specific geographic scope. By addressing the research questions and conducting the analysis, the authors determine whether empty container repositioning is a problem only concerning equipment allocation by an ocean carrier or requires a collaborative resolution involving various parties engaged in container movements in landlocked hinterlands. This article confirms that most existing literature dealing with empty container repositioning ignores the actual dynamics of landlocked hinterlands as well as business practitioners' perspective. The authors' analysis of the empirical research complements and challenges the reviewed research studies. Based on the analysis, ocean carriers seem to be unwilling to revise their actual container management strategies focused on maritime repositioning, disregarding the potential and importance of intermodal repositioning approaches based on market collaboration. Regarding further research directions, the authors suggest the research replicability and its extension.}

However, to manage such a sheer number of deployed devices, solutions to provide over-the-air firmware updates are required. This paper analyses the feasibility of over-the-air (partial) software updates for three LPWAN technologies (LoRa, SigFox and IEEE-802.15.4g) and discusses the best suited update method for different scenarios: full system updates, application updates and network stack updates. The results indicate that full firmware upgrades consume a substantial amount of energy, especially for the lowest bit-rate LPWAN technologies such as SigFox which drains a single AA battery with 2% when performing a version update. However, technologies with a similar range (i.e. LoRa SF12) require only 0.12%. The trade-off between range and energy (or bit-rate) becomes clear when considering that the least sensitive technology (IEEE-802.15.4g-OFDM) consumes only 0.0001%. Partial updates require significantly less energy for all technologies. Adding a single application uses 6 to 38 times less energy compared to a firmware update, depending on the update method and LPWAN technology. Even partial network stack updates (i.e. MAC) cost 3 to 8 times less energy, making over-the-air updates feasible.}

abstract = {Energy efficiency has become a primary energy policy goal in Europe and many countries and has conditioned the policies towards energy-intensive sectors such as road freight transport. However, energy efficiency improvements can lead to changes in the demand for energy services that offset some of the achieved energy savings in the form of rebound effects. Consequently, forecasts of energy savings can be overstated. This paper analyses the energy efficiency and rebound effects for road freight transport in 15 European countries during the 1992–2012 period. We use a recent methodology to estimate an energy demand function using a stochastic frontier analysis approach and examine the influence of key features of rebound effect in the road freight transport sector. We obtain, on average, a fuel efficiency of 89% and a rebound effect of 4%. Our results indicate that the achieved energy efficiencies are retained to a large extent. We also find, among other results, that the rebound effect is higher in countries with higher fuel efficiency and better quality of logistics. Finally, a simulation analysis shows significant environmental externalities costs even in countries with lower rebound effect.}

abstract = {In the domain of developing production systems, the design of a good factory is typically distributed over many disciplines and organizations to cover all involved technologies and levels of detail (process, logistics, machinery etc.). Modelling and simulation used to support the design process within each of the disciplines typically represent different contexts and perspectives. To cross the discipline borders and share experiences, to encourage innovation and make holistic decisions, one challenge is to interrelate various digital models and to reach a mutual system understanding between stakeholders. This paper presents a study based on principles from Social Science, Production Engineering, Computer Science and Information Design to address cross-disciplinary collaboration. Principles concerning visual communication and theories in regard to tangible boundary objects are used to clarify how to describe production system interdependencies in a digital factory context. Work in process of implementing a digital factory framework based on the principles is described, with a use case demonstrating the development of a digital factory for a new type of automotive vehicle.}

Police, fire, and other Emergency Medical Services (EMS) comprise the core first responders to nearly any emergency, and these personnel have numerous responsibilities throughout the Airport Emergency Plan (AEP). The National Incident Management System, created after 9/11, is the standard method of managing disasters, incidents, and other events in the United States. It is based on three principles: Incident Command System (ICS), Multi-Agency Coordination, and Public Information. The five functions of ICS are command, operations, planning, logistics, and finance/administration. For some incidents, an intelligence/investigative function is added.}

abstract = {Prefabricated prefinished volumetric construction (PPVC) is an innovative and cleaner approach that has restructured the production of the construction industry. It can improve the workflow continuity, increase the efficiencies in the use of resources, minimize construction wastes, and reduce the number of on-site contractors as well as construction durations. While the benefits of PPVC have been widely recognized over past two decades, the constraints on using PPVC remains unexplored. As a result, the aims of this study are to investigate the significant constraints demotivating the adoption of PPVC and to propose a group of feasible mitigation strategies to tackle these constraints. To achieve these goals, a comprehensive literature review was conducted first, followed by a structured questionnaire survey administered to 41 Singapore-based construction organizations. Lastly, an in-depth case study was conducted to verify the empirical findings. The analysis results showed that the top five significant constraints were “extensive coordination required prior to and during construction”, “need for additional project planning and design efforts”, “increased transportation and logistics considerations”, “requirement for early commitment”, and “higher initial cost than conventional construction method.” It also revealed the top three most effective mitigation strategies: “encouraging close collaborations between project stakeholders during the early phase of the project”, “use of BIM to improve coordination and facilitate communication among project stakeholders”, and “offering training courses for project team and workers to enhance their knowledge and skills”. This study contributes to the body of knowledge by examining the constraints and mitigation strategies for the adoption of PPVC. Also, the findings from this study are informative to the industry practitioners to have a better understanding and implementation of PPVC.}

This paper also aims to examine the different viewpoints of sustainability issues and the preventive actions taken by companies in terms of controlling carbon dioxide emissions and proper disposal of tires, lubricant oils, accessories and spare parts. Finally, taking the perspective of these companies, this paper examines their difficulties in meeting environmental regulations. The research involved a survey completed by 185 representatives of different types of companies, including shippers (represented by manufacturers), LSPs (logistics service providers) and carriers. The non-linear canonical correlation was calculated to verify the opinions of these representatives from different companies regarding issues that impact on the environment, the preventive actions they adopt to reduce their environmental impact and their difficulties in meeting environmental regulations. The results show that shippers and LSPs have the same perceptions regarding these sustainability issues and preventive actions. In addition, the companies perceive high costs and the lack of training for their partners as the major challenges experienced in addressing these issues and undertaking preventive actions. Therefore they need to plan their transportation activities.}

One conceivable scenario of using a drone in conjunction with a traditional delivery truck to distribute parcels is discussed in earlier literature and termed the parallel drone scheduling traveling salesman problem (PDSTSP). This study extends the problem by considering two different types of drone tasks: drop and pickup. After a drone completes a drop, the drone can either fly back to depot to deliver the next parcels or fly directly to another customer for pickup. Integrated scheduling of multiple depots hosting a fleet of trucks and a fleet of drones is further studied to achieve an operational excellence. A vehicle that travels near the boundary of the coverage area might be more effective to serve customers that belong to the neighboring depot. This problem is uniquely modeled as an unrelated parallel machine scheduling with sequence dependent setup, precedence-relationship, and reentrant, which gives us a framework to effectively consider those operational challenges. A constraint programming approach is proposed and tested with problem instances of m-truck, m-drone, m-depot, and hundred-customer distributed across an 8-mile square region.}

Two firms (decision makers) sequentially decide on the configuration of their hub networks trying to maximize their own market shares. The customers choose one firm based on the cost of service provided by these firms. Mathematical formulations are presented for the problems of the first and second firms (the leader and the follower, respectively) and Simulated Annealing (SA) based solution algorithms are proposed for solving these problems both in single and multiple allocation settings. Extensive computational experiments show the capability of the proposed solution algorithms to obtain the optimal solutions in short computational times. Some managerial insights are also derived based on the obtained results.}

abstract = {Mechanical energy harvesters have not much benefited from the significant advantages of additive manufacturing techniques because the functional materials are not compatible with most printable schemes. In this work, a triboelectric nanogenerator is designed and demonstrated only by additive manufacturing methods. The all-printed triboelectric nanogenerator (AP-TENG) combines the advantages of 2D and 3D printing technologies. The structural frame is formed by 3D printing as a core-shell structure, which effectively converts external vibrations into continuous sliding motion. The contact layers are created by 2D inkjet printing with precisely patterned grating structure. The nanoscale printed contact layers made on nanocellulose paper assure high output power and abrasion durability. The un-optimized AP-TENG here produces a maximum instantaneous voltage of 98.2V and a maximum instantaneous current of 13.7μA, with a threshold vibration amplitude of 1mm and an optimum frequency range of 30–60Hz. The AP-TENG can be autonomously manufactured by printers at the point-of-demand anywhere, making it particularly attractive in remote locations including other planets and the International Space Station where the logistics is complex and expensive.}

However the longevity of these historical structures is threatened by extreme weather so in the UK, the General Lighthouse Authorities comprising Trinity House, the Northern Lighthouse Board and the Commissioners of Irish Lights are supporting three British universities in a program of linked experimental and analytical investigations of full-scale performance under extreme wave loading. The aim is to use structural models calibrated by modal testing to deduce wave loading from response recorded by long-term monitoring. The paper describes the procedures for modal testing, taking into account the constraints on access, logistics, unfamiliar layout and time. The test program sequentially covered Les Hanois, Wolf Rock, Longships and Bishops Rock lighthouses over summer 2016 followed by Fastnet Rock in December 2016. Some conventional techniques of forced and ambient vibration testing were used along with some unusual excitation methods. Results from the measurements and observations on the particular challenges associated with testing two of these iconic structures are presented.}

The model coordinated strategic and tactical decisions. Strategic decisions include the number, capacity, and location of storage yards and biorefineries. Tactical decisions included the amount of biomass shipped, processed and inventoried during a time period. The model was validated using the state of Michigan, in the Midwest United States, as the base case. It was uncovered that trucks are preferred over rail for short-haul deliveries while rails are more effective for long-haul transport. Taking advantage of these benefits, the multimodal transport model provided more cost effective solutions.}

The manufacturer has to process a set of jobs at the upstream stage and at the downstream stage. The 3PL provider is in charge of transportation of semi-finished products from the upstream stage to the downstream stage. The manufacturer's objective is to minimize makespan Cmax and the 3PL provider's objective is to minimize transportation cost TC. We investigate three scenarios, corresponding to different types of contract: (i) decentralized scenario with strict responsiveness; (ii) decentralized scenario with flexible responsiveness; (iii) centralized (cooperative) scenario. We provide exact polynomial-time algorithms or prove the NP-completeness of the scheduling problems in these three scenarios. Moreover, we evaluate and compare various scenarios through a large set of computational experiments. The results show that cooperation may bring significant benefits to both actors. The benefit for the 3PL provider is particularly high if compared to situations in which the manufacturing sequence is fixed. Also the manufacturer can benefit from relaxing the job-by-job responsiveness constraint in favor of an integrated schedule which appropriately accounts for the role of the 3PL provider.}
