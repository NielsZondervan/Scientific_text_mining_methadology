abstract = {The bale collection problem (BCP) appears after harvest operations of agricultural crops. The solution to the BCP is defined by the sequence in which bales, that lie scattered across the field, are collected. This paper presents a constrained k-means algorithm and nearest neighbor approach to the BCP, which minimizes travel time and hence fuel consumption. The constraints imposed on the k-means procedure is not the usual condition that certain groups of objects must be clustered together, but rather that the cluster centers must lie on valid locations, which may be specified as functions or sets of points. The algorithm can be incorporated into precision agricultural systems to assist in the planning of routes for loaders and bale wagons. The approach is experimentally tested on a simulated study area like those found in real situations.}

The Rctvrp is a variant of the well-known capacitated vehicle routing problem and models the problem of routing vehicles in the cash-in-transit sector. In the Rctvrp, the risk associated with a robbery represents a critical aspect that is treated as a limiting factor subject to a maximum risk threshold. A new metaheuristic, called aco-lns is developed. It combines the ant colony heuristic for the travelling salesman problem and a variable neighbourhood descent within an large neighbourhood search framework. A new library of Rctvrp instances with known optimal solutions is proposed. The aco-lns is extensively tested on small, medium and large benchmark instances and compared with all existing solution approaches for the Rctvrp.}

abstract = {The warehouse-on-wheels (WOW) policy is a widespread concept to implement material supply in just-in-time production systems. Instead of storing part inventories directly on the shop-floor where space is notoriously scare, the transport vehicles that deliver the materials serve as mobile storages, either while waiting in the trailer yard or while docking at inbound delivery gates. We investigate a vehicle scheduling problem under the WOW policy between a single distribution center and a production facility. Multiple containers of parts each associated with an individual delivery date and a–potentially individual–capacity requirement are to be shipped to the factory. The docking time of transporting vehicles is determined by their respective freight from the delivery date of the most urgent container up to that of the least urgent one. Only then, a vehicle may return to the distribution center to transship another subset of containers. We formalize the resulting vehicle scheduling problem under different objectives, investigate the computational complexity of the problem and develop efficient solution procedures for important problem variants.}

abstract = {Emission reduction targets are driving a new way of thinking and a range of technological solutions within the shipping and port sectors. So far, four major solutions have been identified for cleaner ship fuels: (i) Marine Gas Oil, (ii) Heavy Fuel Oil + Scrubber, (iii) Liquefied Natural Gas – herein referred to as LNG, and (iv) Methanol. From those alternatives, most experts recognise LNG as the most developed fuel solution, both in the short- and in the medium-term. In 2014, the United States Energy Information Administration (EIA) as well as the International Gas Union (IGU) reported a significant growth of terminals for LNG liquefaction and regasification. Moreover, the European Commission, as part of its Clean Power for Transport package, has adopted in 2014 a Directive ‘on the deployment of alternative fuels, recharging and refuelling infrastructure’. Nevertheless, there are several constraints that need to be addressed yet, more particularly in LNG importing countries in order to meet the future demand of the expected LNG-powered fleet. They include facilities for storage and transhipment of LNG for fuelling berths, barges and ships. This paper provides an overview of the use of LNG for the maritime industry and examines its potential for future growth on the basis of the LNG-powered fleet (current and in order) and planned expansion of LNG bunkering facilities, mainly in European ports. Most data here presented come from a variety of sources including international databases such as IHS Maritime, ports websites, and reports from LNG-related organisations. In addition, the results from past and current EU-funded projects in this field were reviewed and consultations were conducted among representatives from participating ports. Overall, it was found that the LNG powered fleet is expanding slowly and the trend is towards building LNG-propelled vessels for smaller ship sizes and short distances. Although Norway is the newbuilding front runner, other countries, mainly in Europe (e.g. the Netherlands, Denmark, Italy, and Malta), have ordered an important amount of new buildings. Similarly, European ports are expanding considerably their LNG bunkering capacities. Remarkable are the activities conducted by the ports of Spain and Italy with planned expansion for LNG handling and storage facilities beyond 2020. Finally, with regards to regulations, while international standards have been adopted for the construction and operation of LNG powered ships and crew's training, no harmonisation exists yet for LNG facilities in ports. The latter have allowed major ports to undertake independent initiatives to overcome the situation.}

abstract = {We consider a fleet of electric freight vehicles (EFVs) that must deliver goods to a set of customers over the course of multiple days. In an urban environment, EFVs are typically charged at a central depot and rarely use public charging stations during delivery routes. Therefore, the charging schedule at the depot must be planned ahead of time so as to allow the vehicles to complete their routes at minimal cost. Vehicle fleet operators are subject to commercial electricity rate plans, which should be accounted for in order to provide an accurate estimation of the energy-related costs and restrictions. In addition, high vehicle utilization rates can accelerate battery aging, thereby requiring degradation mitigation considerations. We develop and solve a comprehensive mathematical model that incorporates a large variety of features associated with the use of EFVs. These include a realistic charging process, time-dependent energy costs, battery degradation, grid restrictions, and facility-related demand charges. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted in order to draw managerial insights regarding the impact of such features on the charging schedules of EFVs.}

Despite such benefits, freight vehicles often cause adverse impacts on the economy, environment and society such as air pollution, reduced mobility, congestion and road casualties. Local authorities implement various regulations and initiatives to mitigate the problems caused by freight vehicles and to decrease conflicts between various road users. The aim of this chapter is to investigate how institutional influences on local authorities determine urban freight transport policy, paying particular attention to three pressure factors (coercive, normative and mimetic) that cause institutional isomorphism. The empirical study compares three countries (Scotland, England and Sweden) based on data collected from 11 cities, each exhibiting different levels of intervention in terms of UFT policy. Our findings showed that the impact of normative and mimetic factors on local authorities is more intense than the impact of coercive factors, with social pressure generally being stronger than national government mandate. The case cities in England and particularly Scotland demonstrated a limited vision when incorporating urban freight in their local transport planning, being reluctant to enforce restrictions on users in order to meet urban freight goals. By contrast, evidence from Sweden suggests that a better relationship between public and private stakeholders makes it easier to implement freight policies in partnership.}

Loading/unloading bays are generally viewed as an effective way to avoid freight vehicles double-parking, but are often misused by non-freight vehicles. We assess the potential of reducing freight vehicles double-parking mobility impacts by changing: (a) the spatial configuration (number, location, size) of loading/unloading bays and, (b) the non-freight vehicles parking rules compliance levels. Parking demand models were created with data from an establishment-based freight survey and a parking observation exercise. Two case studies were defined for 1km2 zones in the city of Lisbon, Portugal. Alternative bay systems were derived from an iterative implementation of the “maximize capacitated coverage” algorithm to a range of bays to be located. Parking operations in current and alternative bay systems were compared using a microsimulation. Bay systems’ ability in reducing double-parking impacts was assessed via a set of indicators (e.g., average speed). Freight traffic causes a disproportionate amount of externalities and the current bay configuration leads to greater mobility impacts than some of the proposed systems. Enforcement was a crucial element in reducing parking operations impact on traffic flow in one of the case-studies. Road network characteristics were demonstrated to play a role in the adequate strategy of arranging the spatial configuration of bays.}

The tools used to accomplish this task are custom built spreadsheets which require large amounts of time and effort to use, update, and keep free of errors. This research presents a transient stochastic simulation–optimization model of the in-theater bulk fuel supply chain, where the simulation model is used to simulate the performance of the fuel supply chain under a particular fuel distribution policy and the optimization portion is used to update the policy so that it results in the performance desired by the Army fuel planner. The fuel distribution policy can then be used to derive the daily loading plan. Due to the multi-objective nature of the problem, the set of policies that form the efficient frontier are all candidate policies for the Army fuel planner to select from. Results of experimentation with a wide variety of supply chain scenarios indicate that, for a given supply chain scenario, the optimization portion of the model identifies a set of fuel distribution policies that address the objectives of the Army fuel planner. In addition, the simulation–optimization model comfortably solves the largest supply chain scenarios the Army fuel planner would reasonably be expected to encounter.}

Amongst others projects at North Sea face considerable interruptions due to severe weather conditions. The problem we refer to consists of determining the renting period of the offshore installation vessels and the scheduling of the operations for building the wind farm. Planners need to make these decisions under the uncertain wind states. A deterministic offshore wind turbine installation model is not suitable to capture the uncertainties which may leave the vessel resource unused or vessel being sent offshore in unfavorable conditions. Accordingly, this study proposes a model that considers disruptions arising from uncertain weather conditions which stand as the main challenge for such projects. As the compact formulation fails to provide solutions due to the large number of scenarios, an approach based on Benders decomposition is developed. The tool is applied to two major wind farm projects, “Bard 1” and “Borkum West” at the North Sea using real weather data over two years. The two-stage model leans to conservatively use the suitable conditions in advance to avoid huge waiting costs incurred under severe weather. Motivated by experts at Wagenborg and MPI Offshore, we extend our experiments to analyze cases where plants are build further away from the shore. The tool presented in this study is suitable for being used in the planning of wind farm projects providing competent solutions.}

While previous models assume sequential commissioning of the lift and vehicles, we propose a parallel processing policy for the system, under which an arrival transaction can request the lift and the vehicle simultaneously. To investigate the performance of this policy, we formulate a fork-join queueing network in which an arrival transaction will be split into a horizontal movement task served by the vehicle and a vertical movement task served by the lift. We develop an approximation method based on decomposition of the fork-join queueing network to estimate the system performance. We build simulation models to validate the effectiveness of analytical models. The results show that the fork-join queueing network is accurate in estimating the system performance under the parallel processing policy. Numerical experiments and a real case are carried out to compare the system response time of retrieval transactions under parallel and sequential processing policies. The results show that, in systems with less than 10 tiers, the parallel processing policy outperforms the sequential processing policy by at least 5.51 percent. The advantage of parallel processing policy is decreasing with the rack height and the aisle length. In systems with more than 10 tiers and a length to height ratio larger than 7, we can find a critical retrieval transaction arrival rate, below which the parallel processing policy outperforms the sequential processing policy.}

Industry data was acquired through observations and time studies at 12 facilities in North America. Models of pallet component breakdown patterns were used to characterize the carbon equivalent emissions of pallet remanufacturing over the predicted service life. Results show that materials account for the vast majority of remanufacturing operation emissions with three board components responsible for 50–90% of total remanufacturing emissions. The loading and handling environment significantly impacts remanufacturing emissions thus breakeven points where remanufacturing emissions exceed those from newly manufactured pallets are provided for each condition. Also, a pallet-cross-docking policy was shown to reduce emissions when compared to a take-back policy. Finally, a linear optimization model is provided to understand the benefits of preemptive component repair. Results show that preemptive remanufacturing schedules can reduce carbon equivalent emissions by up to 40%.

As a tactical level decision-making tool in a port, a yard template determines the assignment of spaces (subblocks) in a yard for arriving vessels, which visit the port periodically. The objective of yard template planning is to minimize the transportation cost of moving containers around the yard. To handle yard template planning, a mixed integer programming model is proposed that also takes into account traffic congestion in the yard. A further complication is that the cycle time of the vessels' periodicities is not uniform and varies among them, perhaps being one week, ten days, or two weeks, etc. However, this multiple cycle time of the periodicities of vessel arrival patterns, which complicates the yard template decision, is also considered in the model. Moreover, a local branching based solution method and a Particle Swarm Optimization based solution method are developed for solving the model. Numerical experiments are also conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, which can save around 24% of the transportation costs of yard trucks when compared with the commonly used First-Come-First-Served decision rule. Moreover, the proposed solution methods can not only solve the proposed model within a reasonable time, but also obtain near-optimal results with about 0.1–2% relative gap.}

Throughout the past few decades, a range of solutions to reduce the negative impact of urban freight transport have been researched, tested and implemented. Since the start of this millennium, authors have been stating that successful measures and solutions require co-operation between the different (commercial and public) stakeholders. In the 1990's, Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff proposed the model of a Triple Helix of university-industry-government relations for explaining innovation in knowledge-based economies. The Triple Helix states that innovation happens at the intersection of three institutional spaces and that there is an important role to be played by universities and knowledge institutions. In urban freight transport, the idea that innovation is driven by commercial and public actors as well as researchers is not very common. In this paper, we use the demonstrations of the European FP7 project Straightsol to confront the Triple Helix model with innovation in urban freight transport. For each case, we explore the role of industry, government and knowledge institution and the mutual dynamics and interactions and analyse how this contributed to innovation.}

Our forecasting methods' arsenal includes Croston's method, SBA and TSB as well as some more recent non-parametric advances, but none of these can identify and extrapolate patterns existing in data; this is essential as these patterns do appear quite often, driven by infrequent but nevertheless repetitive managerial practices. One could claim such patterns could be picked up by Artificial Intelligence approaches, however these do need large training datasets, unfortunately non-existent in industrial time series. Nearest neighbors (NN) can however operate in these latter contexts, and pick up patterns even in short series. In this research we propose applying NN for supply chain data and we investigate the conditions under which these perform adequately through an extensive simulation. Furthermore, via an empirical investigation in automotive data we provide evidence that practitioners could benefit from employing supervised NN approaches. The contribution of this research is not in the development of a new theory, but in the proposition of a new conceptual framework that brings existing theory (i.e. NN) from Computer Science and Statistics and applies it successfully in an SCM setting.}

The key to success is the last-mile product delivery (LMD) – the last stage of the supply chain, where the ordered product is delivered to the final consumer’s location. One innovative proposal puts foundations in a new delivery model where a professional delivery fleet (PF) is supplemented partially or fully with crowdshipping. The main idea of crowdshipping is to involve ordinary people – in our case in-store shoppers – in the delivery of packages to other customers. In return, occasional couriers (OC) are offered a small compensation. In hitherto formulated problems it was assumed that OCs always accept delivery tasks assigned to them. In this paper we consider OCs as independent agents, which are free to reject assignments. The main contribution of the paper is an original bi-level methodology for matching and routing problem in LMD with OCs and the PF. The goal is to use crowdshipping to reduce the total delivery cost in a same-day last-mile delivery system with respect to occasional couriers’ freedom to accept or reject the assigned delivery. We introduce probability to represent each OC’s willingness to perform the delivery to a given final customer. We study the OCs’ willingness to accept or reject delivery tasks assigned to them and the influence of their decision on the total delivery cost associated to both the OCs’ compensation fees and the delivery cost generated by the PF used for the delivery of remaining parcels.}

This commonly observed hazard causes some road sections to be closed and may even disconnect the road network. In the immediate disaster response phase work teams are dispatched to open a subset of roads to reconnect the network. Closed roads are traversable only after they are unblocked/cleared by one of the teams. The main objective of this research is to provide an efficient solution method to generate a synchronized work schedule for the road clearing teams. The solution should specify the synchronized routes of each clearing team so that: 1) connectivity of the network is regained, and 2) none of the closed roads are traversed unless their unblocking/clearing procedure is finished. In this study we develop an exact Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) formulation to solve this problem. Furthermore, we propose a matheuristic that is based on an MIP-relaxation and a local search algorithm. We prove that the optimality gap of the relaxation solution is bounded by K times the lower bound obtained from the relaxed model, where K is the number of teams. We show computationally that the matheuristic obtains optimal or near-optimal solutions.}

The aim of this research is to understand how the capabilities of a large humanitarian organization help support kit management. The method used is a multiple case study on kitting activities that are managed by a large United Nations agency. Kits offer the possibility to combine both the knowledge and skills from technical specialists and local country office staff to offer a relevant solution for emergency response. Developing relevant kits for the humanitarian context require strong collaboration between partners in the preparedness phase and thorough follow up in monitoring and evaluation to develop standards and build up relevant knowledge. With proper kit management comes improvement in flexibility, timeliness and quality and these can be shared across supply chains when kits are transferred from one humanitarian organization to another.}

Road transportation is responsible for a considerable part of global emissions. Temperature-controlled transportation exhausts even more emissions than ambient temperature transport because of the extra fuel requirements for cooling and because of leakage of refrigerant. The transportation sector is under pressure to improve both its environmental and economic performance. To explore opportunities to reach this goal, the Load-Dependent Vehicle Routing Problem (LDVRP) model has been developed to optimize routing decisions taking into account fuel consumption and emissions related to the load of the vehicle. However, this model does not take refrigeration related emissions into account. We therefore propose an extension of the LDVRP model to optimize routing decisions and to account for refrigeration emissions in temperature-controlled transportation systems. This extended LDVRP model is applied in a case study in the Dutch frozen food industry. We show that taking the emissions caused by refrigeration in road transportation can result in different optimal routes and speeds compared with the LDVRP model and the standard Vehicle Routing Problem model. Moreover, taking the emissions caused by refrigeration into account improves the estimation of emissions related to temperature-controlled transportation. This model can help to reduce emissions of temperature-controlled road transportation.}

abstract = {An important problem confronting port cities is where and how to accommodate port growth. Larger ships combined with increased container throughput require more yard space and generate more traffic, straining the urban fabric in the vicinity of the port. A promising solution to this problem is the development of urban intermodal container terminals (IMTs) that interface with both road and rail (or possibly inland waterway) networks. This raises two linked choices; where to locate the intermodal terminals and what will be their likely usage by multiple shippers, each having a choice of whether or not to use the IMT as part of an intermodal transport chain. The use of an IMT by a shipper indicates the shipper's choice of intermodal transport, which comprises a combined use of a high capacity mode (rail or barge between the port and the IMT) and trucks (between the IMT and the cargo origin or destination). The overall problem therefore comprises a mode choice problem embedded within a facility location problem. This paper employs the method of entropy maximisation to combine a logit mode choice model with a facility location model, leading to a non-linear mixed integer programming model. The principal features of the entropy maximising facility location model are illustrated by small and large numerical examples.}

The VRPSPD can arise in many transportation systems involving both distribution and collection operations. Originally, the VRPSPD assumes a homogeneous fleet of vehicles to serve the customers. However, in many practical situations, there are different types of vehicles available to perform the pickup and delivery operations. In this study, the original version of the VRPSPD is extended by assuming the fleet of vehicles to be heterogeneous. The Heterogeneous Vehicle Routing Problem with Simultaneous Pickup and Delivery (HVRPSPD) is considered to be an NP-hard problem because it generalizes the classical VRP. For its solution, we develop a hybrid local search algorithm in which a non-monotone threshold adjusting strategy is integrated with tabu search. The threshold function used in the algorithm has an adaptive nature which makes it self-tuning. Additionally, its implementation is very simple as it requires no parameter tuning except for the tabu list length. The proposed algorithm is applied to a set of randomly generated problem instances. The results indicate that the developed approach can produce efficient and effective solutions.}

The presented article focuses on identifying potential partnerships between companies that produce CO2 and companies that may reuse CO2 as input for their industrial process. A novel methodological framework is presented based on developing generic matrices for CO2 sources and receivers and matching the industrial units based on geographical and technical criteria. Moreover, the paper provides the technical requirements of 17 CO2 utilization technologies with relatively high technology readiness level, including the CO2-to-product ratio, the required purity, pressure, temperature and the presence of a catalyst, as well as potential synergies and additional requirements. The methodology has been applied to the Västra Götaland region in West Sweden and the most promising CCU symbioses have been identified. These include mineral carbonation (annual uptake: 59,600 tCO2), greenhouses (26,000 tCO2), algae production, methanol production (85,500 tCO2), power to gas (66,500 tCO2), pH control, lignin production, polymers synthesis and concrete curing (96,000 tCO2).

The performance of a warehouse with vertical lift modules is highly correlated with the efficiency of the order picking. Order batching, namely regrouping customers’ orders into batches to be collected from the module, constitutes a critical decision impacting the picking efficiency. In this paper, we provide optimization models for order batching, with the objective of minimizing total completion time, that is, the time required to collect a given set of customers’ orders. We first consider the case of one vertical lift module and then extend our approach to study a warehouse with several modules. We use real data from two companies operating in different sectors in order to test and validate our models. Numerical experiments show that our models perform much better than the batching method currently used by these companies. For complex cases that cannot be solved within a reasonable timeframe with Cplex, we develop a metaheuristic approach, which generally yields very good solutions in less than one minute. This paper investigates problems that are firmly grounded in practice. Our batching models and metaheuristic approach have been implemented in practice and are currently used by some companies.}

We propose a sequential solution heuristic to solve the joint problem of resource pooling, inventory allocation, and capacity level designation of the repair shop with stochastic failure and repair time of repairables. The pooling strategies to obtain repair shop clusters/cells are handled by a K-median algorithm by taking into account the repair time and the holding cost of each repairable spare part. We find that the decomposition of the repair shop in sub-systems by clustering reduces the complexity of the problem and enables the use of queue-theoretical approximations to optimize the inventory and capacity levels. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is analyzed with several numerical experiments. The repair shop designs suggested by the approach provide around 10% and 30% cost reductions on an average when compared to fully flexible and totally dedicated designs, respectively. We also explore the impact of several input parameters and different clustering rules on the performance of the methodology and provide managerial insights.}

We develop a mixed integer program for this situation. Two case studies based on Hurricane Sandy in New Jersey are developed and solved in CPLEX. As expected, increasing equity increases cost and also tends to place generators to stations with large initial inventories. It is further observed that CPLEX can solve the largest instances of the problem for a 5% tolerance gap, indicating that the model is efficient.}

The repair crew problem is one of these efforts, and it is used for deciding ways to manage repairs to destroyed roads that connect members of supply chain networks. Especially in rural areas where road networks are sparse and supply chains are limited, road-network repair is particularly important because road destruction can contribute to high rates of rural isolation. In addition, the unpredictable nature of disasters creates concerns for those effecting post-disaster management. Especially in the short-term after a disaster, damage characteristics can dramatically change. Therefore, we considered a repair crew problem in which aspects of damage vary at certain times. A mathematical formulation on the basis of mixed integer programming is introduced to minimize the weighted sum of total damages caused in isolated areas and completion time of a repair crew. To overcome the complexity issue, an ant colony system algorithm was developed. It can be used to solve a multiple repair crew problem. Our study gives new insights into ways to manage problems in the post-disaster period.}

As a part of the initiative to improve local air quality, cities encourage the adoption of EVs in mass transit system, in particular taxicabs. Motivated by the above, we study a fleet environment, like taxicabs, and build a model that captures the factors influencing EV adoption. We consider a vertically-integrated entity that is a combination of a taxicab company and an infrastructure service provider. We model the entity’s decision-making problem that includes (i) fleet renewal using either internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEs) or EVs; and (ii) infrastructure planning corresponding to investing in fast chargers, and swap stations with stocked EV batteries. We characterize EV adoption in terms of problem parameters such as the mean and coefficient of variation of miles driven. We find that the adoption decision can switch between adopt and do not adopt and vice versa as the mean miles increases. EVs may be adopted at higher variability in miles driven even when they are not adopted at lower variability. To address the operational characteristics of taxicabs to a greater extent, we relax key model assumptions and find that the above conclusions based on the mean and coefficient of variation of miles driven remain valid. This research has practical implications on the attractiveness (or lack thereof) of EV taxicabs / swap stations and on the impact of various government or R&D improvement actions on EV adoption.}

In its deterministic form, the problem aims at selecting a subset of the suppliers and the relative purchasing plan satisfying the demands at minimum cost, taking into account that the suppliers offer discounts based on the total quantity of products purchased and that the activation of a business activity with a supplier has a fixed cost. However, due to the long-term nature of the problem, several parameters may be affected by uncertainty. Thus, we propose a two-stage stochastic programming formulation with recourse, highlighting the strategic and the operational decisions involved, as well as the effect of the different sources of uncertainty. In particular, we focus on the cases in which only the products price or only the products demand are stochastic. The general model and the recourse actions are adapted for these special cases, and the resulting modeling approaches are validated on a large set of instances. The experiments show the convenience of having in place models considering uncertainty explicitly with respect to using expected values for approximating it, and give rise to interesting managerial insights. Due to the computational burden of solving the resulting stochastic models (for a sufficiently large number of scenarios), we also propose a branch-and-cut solution framework based on valid inequalities and other accelerating mechanisms.}

abstract = {We consider a multi-item newsvendor problem with side constraints and common continuous demand distributions that are bounded implying that the items’ profit functions are nondifferentiable. In particular we focus on the cases of uniform and triangular distributions. These distributions naturally describe demand that is guaranteed to exceed a certain threshold – for example, consumption of basic food products or electric power consumption over any given day. Moreover, in practice, it is often difficult to estimate the demand distribution. Accordingly, the uniform and triangular distributions become default modeling choices when only information regarding the bounds and possibly the mode of the distribution is known. We generalize a previous quadratic programming model for uniformly distributed demand on [a,b] to allow a to be nonzero and to allow the order quantity to be smaller than a. We study the corrected model and propose an efficient algorithm for determining an optimal solution. The algorithm is motivated by a structural result of an upper bound on the number of guaranteed shortage products, which typically appear in multiproduct settings with a positive demand distribution lower bound. The performance of our specialized algorithm is compared to that achieved when solving our formulation with a piecewise quadratic objective using a state-of-the-art standard solver. We also extend the modeling technique to propose a nonlinear programming formulation for triangular demand distributions. A similar approach can be adopted to approximate other demand distributions with a possibly non-finite support, such as truncated normal with strictly positive lower bounds.}

In this paper, we study the time-dependent vehicle routing & scheduling problem with CO2 emissions optimization (TD-VRSP-CO2) and develop an exact dynamic programming algorithm to determine the optimal vehicle schedules for given vehicle routes. A hybrid solution approach that combines a genetic algorithm with the exact dynamic programming procedure (GA-DP) is proposed as an efficient solution approach for the TD-VRSP-CO2. Computational experiments on 30 small-sized instances and 14 large-sized instances are used to study the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed hybrid optimization approach with promising results. Contributions of this study can help road-based delivery companies be ready for a low-carbon economy and also help individual vehicle drivers make better vehicle scheduling plans with lower CO2 emissions and fuel consumption.}

However, companies have realized that significant improvements can occur by exploiting an integrated approach, where various decisions are simultaneously taken into consideration and jointly optimized. Motivated by a real case, in this paper we consider a production–distribution system that deals with location, production, inventory, and distribution decisions. The objective is to minimize total costs while satisfying demands within a delivery time window. To solve the problem sequentially, we exploit several commonly used procedures based on separately solving each part of the problem. The integrated problem is solved both by an exact method and a matheuristic approach. Our extensive computational experiments and analysis compare solution costs obtained from the two approaches, highlight the value of an integrated approach, and provide interesting managerial insights into the benefits of integration.}

This system created a division of labor between the informal sector and formal recycling plants by providing a subsidy to the latter to buy waste products collected by the former. Using provincial data of formal e-waste recycling plants in China in 2014, this paper quantifies the contribution of the informal sector to e-waste transportation at the national level. Despite the intention to plan a regional self-sufficient system for e-waste recycling at the provincial level, we find that significant interprovincial flows exist due to the complex market transactions within the informal collection network, which reveals the deep conflicts between market mechanism and public intervention in the evolvement of e-waste governance structure. We built a spatial interaction model to depict the interregional flows of e-waste that can quantitatively illustrate the change of spatial pattern of this network due to the introduction of the formal WEEE regulation in China. In conclusion, we discuss the policy implications for optimizing regional allocation of the e-waste recycling capacity as well as for improving the transparency of the reverse logistic system to include the informal sector in the future.}

The relationships between Supply Chain Management (SCM) and ICs have been imperfectly mathematically investigated, in spite of their intrinsic correlation. To bridge this gap, a bi-objective multi-echelon supply-distribution model is firstly proposed in this paper to optimize collaborations of different echelons. The considered problem is then solved using a recently introduced metaheuristic algorithm, the intelligent water drops (IWD) algorithm in terms of a multi-objective approach. The IWD is then compared with two well-known algorithms, reference-point based non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-III) and non-dominated ranking genetic algorithm (NRGA). The two considered objectives are 1) minimizing the total incurred logistics costs, and 2) maximizing the service level of customers. The small-and-medium sized enterprises (SMEs) positioned in IC as manufacturers profit from using a 3PL-managed supply-demand hub in industrial cluster (SDHIC) as a public provider of warehousing and logistics services. The validity of the proposed approach is illustrated through experimental results including comprehensive statistical analysis on the three used measurement metrics.}

abstract = {The presence of a developed and visible risk management11Here and further, “risk management” refers to the term used by practitioners and in practice-oriented literature. “Risk governance” is considered as a rather academic term so far. (RM) and/or risk governance (RG) system has been highly institutionalised and discoursed in all kinds of modern activities. Based on the case of an oil-producing company operating in the Russian Arctic, the purpose of this paper is to challenge the organising (everything) capability of the risk concept showing that RM may exist between the everything-nothing extremums. By advocating the practice-based approach to organisational RG, the paper studies how the concepts of risk are used (or not used) in handling hazardous activities among different groups of professionals in a nature-exposed context. When following the mainstream of research on risk in the extreme conditions of the Arctic context one would expect the “risk” concept to be present in all practices throughout the company. However, the findings indicate that—apart from practices aimed at building the public sector of the company—the majority of practices carried out daily amid the challenges of the Arctic context do not even allow “risk” into their vocabulary. Instead, due to deeply inherited tacit knowledge of the context and intense entwinement of practices, their uncertainties are seasonally predictable and expected. As a result, RG within the company includes a range of various risk-displacing practices rather than an all-encompassing RM system.}

Given the input data tainted with epistemic uncertainty, two novel possibilistic models are developed to support the bidders and the auctioneer who is a coordinating platform (CP), regarding the bid construction and bid evaluation, respectively. First, using the bid construction model, competing suppliers determine their suggestions regarding the unit prices, quantities, and delivery times of relief items as well as the most appropriate transportation modes. Afterwards, the CP runs the bid evaluation model to assess the submitted bids by which the best portfolio of suppliers and their allocated orders are determined. An illustrative numerical example inspired by a real practice is provided to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed decision models. Several sensitivity analyses are also conducted on key parameters from which useful managerial insights are drawn.}

Thus, this paper aims to develop a stakeholder management model that embraces the visual representation of stakeholder management concepts covering all of the stakeholders involved in DHO and that addresses the current lack of a common understanding of the inter-relationships as well as a common vocabulary and its meanings related to the stakeholders' management in DHO. A systematic literature review is conducted, and after analyzing 326 abstracts and 174 full papers gathered from the Scopus database, 41 stakeholder models are identified in 28 papers. Then, the stakeholder nomenclature and definitions considered in the existing stakeholder models are analyzed to identify the main stakeholders of DHO. Next, stakeholder management concepts are linked to their respective visual representations based on an analysis of how these concepts are conveyed in these stakeholder models for DHO. As a result, this paper presents a new stakeholder model for DHO consistent with the main stakeholders and visual representation of the stakeholder management concepts, named the Public-Private-People Stakeholder Model for DHO, which can also be adjusted to fit different humanitarian and disaster scenarios. Finally, a research agenda is provided to enhance the conceptual foundations of stakeholder management in disaster and humanitarian contexts toward the formalization and improvement of the field for DHO.}

The relevant parameters are generally assumed as deterministic, although such a situation is characterized by uniqueness and is subject to many uncertainties. We thus take uncertainties with respect to street capacities into account and introduce the aspect of resilience in the context of evacuation planning. This resilience aspect is implemented by utilizing the available street capacities in a more balanced way. For balancing the utilization of the street capacities, we accept a predetermined increase in the minimum hazard level. We present a new bi-objective path-based evacuation model based on the assumptions of the Cell-Transmission Model (CTM). We deal with the two conflicting objective functions by applying the ϵ-Constraint Method. Furthermore, we present a special path algorithm that generates the evacuation path in line with our special requirements. We verify the meaningfulness of our proposed idea of resilient evacuation planning in a computational study. Additionally, the study shows some interesting revelations e.g., the more street capacities are blocked, the greater the benefit of the new approach.}

Urban freight transportation makes up a very small percentage of the total transportation time for goods, but it can represent up to 28% of total transportation costs. To reduce overall costs and increase revenue from this operation, one common methodology used by decision makers is the optimization models. This paper proposes a new methodology for evaluating the effectiveness of urban freight transportation systems using the OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness) metric, a well-known rate used in the Lean Manufacturing framework. The methodology uses a mathematical model with several objective functions, two of which are multi-objective, to explore the relationships and trade-offs between economic development, quality, performance and availability (partial rates of the OEE). The final objective is to optimize the OEE metrics and the profitability of a transportation system. This methodology was tested using real-data from the city of Bogotá, Colombia. Experiments were run with different companies, costs, demands and travel times in order to validate the proposed approach. The results show the benefits of using multi-objective functions to optimize both OEE (quality, performance and availability metrics) and profits. The proposed methodology provides an ‘ex ante’ evaluation of the tactical and operational decisions made by companies in configuring an urban freight transport system.}

A hybrid discrete/continuous flow shop supply chain with job shop processes at each supplier stage is studied. For this purpose, the developed scheduling model comprises operations control (for customer order fulfillment dynamics), channel control (production machine and transportation dynamics), resource control (material supply dynamics), and flow control (processing and shipment dynamics) with multiple objectives. Based on the scheduling model, we introduce a robust analysis of schedule coordination in the presence of disruptions in capacities and supply. The application of attainable sets opens a possibility to analyse schedule coordination dynamics under disruptions. The results provide insights of how to integrate the coordination issues into schedule robustness analysis. We exemplify the developed approach for the case of two-stage supply chain coordination, and derive managerial insights for both considered scheduling problem and application of dynamic control methods to supply chain coordination in general.}

The cost objective includes investment, operational, as well as emissions costs. The environmental objective captures emission quantities and waste generation at each link of the supply chain. The social objective considers employment opportunities, prioritizing societal community development and improved labor conditions. To solve the proposed model we employ both goal programming and the ε-constraint method to achieve efficient trade-offs among the three objectives. We have successfully applied the proposed model to a large case study of a global manufacturer. The goal programming method results in both economic and environmental cost improvements, while maintaining social costs under control. The ε-constraint method provides the opportunity to regulate the expenditures related to environmental and social strategies. Despite its high complexity, the case study results validate the ability of the proposed model and method to (re)design high performing sustainable supply chains.}

abstract = {Sustainable Jet Fuel (SJF) represents an important component of the airline industry's strategy to simultaneously reduce GHG emissions while meeting a growing demand for international air travel. SJFs also have the potential to provide fuel supply diversification and security, enhance fuel price stability and provide regional/rural economic development benefits. This paper measures and ranks perceived drivers and barriers to an economically viable SJF industry in a unique U.S. region, the U.S. Pacific Northwest (PNW), through personal interviews with key aviation fuel supply chain stakeholders conducted from June to September 2015. In addition to providing a fertile arena for this first effort to systematically assess these drivers and barriers, the U.S. PNW is unique due to the region's long strategic focus on aviation innovation and its importance to the regional economy, the seminal efforts in the region to outline a path forward on SJF beginning in 2010, and the relatively small population spread over a large geographic area with a limited number of “hub” airport nodes which geographically concentrates aviation fuel demand and distribution. Nineteen stakeholder interviewees acknowledge that, in order for regional SJF adoption-diffusion to occur, airline jet fuel buyers must drive the process, particularly as they deal with greenhouse gas (GHG) emission issues and related policy considerations. Important perceived barriers to SJF industry scale-up in the U.S. PNW include the high production costs of SJF and related issues, such as fuel logistics and quality control in the transport, storage, and blending of SJFs. Perceptions around chain-of-custody issues, such as blending, tracking, and crediting of SJFs and future SJF market share projections for the year 2030 were also examined. Incorporating stakeholder input into discussions about adding blended SJF into the U.S. aviation fuel supply provides needed insight for the biofuels industry, policymakers, and researchers.}

The model integrates economic, environmental and social objectives to support strategic decisions such as facility location, material flow design and transport selection. The environmental impact objective is calculated through the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology using the Eco-indicator 99 method. A multi-criteria programming approach algorithm to manage several objectives linked with stochastic programming to address uncertainty is developed in this investigation. In addition, to assess the solutions obtained and to reduce the uncertainty effect on decision-making, a performance indicator is proposed. Model feasibility has been tested in Cuba. In this case study, the redesign of a supply chain for plastic recycling is examined. The experimental results show supply chain configurations that improve sustainability performance.}

The problem has some features of the integrated production and distribution scheduling problem in that we seek to determine the fleet size and the trucks’ routes subject to a planning horizon constraint. In particular, this research differs because the product has a limited lifetime, the total demand must be satisfied within a planning horizon, multiple trucks can be used, and the production schedule and the distribution sequence are considered. A mixed integer programming model is formulated to solve the problem and, then, heuristics based on evolutionary algorithms are provided to resolve the models.}

The impact of individual differences in picking skills on performance has received little attention. In this paper, we show that we are able to improve state-of-the-art batching and routing methods by almost 10% taking skill differences among pickers into account in minimizing the sum of total order processing time. Compared to assigning order batches to pickers only based on individual picker productivity, savings of 6% in total time are achieved. The increase in picker productivity depends on the picker category, but values of over 16% are observed for some categories. We demonstrate this for the case of a Finnish retailer. First, using time-stamped picking data, multilevel modeling is used to forecast batch execution times for individual pickers by modeling individual skills of pickers. Next, these forecasts are used to minimize total batch execution time, by assigning the right picker to the right order batch. We formulate the problem as a joint order batching and generalized assignment model, and solve it with an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search algorithm.}

The global objective is to minimize the sum of the weights of those jobs that are completed after their due dates. We derive a set of properties that is equivalent to the well known condition of cycle monotonicity, which is a general condition for truthful mechanisms in non-convex valuation function domains. Our results utilize knowledge about the underlying scheduling problem, so that the resulting properties are easier to implement and verify than the general condition of cycle monotonicity.

In this paper, we consider a parcel delivery company interested in optimizing the rate of successful deliveries. By doing so, the company is able to offer a differentiated service, increasing customer satisfaction, and reducing the costs related to failed delivery attempts. In order to achieve this, routes must be designed in a way that visiting times are convenient for the customers. Revisits to some customers may also be planned, so that the expected number of successful deliveries increases. We propose availability profiles to represent the availability of customers during the delivery period. Using these profiles, we are able to compute the expected number of successful hits in a given route. We model the delivery problem as a set-partitioning problem, and solve it with a branch-and-price algorithm. The corresponding pricing problem is solved with a labeling procedure, in which reduced cost bounds are employed to discard unpromising partial routes. We show that the reduced cost of route extensions is bounded by the optimal solution to an orienteering problem, and efficiently compute bounds for that problem within the labeling procedure. Computational experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach for solving instances with up to 100 customers. A tradeoff analysis suggests that significant hit rate improvement can be achieved at the expense of small additional transportation cost. The results also indicate that flexibility regarding maximum route duration translates into an improved hit rate, and that planning revisits may reduce expected unsuccessful deliveries by more than 10%.}

They replace a complex Resource-Task Network (RTN) superstructure from our previous work, leading to smaller problem sizes and orders of magnitude faster computational times. Compared to a closely-related batch-centric formulation, it has the advantage of having a single tuning parameter, which is reflected in the ability to reduce the makespan for one benchmark problem by 7.2%.}

The ‘Portuguese range’ comprises a set of ports located in the west coast of the Iberian Peninsula, grouped in a multi-port gateway region, directly connected to one of the main European Union rail freight corridors. These ports possess a natural competitive advantage as a gateway to foreland regions along the Atlantic Ocean, such as Latin America, North America and West Africa. In order to fully realize this potential, the entire range is engaged in a regionalization process into certain regions of Spain, which is analysed in this paper. The paper builds upon previous work on regionalization, inland terminal networks, dry port development and dyad formations and applies these concepts to the Portuguese range, in its pursue for the capture of hinterlands in Spain. The validity of the regionalization theoretical framework is thus benchmarked against a trans-national case and novel elements are sought to enrich the framework. The paper first describes the current situation of container terminals in the Portuguese range regarding throughput, rail connections, network of inland terminals (and dry ports) and its utilization. Comparison is made with its Spanish counterparts. The policies of major stakeholders are also reviewed concerning dry port and logistic platform development. A number of potential and existing seaport-dry port dyads are identified. Conclusions and policy suggestions are presented.}

In this setting, we aim at a synchronization between the batches of picking orders concurrently assembled and the sequence of SKUs moved along the line, such that the number of line passings to be accomplished by the picker is minimized.

Strategic corporate social responsibility (CSR) involves the voluntary practice of social and environment activities to satisfy firms’ stakeholders, with the intention of generating profits. Companies, especially those within the shipping industry, often face challenges when implementing strategic CSR. The paper therefore, seeks to identify, rank, and discuss the barriers to the implementation of strategic CSR in shipping. A list of barriers was first identified from reviewing the literature. Subsequently, a survey was administered to 600 shipping companies in Singapore and the collected data were analysed using structural equation modelling. The results showed that factors relating to lack of resources, lack of strategic vision, lack of measurement system, high regulatory standards, and low willingness to pay for CSR are significant barriers to implementing strategic CSR in shipping. The findings imply that the practice of strategic CSR is contingent on both the firm's macro-environment and micro-environment, albeit to a lesser extent. Understanding these potential barriers can help companies avoid or overcome these barriers and improve their chances of successfully implementing strategic CSR.}

This paper discusses an interactive decision making problem between a Supply Hub in Industrial Park (SHIP) and its member enterprises in transportation service sharing. This problem is modeled as a bilevel program with the SHIP as the leader and manufacturers as followers. The optimal characteristics of the proposed model are analysed, and an algorithm is developed to solve the model. For comparison, a bilevel analytical model is constructed for the problem with direct transportation service. A numerical study is conducted to examine the influence of major parameters and evaluate the value of sharing transportation service. The results show that SHIP׳s profit will not always increase with the vehicle capacity. Contrary to intuition, manufacturers are found to keep their replenishment and delivery schedules constant when their holding cost rates are high. Compared with direct transportation, SHIP offers a lower delivery price and more frequent delivery service under shared transportation. Sharing transportation service could bring benefits to both SHIP and manufacturers.}

Wholesalers purchase and store these products in a well-controlled environment in the harvest season, and then retrieve select amounts to sell in the market. The amount to purchase in the harvest season as well as how much to retrieve for each selling period strongly impact the profit for a wholesaler. This paper addresses the decisions for optimal purchase and inventory retrieval quantities for a perishable seasonal agricultural product considering the costs of storage, underage and overage, prospects of future prices and demands, and product deterioration. Specifically, we consider a single-product finite-period inventory model in which a wholesaler purchases the product in the first period and sells it in the subsequent periods where the prices fluctuate and are uncertain. The demands are influenced by the prices in the current and previous periods. The objective is to maximize the total expected profit. We characterize the structure of the optimal purchase and inventory retrieval policies, and perform numerical experiments to study sensitivity to various parameters and gain managerial insights. We also compare the performance of the optimal policy with two approximate policies in a case study to demonstrate the value of our model. The results show that the optimal policy can raise the expected profit by 22.4 percent in 2014 and reduce the expected loss by 10.2 percent in 2015 in the case.}

To avoid an excessive movement of gantry cranes when transferring a container from one train to another, modern yards apply sorting systems where shuttle cars move containers horizontally along the spread of the yard. This paper compares four elementary sorting systems. Specifically, we compare rubber-tired and rail-mounted shuttles and differentiate whether a pure shuttle system or a lift & shuttle system is applied. In pure shuttle systems, a shuttle receives a container from a crane and transports it towards the destination crane, where it serves as a storage device until being unloaded. A lift & shuttle system applies shuttles with an integrated lifting platform, so that they are able to autonomously store and receive containers from a separate storage rack. Both alternatives exist in rubber-tired and rail-mounted versions. As the shuttles are the main driver of the investment costs, we compare the required fleet size for timely supplying given gantry crane schedules within all four systems. For this purpose, we derive suited scheduling procedures. This way, decision support for yard managers having to identify a suited sorting system and to layout a new terminal is provided.}

abstract = {Road freight transportation is a pillar of the modern economy. Despite the increasing competition, over 20% of all vehicles run empty on European roads. As a remedy, freight exchanges have been established to bridge such supply-demand imbalances, with the largest markets trading over 200,000 daily offers. Carriers searching for profit-maximizing freights on such markets face a Profit-Maximizing Pickup and Delivery Selection Problem (PPDSP) that has not yet been addressed in previous research. In this paper, we develop a novel graph search that branches on feasible routes for an exact solution and, based on this, we develop a randomized search heuristic for the single vehicle case, a greedy heuristic for the multi-vehicle case, and a Maximum Set Packing formulation for the case of homogeneous and heterogeneous fleets. Computational experiments show that most instances of the various setups can be solved optimally and much faster than the solution offered by the Gurobi optimizer. Both heuristics are highly efficient and the problem of fleets can be solved almost as quickly as the single vehicle case.}

abstract = {This paper investigates the potential for off-hour deliveries in the city of Rome. It focuses on retailers that play a fundamental role in the decision making process often determining delivery times. It explores their preferences for three off-hour delivery prototypes and inquires retailers' willingness to adopt them, both with and without the provision of dedicated incentives. Finally, it analyses retailers’ reactions to a hypothetical scenario where a mandatory off-hour delivery policy is imposed. The overall results show a good inclination towards off-hour deliveries. This induces optimism with respect to their potential introduction as well as skepticism about the lack of attention local decision makers have, so far, paid to this policy option.}

abstract = {This paper focuses on the problem of minimizing CO2 emissions in the routing of vehicles in urban areas. While many authors have realized the importance of speed in minimizing emissions, most of the existing literature assumes that vehicles can travel at the emissions-minimizing speed on each arc in the road network. In urban areas, vehicles must travel at the speed of traffic, which is variable and time-dependent. The best routes also depend on the vehicle load. To solve the problem, we take advantage of previous work that transforms the stochastic shortest path subproblems into deterministic problems. While in general, these paths must be computed for each combination of start time and load, we introduce a result that identifies when the emissions-minimizing path between customers is the same for all loads. When this occurs, we can precompute the paths and store them in a lookup table which saves on runtime. To solve the routing problem, we adapt an existing tabu search algorithm. We test our approach on instances from a real road network dataset and 230 million speed observations. Experiments with different numbers of vehicles, vehicle weights, and pickup quantities demonstrate the value of our approach. We show that large savings in emissions can occur particularly in the suburbs, with heavier vehicles, and with heterogeneous pickup quantities as compared with routes created with more traditional objectives. We show that the savings in emissions are proportionally larger than the associated increases in duration, indicating improved emissions are achievable at a fairly low cost.}

abstract = {One of many approaches to react to the challenges faced by urban freight can be the introduction of electric cargo bikes as an environmentally friendly mode of transport for courier deliveries. Since this market consists of highly decentralized decision-making structures, it is important to characterize the individuals involved and their perceptions in order to estimate market potentials and identify barriers to market uptake. To achieve this goal, we use information from a nationwide survey to draw a picture of the messengers involved as well as to model a binary decision of innovation rejection. The results indicate a group of people close to the general population but with certain particularities regarding gender, education and work style. Their attitudes towards technology are rather positive but their actual adoption of electric cargo bikes shows a much more heterogeneous pattern based on socio-demographics, job circumstances and personal characteristics.}

abstract = {In many rail networks, infrastructure constraints force the shared usage of lines between passenger and freight movements. Scheduling additional freight movements around existing passenger services and peak traffic based curfews presents significant challenges to commodity industries eager to increase export volumes. This paper addresses the problem of inserting additional freight movements in a constrained railway network. To this end, a railway operations planning model was developed to simulate and insert feasible rail movements in a non-periodic timetable. The simulation modelling platform developed in this paper is called RailNet, which simulates the existing railway network constraints and is capable of adding freight paths for planning and scheduling. The timetable for passenger trains is kept unchanged. The paper also reports a real case study in which RailNet was used to quantify the capacity of the track network at the Port Kembla Coal Terminal in New South Wales, Australia under different scenarios of infrastructure upgrades.}

First, the methodological framework of the shopping trip chain estimation is proposed, i.e. generation, catchment distribution and distance estimation. Then, the proposed zonal freight trip generation model is described and a land use module based on attractiveness and accessibility indicators proposed. An application to the deployment of a set of new retailing poles in Lyon, France, is also presented. Results show that although freight trips remain residual at a global level, shopping trip increase of those three new zones have a non-negligible contribution to the overall traffic. Finally, practical implications and further developments are presented.}

abstract = {In this paper, we study the joint optimization of the tactical berth allocation and the tactical yard allocation in container terminals, which typically consist of berth side and yard side operations. The studied two objectives are: (i) the minimization of the violation of the vessels’ expected turnaround time windows with the purpose of meeting the timetables published by shipping liners, and (ii) the minimization of the total yard transportation distance with the aim to lower terminal operational cost. We propose a bi-objective integer program which can comprehensively address the import, export and transshipment tasks in port daily practice. Traditionally, a container transshipment task is performed as a couple of import and export tasks, called indirect-transshipment mode, in which the transit container are needed to be temporally stored in the yard. As the way of transferring containers directly from the incoming vessel to the outgoing vessel, called direct-transshipment mode, has potential to save yard storage resources, the proposed model also incorporates both indirect- and direct-transshipment modes. To produce Pareto solutions efficiently, we devise heuristic approaches. Numerical experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the approaches.}
