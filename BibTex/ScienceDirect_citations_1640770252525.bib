abstract = {The promising characteristics of the 7.2-h radiohalogen 211At have long been recognized; including having chemical properties suitable for labeling targeting vectors ranging from small organic molecules to proteins, and the emission of only one α-particle per decay, providing greater control over off-target effects. Unfortunately, the impact of 211At within the targeted α-particle therapy domain has been constrained by its limited availability. Paradoxically, the most commonly used production method – via the 209Bi(α,2n)211At reaction – utilizes a widely available natural material (bismuth) as the target and straightforward cyclotron irradiation methodology. On the other hand, the most significant impediment to widespread 211At availability is the need for an accelerator capable of generating ≥28 MeV α-particles with sufficient beam intensities to make clinically relevant levels of 211At. In this review, current methodologies for the production and purification of 211At – both by the direct production route noted above and via a 211Rn generator system – will be discussed. The capabilities of cyclotrons that currently produce 211At will be summarized and the characteristics of other accelerators that could be utilized for this purpose will be described. Finally, the logistics of networks, both academic and commercial, for facilitating 211At distribution to locations remote from production sites will be addressed.}

Although automation and assistance technologies are becoming more prevalent in production and logistics, there is consensus that humans will remain an essential part of operations systems. Nevertheless, human factors are still underrepresented in this research stream resulting in an important research and application gap. This article first exposes this gap by presenting the results of a focused content analysis of earlier research on Industry 4.0. To contribute to closing this gap, it then develops a conceptual framework that integrates several key concepts from the human factors engineering discipline that are important in the context of Industry 4.0 and that should thus be considered in future research in this area. The framework can be used in research and development to systematically consider human factors in Industry 4.0 designs and implementations. This enables the analysis of changing demands for humans in Industry 4.0 environments and contributes towards a successful digital transformation that avoid the pitfalls of innovation performed without attention to human factors. The paper concludes with highlighting future research directions on human factors in Industry 4.0 as well as managerial implications for successful applications in practice.}

Having a more complete picture of these aspects by the agents, this paper also sheds light on corporate social responsibility (CSR) in urban freight transport (UFT). A survey was developed with each agent. Factor analysis is used to find the factors for implementation of a UDC and the Structural Equivalence by Orthogonal Procrustes Rotation is used to compare the factors. The findings reveal different points of view for these agents. Residents attached greater importance to factors related to habitability and sustainability in the city.

In collaborative networks, backhauling is used to find profitable services in the return trip to the depot and to reduce empty running of vehicles. This work investigates the vertical collaboration between a shipper and a carrier for the planning of integrated inbound and outbound transportation. Based on the hierarchical nature of the relation between the shipper and the carrier and their different goals, the problem is formulated as a bilevel Vehicle Routing Problem with Selective Backhauls (VRPSB). At the upper level, the shipper decides the minimum cost delivery routes and the set of incentives offered to the carrier to perform integrated routes. At the lower level, the carrier decides which incentives are accepted and on which routes the backhaul customers are visited. We devise a mathematical programming formulation for the bilevel VRPSB, where the routing and the pricing problems are optimized simultaneously, and propose an equivalent reformulation to reduce the problem to a single-level VRPSB. The impact of collaboration is evaluated against non-collaborative approaches and two different side payment schemes. The results suggest that our bilevel approach leads to solutions with higher synergy values than the approaches with side payments.}

Increase in negative externalities such as air pollution and road congestion are examples of challenging issues. Consolidation of cargo/container flows may help to alleviate the situation by better utilizing the means of transport and containers. Using analytical models for three scenarios – only-trucking (no-consolidation), container consolidation and combined container/cargo consolidation – we discuss the conditions under which the consolidation of flows can be beneficial. The results imply that shipment distance and type of cargo are important factors that affect the performance of flow consolidation in port-hinterland logistics.}

abstract = {Electrical vehicles (EVs) by the nature of the technology assume a dual role of supplying transportation mobility and storing electric power. Thus, the operations of EV impact both transportation and power grid systems. This study proposes the concept of an “energy sponge” service by de- signing an EV sharing system serving both a transportation system and a power market. The proposed model investigates operations of a fleet of EVs that may opt to serve the transportation system when the transportation demand is high or return electricity to the grid when the power price shoots high. A Markov decision model is proposed to determine the optimal policy on time allocation of the EV fleet over the two systems. A dynamic programming algorithm is developed to solve the model efficiently. Real-world data on the configurations of these two markets are used to build numerical examples. Sensitivity analyses are constructed to draw insights into the benefits and operational patterns of the service. Overall, this model provides methods and insights for EV fleet managers to decide optimal policies for allocating the EV fleet between transportation and power markets. Besides shared mobility systems, this model also has great potential in other logistics and supply chain systems where EVs are used to deliver goods or services.}

Each TC brings its own vision and puts forward trends and issues important and relevant for future research. The analysis is performed on the enterprise-level topics with an interface too other relevant systems (e.g., supply chains). The vision developed might lead to the identification of new scientific control directions such as Industry 4.0 technology-enabled new production strategies that require highly customised supply network control, the creation of resilient enterprise to cope with risks, developments in management decision-support systems for the design, and scheduling and control of resilient and digital manufacturing networks, and collaborative control. Cobots, augmented reality and adaptable workstations are a few examples of how production and logistic systems are changing supporting the operator 4.0. Sustainable manufacturing techniques, such closed-loop supply chains, is another trend in this area. Due to increasing number of elements and systems, complex and heterogeneous enterprise systems need to be considered (e.g., for decision-making). These systems are heterogeneous and build by different stakeholders. To make use of these, an environment is needed that allows the integration of the systems forming a System-of-Systems (SoS). The changing environment requires models which adapt over time. Some of the adaptation is due to learning, other mechanisms include self-organisation by intelligent agents. In general, models and systems need to be modular and support modification and (self-)adaptation. An infrastructure is needed that supports loose coupling and evolving systems of systems. The vision of the overall contribution from the research community in manufacturing and logistics systems, over the next few years is to bring together researchers and practitioners presenting and discussing topics in modern manufacturing modelling, management and control in the emerging field of Industry 4.0-based resilient and innovative production SoS and supply networks.}

The system was designed in two modes of driving by utility electricity or PV array, and was expected to operate continuously via cascade evaporation in the cold storage. The hourly and daily performance was analyzed and compared between the two modes. The results indicate that the system driven by the stable utility electricity obtains the hourly refrigeration and system coefficient of performance (COP) between 1.02–5.73 and 0.85–4.58, respectively. The daily average refrigeration COP is between 2.75 and 3.02, and the daily average system COP is between 2.27 and 2.46; the highest daily cumulative ice mass reaches 178.45 kg. For the system driven by the PV array, the most daily ice mass of 144.10 kg is obtained with the PV capacity of 5.4 kW and the highest cumulative solar insolation of 20.41 MJ/m2, of which the daily refrigeration and system COP are 1.33 and 0.19, respectively. The characteristics of the ice thermal storage gives that the stored ice of 88.5 kg could sustain the cold storage temperature below 5 °C for about 11 h. Results show a positive trend indicating that this system could be a viable alternative for developing chain logistics service.}

While electric passenger cars and their charging strategies are already in series production, battery electric trucks and their charging strategies are still mostly in the prototype stage. The range limitations of battery electric trucks represent a new challenge for logistics. Therefore, we introduce a methodology for determining charging strategies for freight transport vehicles based on transport simulation results. We analyze the results of an agent-based transport simulation (MATSim) and evaluate different settings of normal and fast charging points. We found for a case study dealing with the food retailing in Berlin, that for a fleet with 279 vehicles in 16 depots 214 normal and 61 fast charging points are sufficient to complete approx. 90% of the tours with BEV. If the vehicles share their charging points, only 71 fast charging points with 400 kW are sufficient. With higher charging power the share of charged vehicles hardly increases. With 29 additional high performance opportunity chargers within the city, all tours can be operated by battery electric trucks. Due to the large variance in route lengths, the results of the case study can be representative for the entire delivery traffic.}

This article aims to investigate whether some supply chains were resilient or not and why, using a knowledge-based approach and specifically focusing on the role played by supply chain innovation in building resilience to disruptions, thanks to knowledge preparedness. The study is motivated by two main rationales: the unique situation of a global pandemic and the absence of studies providing grounded evidences of supply chain resilience in a worst-case scenario. The research is based on the assumption that knowledge preparedness introduces logistics/supply chain innovations and enables companies to prevent, detect, and respond to unpredictable negative events. By using a large-scale sample of European firms' data from the Eurostat and a multivariate regression analysis, the authors cross-study the effects of supply chain knowledge preparedness – based on innovation type and expenditures – on the international trade of goods from January to June 2020. The results confirm that the most resilient supply chains were those that had previously introduced innovations, a factor that strengthens the knowledge preparedness of firms when faced with unforeseeable supply chain disruptions.}

Recent data reveal that interleukin-34 (IL-34) can drive inflammatory response, thereby participating in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases. However, the potential effect of IL-34 in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to explore whether the levels of serum IL-34 were correlated with clinical severity or prognosis in AIS patients.
Methods
In this prospective cohort study, serum IL-34 levels were detected in 150 healthy controls and 155 AIS patients. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were conducted to investigate the effect of IL-34 on the diagnosis and prognosis of AIS. ROC curve was utilized to evaluate predictive values for IL-34.
Results
Serum IL-34 levels at admission were significantly higher in AIS patients than those in the healthy controls. Univariate and multivariate logistics regression analysis showed that IL-34 was an independent predictor of occurrence and functional outcome of AIS. The ROC curve demonstrated that IL-34 had a good predictive effect on the diagnosis and prognosis of AIS.
Conclusions
IL-34 can be used as a novel and independent diagnostic and predicting prognostic biomarker in AIS.}

A thorough list of challenges in the implementation of omni-channel systems is generated and a number of propositions on enablers and barriers to omni-channel data integration are recommended. Our findings emphasise the importance of automating and standardising data capturing and sharing methods, and centralising data storage among companies and channels, which lead to improved efficiencies.

abstract = {China, the world’s largest logistics market, is experiencing insatiable demand for logistics services. The boom in China’s e-commerce has led to massive growth in the need for product shipping and warehouse storage. Some of China’s largest retailers have invested tremendous amounts of money in warehouse development. Two important functions of a warehouse are packing and stacking: packing small products into medium-sized containers and stacking the containers on pallets. Often, the packing problem is solved independently from that of stacking or is ignored. Generally, the stacking problem is solved while treating the packing decisions as given. However, considering these two problems separately may result in suboptimal, i.e., less efficient operations. Therefore, we propose a mixed integer linear programming formulation that addresses these two problems as a whole and two relaxations for actual-size examples. Due to the inherent demand uncertainty, we present a two-stage robust model that employs interval-based and scenario-based uncertainty sets. We numerically verify that the integrated model achieves considerable economic benefits and efficient space utilization while exploiting spatial flexibility. The additional computational experiments suggest that two relaxations yield tiny optimality gaps of 0.3% on average (4.6% at maximum), and considerable computation time improvements of 207.9% on average (347.4% at maximum). Our numerical results also illustrate that the scenario-based robust approach outperforms the deterministic approach and interval-based robust approach. We verify the model with varying variability and sizes of containers. The computational results indicate that compared with single type of containers, two or three types would bring significant economic benefits.}

The expected mobility changes, triggered by the introduction of electric mobility, sharing concepts, modern vehicle concepts, new planning approaches and future autonomous vehicle concepts open up new options for an improved efficiency in the corporate mobility sector. The purpose of this article is to review literature between 2016 and mid-2020 on all transport-related activities of corporations and critically review research conclusions and their implication to determine research gaps for potential alternative ways of system transition. This is achieved by a semi-systematic review of international scientific journals and conference papers independently from their research field with a set of a-priori defined terms on corporate mobility and logistics. The article concludes with a summary of major research motivations and outcomes to the mobility transition in companies and identified research gaps with potential added value to the transport system. The review reveals that the major objective of analysed articles is the zero-emission future. An examination of new mobility solutions, technologies, and their potential impact is ongoing. The potentials to design future systems and ways of system transition have yet to be sufficiently examined. The relevant question is how mobility management in corporations could be upgraded. The integration into companies’ strategic management and inter-company mobility concepts could be potential fields. These findings are important for policymakers and mobility managers to jointly work on the zero-emission future.}

The findings illustrate that the implementation of green initiatives is at an early stage in the province, and that Canadian trucking companies face a multitude of drivers and barriers when adopting green initiatives. Overall, there is a high degree of variation among the cases; however, the findings suggest that three different approaches to environmental sustainability (i.e., proactive, reactive, and stagnating) can be observed.

Carbon emission causes ocean acidification, which greatly harms marine lives. In order to respond to these environmental issues, this paper studies marine debris collection with consideration of carbon cap using logistics network. To the most of our knowledge, this is first work to study marine debris removal from logistics way. We proposed a three-phase marine debris collection framework: (1) identifying initial locations of the debris; (2) utilizing GNOME software to predict the drifting trajectory of the debris; and (3) formulating vessel routing as a mixed integer nonlinear programming with consideration of carbon emission. The model seeks to minimize the total costs including fuel cost, berth cost, unloading cost in the harbor, vessel rent, vessel insurance, and labor cost, with respect to the constraints of carbon cap, vessel capacities, and time windows. After the linearization process, a Branch-and-Cut (B&C) algorithm with multiple variable fixing techniques and valid inequalities is used to solve the proposed model. The debris dispersion located in Boston vicinity is used as a case study to validate the proposed model and algorithm. The results reveal that the farther away the debris location is from the shore, the higher the collection cost and the more the carbon emission would be. The daily collection cost in the closest location and in the farthest location is $140 lower and $210 higher than that in the initial location. The carbon emission in the farthest location is 21% and 32% higher than that in the initial location and in the closest location. Sensitivity analysis is also carried out for the fuel price and carbon cap to test their impact on total costs These results show that proposed model and algorithm can significantly improve the efficiency of marine debris collection process, reduce carbon emission and total costs.}

In this paper, the green operations management practices are evaluated by using fuzzy AHP. Additionally, this paper highlights the benefits of green operations management over conventional operations management. To justify the adoption of green operations management practices, the fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) is used for calculating the global desirability index for the green operations management practices and conventional operations management practices and a comparison is carried out between both global desirability indexes to justify the concepts of green operation management in the manufacturing industry. The proposed research is generalized and can be utilized by the managers working in different organizations to rethink and redesign their management policies to harness sustainable profits in the business operations of organizations without affecting the environment adversely.}

Biomass from the crop residue has huge potential for renewable power generation, but it is still not utilized to its full potential. This study presents a comprehensive methodology to evaluate and forecast the current and future availability of selective crop residue to generate renewable energy. A forecast model incorporating historical trends in the crop yield has been developed in MATLAB and implemented for crop residue based biomass resource assessment of five primary crops (wheat straw, rice husk, rice straw, cotton straw, corn stover, and bagasse) in order to estimate the energy generation potential for Pakistan from 2018 till 2035. It was found that about 40 million tonnes of crop residue was available in Pakistan for power generation in the year 2018 considering a residue removal (availability) factor of 50%. This translates to an estimated potential of about 11,000 MW of electricity generation capacity using crop residue derived biomass for 2018. This capacity is predicted to gradually increase up to 16,000 MW by the year 2035 based on the trends in the growth of crop production since 2001. The suitability of a potential region for the installation of 100 MW biomass-fired power plants was also assessed by calculating crop residue density and an equivalent collection radius (Re) of 50 km (km). Punjab province of Pakistan, being an agricultural province, with relatively better road infrastructure can sustain crop residue based power plants of up to 7000 MW cumulative capacity at various locations. The challenges, such as economic, logistics, regulatory and political barriers, in generating renewable energy from biomass along with their potential solutions were also discussed. The study also provides a baseline for future research to evaluate and forecast the growth in bio-power generation potential of any biomass resource in a region based on crop yield and area of the region.}

Coordination of healthcare facilities is one of the emergency medical response strategies to ensure the continued provision of medical services during disasters. Although the existing literature reviews of OR approaches have included the perspective of healthcare management, they focused mostly on the application of OR in disaster operations and logistics management. The importance of coordination in healthcare systems during disasters is well recognised in the literature, but to the best of our knowledge there has been no review of the published research in this area. This study provides a focused literature review of the OR contributions in the coordination in healthcare systems during disasters. Definitions of the terms in use in this field are provided. An overall descriptive statistics of the reviewed articles is given, followed by the review of the presented research problems, disaster types, and developed methodologies. The main characteristics of models for the coordination in the healthcare system are described. Measures of coordination effectiveness that denote healthcare resilience are discussed. Based on our findings, we suggest future research directions in the context of existing models extension, and application and development of other methodologies with the aim to provide a solid basis for OR research in the healthcare disaster management.}

In order to be able to analyze, measure and improve its performance, it is necessary to establish evaluation criteria that take into account not only economic aspects, but also society and the environment. However, this type of evaluation generally uses deterministic data for the performance indicators, distorting the real result of its values and hindering adequate decision-making. Thus, this research aims to propose a probabilistic analysis of container terminals' sustainable performance, taking into account uncertainties that the indicators' values can assume. Methodologically, the study was supported by secondary data collection in nine container terminals, followed by a Gray Relational Analysis and Monte Carlo Simulation. With respect to the case study, it is observed that the indicator “number of jobs generated” is the one that most penalized the sustainable performance of the analyzed terminals, whereas, antagonistically, the “net revenue” had little influence on the sustainability indexes. Also noteworthy is that the generation of performance probability curves for each terminal promoted a more appropriate analysis for decision-making at the corporate and governmental levels.}

This study provides such statistical data and evaluation of traffic on the NSR during 2016–2019 and discusses policy implications for future NSR shipping. The study shows that Russian domestic shipping dominates shipping activities on the NSR in terms of number of shipping companies, vessels and voyages. There are much fewer Asian shipping companies working on the NSR than European companies, contrary to media reports that often depict a large Asian shipping influence on the NSR. Much more frequent voyages are also taking place between the NSR and European ports than ports in the Asian Pacific region.

The variation in heights beyond high altitude has different effects on the cardiorespiratory profile of individuals because of variation in oxygen density with every thousand feet. This study was planned to analyze and compare the effects of difference in altitudes on cardiorespiratory profile from anesthesiologist's point of view.
Methods
A multicenter observational study was done involving two different groups of 600 patients at 10,000 ft (Group A) and 15,000 ft (Group B). Observation and comparison of oxygen saturation, 6-min walk test, and breath holding time was carried out.
Results
Fifty-five percent of subjects in Group A had oxygen saturation of more than 93% in comparison to 5.5% in Group B. This was statistically significant (P < 0.001). Two percent of subjects in Group A in comparison to 63.5% of Group B had oxygen saturation of less than 88% (P < 0.001). Percentage increase of more than 15% of heart rate was found to be statistically significant in all the age groups. Overall, 3.8% of individuals in Group A had breath holding time less than 15 s in comparison to 16.6% of individuals in Group B (P value < 0.001).
Conclusion
The study demonstrates that there is a significant fall in oxygen saturation, significant rise in the heart rate in 6-min walk test, and significant fall in the breath holding time in the group located at 15,000 ft. Heights beyond 10,000 ft should be restricted to life and limb saving surgeries, and logistics should be focused more on “scoop and run” than “stay and play” policy.}

The pretreatment was largely completed during biomass storage, which renders the storage conditions critical. In this study, the effects of storage temperature (−80 °C to 60 °C) and storage time (up to half a year) on the enzymatic digestibility and fermentability of DLC corn stover (CS) were investigated. DLC-CS containing calcium hydroxide(ch) showed increased enzymatic digestibility with increased storage temperature and time. High glucan conversions (>90%) and ethanol titers (e.g. 73.1 g/L) were achieved after regular steam autoclave of DLC(ch)-CS, without washing or detoxification. DLC-CS containing sulfuric acid(sa) was sensitive to storage conditions, and autoclaved DLC(sa)-CS reached the highest ethanol titer (66.6 g/L) when DLC(sa)-CS was stored at room temperature for 14 days. Results indicated that different ambient temperatures in different regions and seasons have a far-reaching impact on DLC-CS for bioconversion.}

In the literature of mining management, both academic scholars and industrial managers are paying more and more attention to develop state-of-the-art mine supply chain management (MSCM) methodologies. To meet this emerging demand, this study aims to conduct a comprehensive and up-to-date literature review on MSCM research topics by evaluating over 200 papers, mostly published in the last decade (2010–2021). We analyse the characteristics of the reviewed papers from perspectives of the mine supply chain's links and the interdisciplinary classification. Thus, we classify these papers into nine main categories, namely, capacity planning, logistics, inventory control, network design, economic issues (e.g., pricing), efficiency evaluation, risk control, environmental protection, and production scheduling. Based on this classification, we present potential research opportunities and managerial insights in the area of MSCM.}

In this regard, the Arctic region is characterized by the following significant features: a) economic: the predominant development of extractive industries, the underdevelopment of transport and logistics infrastructure and the increased level of costs for its operation, as well as technological problems caused by severe natural and climatic conditions; b) environmental: the uniqueness and high vulnerability of the habitat; c) social: the necessity to preserve the authentic lifestyle of Indigenous Peoples of the North (IPN). The current SD challenges in the Arctic are the rapid development of transport as a way to connect the cities in the North, and a special approach to the professional training of workers as the only force for implementing the SD concept.

abstract = {Background
Work-related musculoskeletal disorders are widespread among workers in the weaving industry. The most affected body regions are the neck, shoulders, back, and wrist. The present study attempts to understand risk factors for MSDs in various body region among handloom and power loom weavers.
Method
A cross-sectional household survey was conducted on a sample of 364 weavers during November 2019 to February 2020. The survey instrument for measuring musculoskeletal symptoms was adopted from a standardised Nordic questionnaire. The impact of the occupation of weaving on MSDs was analysed using binary logistics regression.
Results
The 12-month prevalence of MSDs was higher among handloom weavers compared to power loom weavers, particularly in the upper back (84-45%), lower back (82–50%), knee (60–35%), and shoulder (76–42%) respectively. Similar patterns were observed in the 12-month prevalence of MSDs, which prevented regular activity inside or outside the home. Analysis suggests that the occupation of weaving raises the risk of MSDs particularly in the shoulder (OR: 4.52, C.I.: 2.63–7.76), lower (OR: 6.9, C.I.: 3.79–12.54) and upper back (OR: 5.63, C.I.: 3.19–9.95). Older age and long years of working are significant risk factors for MSDs.
Conclusions
The findings suggest a relatively higher prevalence of MSDs among handloom weavers, particularly in the upper back, lower back and shoulder, compared to Powerloom weavers. Preventive measures and treatment to minimise the burden of MSDs among handloom weavers are strongly recommended.}

The core nodes (commercial banks, small and medium-sized enterprises, third-party logistics companies) can coordinate and monitor their behavior with each other, and can achieve mutual benefit and efficient operation of the supply chain. This paper studies the theory of meshless partial differential equations (MPDE), and uses game theory and information economics theories and methods to establish corresponding multiparty game models. The application of this game model to the members of supply chain finance was explored. Mathematical derivation and example analysis prove that the model is reasonable, and it also provides a way to make the supply chain operate most efficiently and maximize the benefits.}

To date, over 18,000 artificial objects and fragments recorded in near-Earth space. Therefore, the issues of cleansing outer space of space debris of various sizes are quite relevant. In this article, the concept of a multirole station is studied. For the successful design of such a station that could serve spacecraft in space and successfully cope with space debris, it is necessary to consider and necessarily take into account in its further work the ballistic aspects of the orbital motion of spacecraft and the logistics of building such a station. This station could be a maintenance hub for satellites or a space debris collector. Because some satellites have very precious instruments onboard, it could be a loose of money to launch a new satellite if the first one is out of service because of a system failure or a lack of fuel. In this perspective, an orbital maintenance hub would enable to fix the failure (batteries replacement, refueling, mechanical maintenance) and to give to the satellites a new life. In this article, we also study the possibility of using such a hub to remove space debris from their orbit and to collect them until they can be deorbiting.}

Today, many pulmonologists and intensivists who can use bedside PDT do not perform this procedure; it is conceivable this practice may expand, especially among pulmonologists and intensivists.

To address this, this study uses the Early Childhood Longitudinal Survey to look descriptively at how school busing might be associated with absenteeism for kindergartners in rural communities. We find that school bus riders in rural communities miss fewer school days on average than those in suburban, urban, or town communities and are less likely to be chronically absent, although this varies depending on the degree of rurality. Rural communities have unique features that are very different from their urban or suburban counterparts and these features should be considered when designing interventions for rural students.}

abstract = {Digital twin (DT) is a virtual mirror (representation) of a physical world or a system along its lifecycle. As for a complex discrete manufacturing system (DMS), it is a digital model for emulating or reproducing the functions or actions of a real manufacturing system by giving the system simulation information or directly driven by a real system with proper connections between the DT model and the real-world system. It is a key building block for smart factory and manufacturing under the Industry 4.0 paradigm. The key research question is how to effectively create a DT model during the design stage of a complex manufacturing system and to make it usable throughout the system’s lifecycle such as the production stage. Given that there are some existing discussions on DT framework development, this paper focuses on the modeling methods for rapidly creating a virtual model and the connection implementation mechanism between a physical world production system at a workshop level and its mirrored virtual model. To reach above goals, in this paper, the discrete event system (DES) modeling theory is applied to the three-dimension DT model. First, for formally representing a manufacturing system and creating its virtual model, seven basic elements: controller, executor, processor, buffer, flowing entity, virtual service node and logistics path of a DMS have been identified and the concept of the logistics path network and the service cell is introduced to uniformly describe a manufacturing system. Second, for implementing interconnection and interaction, a new interconnection and data interaction mechanism between the physical system and its virtual model for through-life applications has been designed. With them, each service cell consists of seven elements and encapsulates input/output information and control logic. All the discrete cells are constructed and mapped onto different production-process-oriented digital manufacturing modules by integrating logical, geometric and data models. As a result, the virtual-physical connection is realized to form a DT model. The proposed virtual modeling method and the associated connection mechanism have been applied to a real-world workshop DT to demonstrate its practicality and usefulness.}

abstract = {The paper deals with the influence of introducing low-emission zones in Europe for technological readiness of road freight transport in the European area. There are efforts on the part of several cities in Europe to introduce regulatory measures for transport, in particular regarding the reduction of exhaust emissions and noise emissions. The current commercial vehicle market offers some solutions reflecting regulatory measures for cities to contribute to meeting global targets to reduce emissions from transport. In the Central European space, however, fleets of carriers operating distribution services are often unprepared for the introduction of regulatory measures in the sense of sustainable mobility requirements. The paper will be published research outputs or vehicle composition currently used in urban logistics supply and city centers is ready for regulatory action.}

To assess how such distortions impact the market, we have developed a Mixed Complementarity Problem model of China's natural gas industry, with a novel representation of price caps associated with supply obligations. The model is used to assess how government pricing policies and restricted third party access to midstream infrastructure impacted the supply logistics of China's profit maximizing natural gas firms in the year 2015. We find that lifting the price caps for regulated natural gas demand sectors could yield a 4.7% (1.4 billion USD) reduction in total system cost and reduce the national average of marginal supply costs by 14%. Improving third party access to the pipeline and regasification infrastructure would result in an additive total cost saving of 7.6% (2.2 billion USD) and a 16% reduction in average prices, due to replacing domestic and imported LNG with pipeline imports. The LNG industry would be negatively affected by the reforms investigated in this study, as market players would gain more flexibility in their logistics and would utilize lower cost supply pathways.}

A survey with 43 items, drawn from the literature, was applied to a convenience sample of Colombian manufacturing companies. The hypotheses, relating to environmentally sustainable practices and environmental collaboration data, were tested using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). The main results show that internal environmental management, eco-design, and green marketing have direct and positive effect on environmental collaboration. However, no relationship was found between green human resources, green information and systems technology, and reverse logistics and environmental collaboration. In addition, the positive effect of environmental collaboration on sustainable production practices, such as green purchasing, green manufacturing, and green distribution, was reflected. The paper expands knowledge of the way in which environmentally practices are related to environmental collaboration and their implications for more sustainable production and consumption.}

In many regions, grassroots initiatives (i.e., community-led bottom-up initiatives) have emerged to experiment with alternative food networks and change the dominant food regimes. While grassroots initiatives can play a crucial role in sustainability transitions, it is known that actors usually face challenges related to (1) building and maintaining an initiative, and (2) diffusing it to the mainstream. However, the systemic mechanisms underlying these two types of challenges in food systems are still underspecified. Building on previous empirical research, the paper uses systems thinking (qualitative causal loop diagrams) to detail (1) the systemic mechanisms underlying the emergence and maintenance of an alternative food network; and (2) the feedback loops related to organizational and logistics issues that pose limits to scaling. It explains the paradox of diffusion in alternative food networks and concludes that diffusion of alternative food networks to mainstream may be achieved through replication and translation strategies, rather than scaling-up.}

The current path finding methods in the industry rely on excessive usage of guidance in the shape of magnets, tapes or QR codes on the floor that the AGVs follow to reach their destinations. However, the current methods lack operational flexibility and are costly to scale in the cases of job-shop floor expansions. In this paper, a dynamic path finding method with obstacle avoidance is presented which utilizes distance measuring sensors to avoid obstacles and reach the goal destination using the most direct path as possible. Tests for functionality and multi-agent scaling have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the dynamic method in a multi-agent setting. The results show that the dynamic method scales properly and is capable of navigating multiple agents through a simulated warehouse environment autonomously and without relying on external guidance. The dynamic method is able to avoid most collisions using distance measuring sensors and multi-agent negotiation to resolve conflicts among the agents that could have resulted in potential collisions. The proposed dynamic method provides a flexible and scalable path finding method for use in Industry 4.0.}

This paper designs a modified C-W algorithm based on the merging of node-inserted paths to achieve the optimization of pickup and delivery problem with time windows (PDPTW). A numerical analysis is conducted to compare the independent distribution mode with the innovative joint distribution mode. The results highlight that the innovative joint distribution mode performs better than the independent distribution mode in both different order sizes and different lengths of O2O time windows, which can improve the delivery efficiency and lower the total costs.}

To reach as we state in this paper as the spotting level of service, into the scheduling operational details and time-step within a time-horizon of planning, the novel aspect of these types of PSE solutions is to integrate automated logistics or blend logistics decisions regarding: (1) sizing the future blend volumes for blending (or throughputs of unit-operations for processing); (2) selecting a product tank for the blends (or modes of operation for the process units); (3) sequencing the blended product grades (i.e., regular before premium, etc.) in multi-product blender (or the sequence of modes of operation for units/tanks); (4) slotting the start-times of the blends (or processing-time of units) into time-periods; and (5) spotting the future product shipments to steward to the plan. Examples of scheduling optimization effectively implemented are: (1) the production of lubes and asphalts with sequence-dependent switchovers between modes of operation; and (2) the gasoline blend scheduling operations using decomposition strategies and cuts based on nominal qualities. Faster results are obtained by tailored solutions of decomposing these industrial problems.}

Preserving air medical evacuation capabilities for critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) required innovation for en route care logistics, training, and equipment. The aim of this study was to describe characteristics and in-flight interventions for patients with suspected COVID-19 requiring air medical evacuation by US Air Force critical care air transport teams (CCATTs).
Methods
We performed a retrospective chart review of patients with suspected COVID-19 requiring air medical evacuation by CCATT from April 2020 to February 2021. We included patients with an available CCATT medical record and transport with COVID-19 infection isolation precautions. CCATT medical records were the data source, and we performed descriptive analyses of patient characteristics and in-flight interventions.
Results
We reviewed 460 records and identified 16 patients for inclusion. The Transport Isolation System (50%) and Negatively Pressurized Conex (31%) were commonly used portable biocontainment units. The median patient age was 48.5 years, and 94% were male. All patients required oxygen supplementation, with 8 (50%) receiving mechanical ventilation. In-flight interventions among intubated patients (n = 8) included vasopressors (50%), paralytics (25%), and patient-ventilator asynchrony management (63%).
Conclusion
Patients with COVID-19 requiring CCATT transport were older than prior military en route care cohorts, and in-flight interventions for patient-ventilator asynchrony were commonly required during mechanical ventilation.}

Factors impacting parents’ selection of interventions for their child on the autism spectrum need to be understood in order to better support decision-making. The aim of the current study was to explore parent-reported influences on decisions.
Method
A sample of 14 Australian parents (13 mothers; 1 father) of a child (4–11 years) diagnosed on the autism spectrum were interviewed about their decisions regarding the use of interventions. A thematic analysis was used to identify prominent themes.
Findings
A total of three themes, comprising 11 subthemes were identified. The primary themes were: finding interventions; meeting child and family needs; and acceptability and access.
Conclusion
Parents’ responses highlighted influences on decisions to use evidence-based practices (e.g., behavioural therapies and social skills programs), as well as those with limited empirical support (e.g., animal-assisted therapy and dietary intervention). Influences frequently reported in extant research were reported by parents in this study (e.g., recommendations, logistics of access, and children’s individual needs) as well as issues that warrant further investigation (e.g., coping with challenges and stress, importance of intervention intensity, and consideration of the whole family).}

abstract = {Summary
Emerging testing technologies for detection of SARS-CoV-2 include those that are rapid and can be used at point-of-care (POC), and those facilitating high throughput laboratory-based testing. Tests designed to be performed at POC (such as antigen tests and molecular assays) have the potential to expedite isolation of infectious patients and their contacts, but most are less sensitive than standard-of-care reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Data on clinical performance of the majority of emerging assays are limited with most evaluations performed on contrived or stored laboratory samples. Further evaluations of these assays are required, particularly when performed at POC on symptomatic and asymptomatic patients and at various time-points after symptom onset. A few studies have so far shown several of these assays have high specificity. However, large prospective evaluations are needed to confirm specificity, particularly before the assays are implemented in low prevalence settings or asymptomatic populations. High throughput laboratory-based testing includes the use of new sample types (e.g., saliva to increase acceptability) or innovative uses of existing technology (e.g., sample pooling). Information detailing population-wide testing strategies for SARS-COV-2 is largely missing from peer-reviewed literature. Logistics and supply chains are key considerations in any plan to ‘scale up’ testing in the Australian context. The strategic use of novel assays will help strike the balance between achieving adequate test numbers without overwhelming laboratory capacity. To protect testing of high-risk populations, the aims of testing with respect to the phase of the pandemic must be considered.}

In this study, industrial pellets and laboratory-made pellets produced at different die temperatures (90, 125 °C) from wheat straw, beech, and pine were pretreated (by dilute acid and alkali) and enzymatically hydrolyzed to study the effects of pelleting on pretreatment and sugar yield. The results showed that industrial pelleting positively affected sugar yield of the three biomasses for both acid and alkaline pretreatments, while laboratory pelleting affected sugar yield differently related to pretreatment types and biomass species. Pelleting disturbed biomass cell wall structure and affected the stability of hemicellulose and β-O-4′ linkages in lignin. The extent of hemicellulose solubility during acid pretreatment and the amount of lignin β-O-4′ ether linkages present in acid pretreated substrates could serve as indicators of the effect of pelleting on sugar yield. The structural modifications caused by pelleting and their effects on the enzymatic sugar yield correlate tightly to pelleting technology, pretreatment method, and biomass species. The discrepant effects between industrial and laboratory pelleting on sugar yield observed in this study should be considered when designing future studies.}

abstract = {Over the past half-century, manufacturers have strived to achieve “Zero Inventory (ZI)” manufacturing, which puts the burden on suppliers to build their warehouses nearby production lines to meet the strict time delivery requirements of ZI production. Considerable improvements in manufacturing processes have been made. However, this practice in the meanwhile brings excessive warehousing operations along the supply chain. Recently, massive up-front investment has been made by some larger manufacturers for industrial 4.0 and warehouse automation to facilitate warehousing operations, such as put away and picking. However, warehouse operation activities enhanced by automation are still non-value-adding and current practice of redundant handling process implies continuous cost increase with the demand expanding. Therefore, it is of significance to simplify the corresponding operations as much as possible. This paper makes a comprehensive introduction to a new manufacturing paradigm named Zero-Warehousing Smart Manufacturing (ZWSM) from the concept, practices, principles, and core technologies. ZWSM basically aims to avoid traditional non-value-adding warehousing operations such as put away and order picking, as well as to reduce the warehousing space for operations to the minimum. First, prototype layout and basic practices under ZWSM are proposed. Second, synchronization, unitization and uncertainty hedging, which are the key principles to achieve the ZWSM, are explicitly introduced. Third, A Zero-Warehousing Smart Manufacturing Platform (ZWSMP) is developed with the Internet of Things (IoT) enabled infrastructures. Corresponding logistics services are presented to provide information visibility and achieve operations improvement. A case study of the Hong Kong prefabrication construction project is used to demonstrate the materials delivery process among different supply chain partners to provide a basis for zero-warehousing achievement.}

The digital transformation of processes and the implementation of new technologies collectively referred to as Industry 4.0 do not have to be exclusively deployed by the "all or nothing" system. Modularity of intelligent logistics solutions designed according to the principles of cyber-physical systems allows for a gradual transformation of the entire chain. The Transport Sector of the European Union is an important element in building the whole market. The main task of freight transport is the movement of goods from supplier to customer. The digital transformation of enterprises and also the automation of production are built by norm and necessity. It is not only about product expansion, but above all about the sustainability of all processes. This is a really urgent requirement in transport. The fastest way to increase work efficiency is to automate existing processes using state-of-the-art job optimization and management technologies. Automating data exchange processes is an effective way to streamline communication and promote the smooth running of individual operations within the supply chain. Digitalization and automation of business processes helps to facilitate the work of employees and, above all, positively influences the company’s results.}

This research investigates how to encourage consumers’ sustainable decision-making in the web-shop’s check-out page by using non-financial incentives only. To this end, we carry out an online experiment among Belgian consumers to assess and compare the impact of four incentives: (1) information, (2) options order, (3) social media share and (4) social norm. The experiment demonstrates that providing information on the ecological footprint of delivery options is the most decisive incentive. The impact of social media shares and social norms are positive, while reversing the order of delivery options has limited effects.

In this paper, a bi-objective vehicle routing problem with stochastic demands (BO-VRPSD) was investigated, which aims to minimize total cost and customer dissatisfaction. Different from traditional vehicle routing problem (VRP) models, both the uncertainty in customer demands and the nature of multiple objectives make the problem more challenging. To cope with BO-VRPSD, a membrane-inspired multi-objective algorithm (MIMOA) was proposed, which is characterized by a parallel distributed framework with two operation subsystems and one control subsystem, respectively. In particular, the operation subsystems leverage a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm with clustering strategy to reduce the chance of inferior solutions. Meanwhile, the control subsystem exploits a guiding strategy as the communication rule to adjust the searching directions of the operation subsystems. Experimental results based on the ten 120-node instances with real geographic locations in Beijing show that, MIMOA is more superior in solving BO-VRPSD to other classical multi-objective evolutionary algorithms.}

Afflicted by problems of logistics blocks, labor shortages, and drops in demand, 80% of SMEs were temporarily closed at the time of the first wave of interviews in February 2020. After reining in COVID-19, authorities largely eased lockdown restrictions in April. Consequently, most SMEs had reopened by the time of the second round of surveys in May. However, many firms, particularly export firms, were running at partial capacity, primarily due to inadequate demand. Moreover, around 19% of incorporated enterprises and 25% of self-employed businesses had permanently closed between the two waves of surveys.}

However, cost and complexity are often significant factors that limit the spatial and temporal coverage of such monitoring systems. Most existing proposals are expensive, complex and/or are un-malleable for adaptation to other environmental sensing applications. This paper presents a simple and flexible open-source IoT (Internet of Things) electronics design for viable near real-time environmental measurements – specifically tailored to the rigors of aquatic settings. The system provides the minimal required functionality for reliable remote sensor readings with a focus on low energy consumption, renewal energy supply, plug and play deployments, and stability over time. The system development is driven by actual deployment logistics and constraints. We compare three revisions of the system/circuit and show how we aspired towards the aforementioned goals, whilst outlining the evolution of the design based on practical experience. A performance evaluation of the system is given in terms of functionality, stability, cost and energy consumption. The IoT platform is at the core of an affordable near real-time aquatic monitoring system that has been used in multiple water quality studies. The system has been adapted for use in other applications including water height monitoring and air dust sensing.}

Furthermore, the choice of technique can reduce the amount of drug administered, thereby improving the side effect profile. All opiates, regardless of the technique employed, require meticulous and careful titration based upon sound understanding. Training of staff and education of patients regarding the logistics of the chosen route is important to ensure optimal opiate delivery and detection of undesirable adverse events.

However, with the rapid development of drone-related technologies (i.e., small unmanned aerial vehicles), drone-based parcel delivery is considered a viable alternative for delivery to such areas. In this paper, we propose a drone scheduling model to maximize the minimum delivery amount to the target islands. In particular, a robust optimization is adopted to consider the uncertainties of wind direction and speed. To capture the impact of wind on the performance of the proposed scheduling models, we conducted a sensitivity analysis. Moreover, we performed validation experiments with real weather data to determine the feasibility of the proposed models and cross-check the sensitivity analysis results. The results indicate that the proposed robust optimization-based approach achieves better performance than the deterministic model under strengthening wind conditions. Stronger wind corresponds to a better performance of the proposed model. Also, a cost analysis was conducted to support the usage of drones for parcel delivery to remote islands, and it showed that the longer the drone-based delivery is operated, the more operation costs can be saved in comparison with the current practice.}

Anchored on the technology acceptance model (TAM), a partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) is applied based on the survey conducted on freight forwarders who are major customers of container lines. Results indicate that digital satisfaction and digital trust positively affect overall customer loyalty, while perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and digital trust positively influence digital satisfaction. Results of the study show that those digitalized services and operations of container lines have already started to influence overall customer loyalty.

This paper describes a review of historical oil spills that found only between 2 and 6% of the total oil spilled was recovered. The limiting factors affecting mechanical recovery in offshore settings include environmental conditions, oil behavior, and logistics. Mechanical recovery will always be an important tool for spill response, especially in nearshore and in-port settings, as well as locations with sensitivity to chemical dispersants and/or in situ burning. However, its application in large offshore spills will generally result in recovery of only a fraction of the spilled oil.}

About 40% of Russia’s oil reserves and more than half of its gas reserves are concentrated here, which makes it attractive for development. However, the Arctic has not yet been fully developed. This is due to permafrost, cold climate, and the lack of logistics in the area. It is crucial to maintain a wide front of research in the North at the proper level since it is important for the development of the economic potential of the region and strengthening of the country’s defense. Therefore, it is necessary to create conditions stimulating the investment of resource-extracting companies and the use of all available capacities. In this article, we suggest using cold to advantage. The effective use of natural and climatic features of the Arctic is possible not only when organizing industrial enterprises but also when creating a favorable living environment for their personnel. On the one hand, low average annual temperatures constitute an obstacle for reducing the costs of maintaining living conditions, and on the other hand, they make it possible to form efficient clusters for computing equipment of all kinds, which requires a cooling system. For this kind of equipment, a decrease in the ambient temperature by 20–30 degrees eliminates the need to use expensive liquid cooling systems.}

With the rapidly growing interest in the vision of lot-size-of-one, a fundamental and challenging question remains open: How can robots leverage the knowledge of previously-learned tasks to expedite their learning on new tasks? We tackle this problem by developing and testing a novel deep reinforcement learning framework with task modularization to enhance adaptability of collaborative robots in performing a multitude of simulated tasks. The framework is built upon the actor-critic method and the notion of task modularity, and is compared against the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm as a baseline. Numerical experiments on the Meta-World dataset prove the ability of the proposed framework in improving the adaptability and efficiency of collaborative robots to new tasks through task modularization and transfer of policies from previously-learned task modules.}

abstract = {We are currently developing a modular and decentralized learning factory to demonstrate Industry 4.0 and Logistics 4.0 scenarios to both, students and employees from the companies. The factory shall allow the setup and evaluation of any preferred factory layout. One major challenge is the design of an appropriate strategy for communication between the factory modules and the identification of adequate communication technologies. There are two main requirements, which we consider for the communication design. First, the communication shall be wireless in order to reduce the effort for changing the factory structure. Second, the communication strategy shall allow an easy identification of the current factory layout and the interconnection of factory resources. According to our current state of knowledge, we believe that LiFi (Light Fidelity) is a suitable technology to fulfill these requirements. In the paper, we discuss the benefits and drawbacks of LiFi as communication technology and present a concept for the integration of LiFi in our learning factory.}

To do this, we examined the biopharmaceutical industry in the Ile-de-France region in north-central France. We performed a longitudinal study from 2005 to 2016, building on structural holes and personal network efficiency methodology. Our results confirm the centrality of public actors in structuring and diffusing knowledge within a PPINS; the role of structural holes in controlling and filtering transferred knowledge, the main beneficiaries of which are private actors; and finally, the evolution and development of the PPINS around these central private/public actors. The network reveals that product-service innovation in the sector would be difficult to achieve without complex private/public interdependencies (knowledge, big data, logistics, digital therapies, etc.). Our paper also stresses on the need to move forward the public economic model from a public service into an innovative service to the public.}

City hubs are one means of mitigating this problem by consolidating goods of different suppliers at the hub and cooperating in the last mile delivery. Because of the general shortage of urban space, a major challenge is finding an appropriate location for such a hub. This paper provides a decision support tool based on the analytic hierarchy process for the hub location selection problem, which considers quantitative and qualitative criteria. By involving three stakeholder groups – the municipality, logistics companies and citizens – the approach insures a comprehensive view. The application of the model is tested for the location selection of a midi-hub – a medium-sized city hub – in Vienna. Hence, our results show that a good compromise between different stakeholder views regarding a mid-hub location selection problem can be achieved by the application of our AHP-based decision support tool.}

Our review of current regulatory approaches shows a need for further policy and management response to both manage rapid and efficient drone usage growth, and facilitate innovation (e.g. intraurban package delivery), with one promising strategic response being low altitude airspace management (LAAM) systems for all drone use cases.}

The results indicated that, according to the decision-maker, the accessibility to/from warehouses and the land costs are the factors that most influence a respective location choice. Additionally, the accessibility to the infrastructure to deliver the goods has a strong positive correlation with the accessibility to receive the freight vehicles. The land cost has a negative correlation with all factors except the accessibility for the employees, indicating a divergent evaluation regarding the importance level of this factor. The results of the spatial analysis indicated that the warehouses are located near the ring-road and the retailers, not in commercially densified areas, and in areas with low land cost. The results could support the development of public policies that more coherently guide the location of these logistic facilities in urban areas.}

The paper utilizes data from the German Socio-Economic Panel and the Israeli Income Survey, 1991–2011, and includes logistics models and a decomposition analysis of the demographic components of trends in working poverty. Results document a pronounced increase in poverty risks among the Arab population and households with more than two children in Israel since 2000.

Numerous works illustrate the ability to control microstructure in fusion based processes and a few recent authors have even produced single crystals. However, a number of questions remain open regarding the process window which enables printing of single crystals. Furthermore, it has been observed that these additively manufactured single crystals exhibit a preferred 〈011〉 secondary orientation parallel to the scanning direction. In this work we investigate the fabrication conditions that enable printing of single crystals via electron beam melting. A space filling design of experiments is utilized to efficiently explore the fabrication space. Single crystals are successfully obtained using both commercially available powders and custom melt alloys. Microstructures obtained via these exploratory experiments exhibited a continuum of columnar structures ranging from weakly textured polycrystals, near single crystal, and fully single crystalline material. Complex geometry experiments are performed to study the grain selection mechanism. We find that the grain selection mechanism is independent of the bulk scale geometry and must therefore be driven by local heat transfer and solidification dynamics. Furthermore, grain selection is shown to be driven by competing driving forces; one which prefers epitaxial growth and another which is driven by the imposed processing conditions.}

To understand the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on SMEs in China and suggest public policies to deal with the negative effects, in February 2020, this paper examined the impacts on 3194 SMEs from primary, manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade, hospitality (accommodation and catering), and new economy industries in Sichuan, China using an online survey and follow-up interviews. It was found that the effects differed by industry sector: the primary industry sector by poor logistics; the manufacturing industry sector by supply chain management problems; the wholesale and retail trade industry sector by the need to accelerate their online services; the hospitality industry sector, the most severely affected sector, by cash flow pressure; and the new economy industry sector by short-term pressures. Short-term revenue declines and an inability to resume work and production were common problems faced by all surveyed SMEs. These findings from Sichuan, China provide some valuable references for global industry recovery.}

Nevertheless, little has been said about the multifold intertwinements between such ‘Western’ perceptions and their shaping of anti-terrorism efforts within. To this end, this paper draws on recent feminist understandings of scale, global/local processes, and geopolitics, suggesting how these might be combined with current European participations in Syria, and its legal prosecution as ‘state-endangering actions.’ By visiting the sites where issues on security, mobility, and their interrelated body actions have been negotiated, I deploy an intersectional and multi-scalar analysis of how a layered system of gender-rendered and racialized patterns intersects with/in Germany's legal institutions combating terrorism wherever it may occur as well as the way multifold and different modes of support and logistics have been carried out through the European Schengen Area to Syria. Combining both feminist geopolitics and the vibrant work of (feminist) geolegalities, I offer another way of redressing Hyndman's call (2019) for expanding the tent of feminist geopolitics by not reversing the former, but through refocusing on embodied and material power-geometries and (legally) interconnected sites of an Islam-rendered, Western state-defined ‘war on/of terrorism’ simultaneously.}

This IIoT refers to linked devices, sensors, and other equipment that may be networked in the industrial environment to provide remote access, effective monitoring, better data collecting, analysis, & exchange etc. In Industry 4.0, IIoT is fundamental to transforming cyber-physical systems and production processes through big data and analytics. This paper provides an overview of the IIoT and the technologies that underpin it. The primary benefits and features of IIoT in manufacturing are discussed in detail. Smart Transformations made into the manufacturing field through IIoT Culture are discussed diagrammatically. Finally, twenty-nine significant applications of IIoT in the field of manufacturing are identified and discussed. IIoT can monitor the transport, supply of the goods, consult details on things in warehouses, and check the conditions related to product storage and delivery and allow all dispersed and outsourced operations to be monitored. Therefore, the industry is being revolutionised by IIoT, altering the way industrial enterprises function daily to improve efficiency and performance levels.}

The emerge of improved personalized treatment adaptations and outcome prediction is accompanied with increasing non-invasive assessments in early treatment phase, leading to increased patient burden. This study assessed the adherence of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) to undergo pretreatment and research-related intratreatment imaging, and assessed which factors caused drop-out.
Method
Between 2013 and 2019, advanced-staged HNSCC patients were prospectively included, underwent (chemo) radiotherapy with curative intent and planned for both pre-treatment and intratreatment sequential 18F-FDG-PET/CT, 18F-FDG-PET/MRI and thereafter MRI (including DWI/DCE). Drop-out-factors were described as healthcare-related (logistics and imaging-system defects) and patient-related (psychological, physical, not-specified). Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) were routinely scored by radiation/medical oncologists throughout the first 3 weeks, and compared between patient drop-outs and who complete imaging.
Results
Ninety-seven patients (mean age 61 ± 6.8 years) were included; 95 patients (97.9%) underwent pretreatment imaging and 63 (64.9%) intratreatment imaging. For 18F-FDG-PET/CT, 18F-FDG-PET/MRI and MRI pretreatment drop-outs were 2, 10 and 3 patients and for intratreatment drop-outs were 34, 39 and 35 patients, respectively. Patient-related drop-out-factors were physical (n = 16, e.g. dysphagia), psychological (n = 6, e.g. claustrophobia) and non-specified (n = 12). Healthcare-related drop-out-factors were logistics (n = 6) and 18F-FDG-PET/CT-/MRI-system defects (n = 2). The CTC mucosal toxicity was significantly higher (p = 0.023) at week 2 of (chemo)radiotherapy in patient drop-outs than with complete imaging.
Conclusions
The drop-out frequency of advanced-staged HNSCC patients for imaging during (chemo)radiotherapy in a research-setting was high and mainly patient-related. Treatment of patient-related inconveniences, communication of rationale and healthcare-related imaging protocol efficiency improvements may contribute to improved adherence.}

To fill this gap, this study aims to examine the relationship between employees’ perception on corporate social responsibility (CSR), their job satisfaction, organisational trust and ultimately, organisational commitment to suggest academic and practical implications on sustainable management for international freight forwarders in Korea. For this study, 166 global logistics companies in Busan, one of the world’s leading maritime cities, were targeted, and questionnaires were surveyed from 10 April to 30 May 2019. A total of 265 questionnaires were analysed to verify the relevance of individual hypothesis in the research model through confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation model analysis using AMOS 18.0. The results of five hypotheses testing demonstrated a positive and significant effect except that Hypothesis 4 on ‘job satisfaction will have a significant effect on organisational commitment’ was rejected. Overall, this paper provides important insights into the significance of CSR in global freight forwarding companies with theoretical development and the empirical test of CSR model, highlighting the trust to increase the organisational commitment of employees.}
