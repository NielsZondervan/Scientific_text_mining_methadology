abstract = {The operation of non-public railway transport of mining enterprises is characterized by a large number of operational indicators: the number of locomotive and car fleets, infrastructure development, duration of movement and processing of cars, etc. The rhythmicity of functioning of railway complex is complicated significant non-uniformity of these parameters. Car flow structure which has become much more complicated in recent years, has a significant impact on transport and logistics processes. The reason for increase in the number of low-capacity car flows was increase in the number of companies whose carriages circulate along non-public routes. In turn, similar structure of car flow, which is also characterized by significant unevenness and irregularity, leads to a complication of managing industrial transportation technology. A well-established railway mining enterprise transport system model needs to be transformed into a multi-factor system with a large number of functional relations. One of the most effective tools for transforming transportation and production systems is the logistic approach. The idea of campaign is to integrate individual links of material production into a single system, ordered along material flows and able to adequately respond to environmental disturbances. The scale of mining enterprises, the complexity and high dynamics of transport and logistics processes, as well as the multivariate managing mining transportation systems scenarios, require development of new methods of such systems functioning analysis and prediction. The article proposes a new approach to the study of operation of non-public railway transport, based on system-dynamic simulation of logistics system of a mining enterprise.}

This DSS addresses the stacking problem for import containers via a two-step strategy. First, dwell times are predicted for each container using analytics techniques. This prediction is used as an input for a mathematical programming model that minimizes container rehandles heuristically. Numerical examples are presented using data from the Port of Arica in Chile as a case study. The results confirm the virtues of the proposed DSS to effectively support planning decisions at the container yard. Furthermore, results also show good performance of the operations at the yard in terms of rehandles in comparison with the current practices of this port terminal and well-known stacking strategies.}

This has propelled the society to evaluate and seek sustainable development options, where Circular Economy (CE) emerged as a relevant concept. This embraced the accountability for reverse logistics of the end-of-life products, which is seen as a costly and complex effort to be managed. This article develops a taxonomy for critical success factors (CSFs) of the reverse logistics capable of creating value for the company and its supply chain, from the perspective of the CE technical cycle, and provides a framework that represents the relationship between the CSFs and reverse logistics in the context of the circular supply chain. The methodology adopted was the tertiary literature review using content analysis with a sample of 66 reviews. The proposed taxonomy embraced five CSFs: Material Planning and Management, Life Cycle Assessment, Industrial Sustainability, Information and Communication Technology, and Promoters and Relationships. The framework illustrates how each component of the circular supply chain (i.e. Circular Inputs, Product Design, Process Design and Circular Flows) is influenced by the five CSFs of the reverse logistics obtained, highlighting the Promoters and Relationships CSF, since it influences all components of the circular supply chain and, consequently, reverse logistics.}

It highlights the impacts of planning policies and financial circuits on their spatial and institutional configurations. In this perspective, along with their logistics roles, the chapter underlines three main dimensions of the current systems of production of logistics spaces: the modalities of the financialization of logistics properties, the scope and effectiveness of planning policies for logistics facilities, and the scope of traditional public infrastructure regulations and management regimes. These three main dimensions are indeed the three central variables of the existing modes of governance of logistics spaces.}

The recent proliferation of big data sources has given rise to a data deluge. Network theory has become the standard methodology to frame, develop and analyze such massive datasets. In line with the critique of Schwanen (2016), we argue in this paper that initiatives confronting network-based insights with (qualitative) location- and domain-specific insights are necessary in understanding, discussing and advancing the role network analysis can play in geography. By iterating a community detection algorithm to achieve different levels of communities and quantifying the borders between them through damping values (as proposed in Grauwin et al., 2017), we show how to derive the hierarchical structure within the logistics buyer-supplier network in Belgium. This allows for a richer geography, which has been missing in current big data studies.}

This study designs an optimal collaboration strategy by solving the collaborative logistics pickup and delivery problem with eco-packages (CLPDPE). This problem seeks to minimize the total operational costs by forming collaborative alliances and allocating trucking resources based on time–space (TS) network properties. The synchronization of two-echelon logistics networks is improved by solving this problem. Moreover, this study considers the stability of collaboration (i.e., the willingness of logistics companies to join and remain in collaborative alliances) by comparing different profit allocation strategies in the CLPDPE solving process. A novel methodology that combines multi-objective mixed integer programming, multidimensional K-means clustering, reference point based non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (RP-NSGA-II), forward dynamic programming and improved Shapley value method is developed to formulate and solve CLPDPE. Our results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms most other algorithms in minimizing the total cost, waiting time and number of vehicles. An empirical case study in Chongqing city, China suggests that the proposed collaborative mechanism and transportation resource sharing strategy based on TS network can reduce cost, improve distribution efficiency, and contribute to efficient, smart, intelligent and sustainable urban logistics and transportation systems.}

Yet, on a sub-regional level South Asia is the weakest region among all Asian sub-regions. This gives raise to the question what separates South Asian countries from their more successful East and South East neighbouring countries. The general question why certain countries manage to attract FDI while others fail has been frequently addressed in literature. Moreover, research in logistics and transportation claims on a host of determinants that explains the location considerations of MNEs based on host country logistic performance. By implementing these determinants into more traditional FDI and trade models our objective is to shed more light on the importance of the individual aspects of national transportation systems on the FDI and trade patterns in the Asian region. Moreover, we provide theoretical arguments and empirical evidence that national transportation systems moderate the effects of the different dimensions of (between-) country distance on international trade and FDI performance. Our findings show that the elements of national transportation systems positively influence both trade and FDI. Additionally, more developed national transportation systems are able to overcome the costs of distance to some degree. We also find support for the notion that the nature of the costs of geographic distance (e.g. transportation costs) differ between trade and FDI. While the former is related to international transportation and port infrastructure, the latter is based on within-country transportation and is moderated by land-based transportation infrastructure.}

Weather, geographical and operational constraints were considered for calculating the biomass availability. The model is able to quantify the production of sugar and first-generation ethanol from mills, electricity surplus from co-generation and second-generation ethanol with the aim of evaluating operational, economic and environmental indicators. In this study it was found that the integral harvesting is the best strategy for supply the residues in terms of cost (5.90 USD/dry t), energy inputs (56.89 MJ/dry t) and carbon emissions (4.18 kg CO2/dry t). The low resources utilization due to the inappropriate harvest-load-transport synchronization creates bottlenecks that decrease the system throughput, leaving the door open for further improvements.}

Around logistics hubs such as seaports, truck flows can have a major impact on the surrounding motorways. Hence, their prediction is important to help manage traffic operations. However, The link between short-term dynamics of logistics activities and the generation of truck traffic has not yet been properly explored. This paper aims to develop a model that predicts short-term changes in truck volumes, generated from major container terminals in maritime ports. We develop, test, and demonstrate the model for the port of Rotterdam. Our input data are derived from exchanges of operational logistics messages between terminal operators, carriers and shippers, via the local Port Community System. We propose a feed-forward neural network to predict the next one hour of outbound truck traffic. To extract hidden features from the input data and select a model with appropriate features, we employ an evolutionary algorithm in accordance with the neural network model. Our model predicts outbound truck volumes with high accuracy. We formulate 2 scenarios to evaluate the forecasting abilities of the model. The model predicts lag and non-proportional responses of truck flows to changes in container turnover at terminals. The findings are relevant for traffic management agencies to help improve the efficiency and reliability of transport networks, in particular around major freight hubs.}

The present study identified and examined the existing constraints and proposes the improvements to increase the performance of the existing inbound milk-run system.

The contributions of this study were the reduction in 15% of the milk-run lap time, the decrease of the number of milk-run laps, allowing the increase of the number of lines assisted by this intralogistics system, permitting the assignment of new tasks to the MRS operator during the idle time.

We focused on analysis of the impact that digitalization has on new business relationships evolving, on the nature of interactions among participants in the distribution chain and on designing the market’s logistics landscape. Our goal consisted in analyzing the impact of market participants’ competencies based on knowledge, skills and abilities on cooperation with another organization. The main source of data in this study is the responses of respondents to an online survey taken in 2020. We included enterprises of the southern Russian region, with transport and road service enterprises among others, and entrepreneurs of infobusiness from other regions as the research sample for this study. A great number of new terms and concepts appear in the modern world of digital technologies, so in many cases, business managers and entrepreneurs are unable to structure the flow of information, which results in substitution of concepts. For this reason, the study aims to investigate the degree to which businesses are aware of the possibilities of digitalization and are familiar with the essence of ecosystem business models. While the results obtained indicate that there is a significant variety of interpretations of the ecosystem, it should be borne in mind that the sample focused on enterprises does not demonstrate a consistent understanding of platform tools and all their applications.}

This research uses a production function of the type proposed by Mankiw et al. (1992) to study the effect of logistics on scale efficiency through data envelopment analysis (DEA) for one hundred and thirty-three countries in the world during the period 2007-2018. This research establishes that logistics is an important channel for improving scale efficiency for the countries of the world in view of the estimation results. This research contributes to the literature by estimating the contribution of each of the components of the Logistics Performance Index (LPI), developed by the World Bank, to scale efficiency. The results highlight the significant impact of logistics on global efficiency. Available World Bank data show that a 1% increase in the logistics performance index increases the current global level of the efficiency scale by 0.42%.}

abstract = {Gamification is the art of making non-game context more engaging and fun, with the help of game mechanics. Production and Logistics are good examples of non-game context, which could benefit a lot from increased engagement. Gamification already manifested its potential in many other branches (e.g. education, health, marketing, social networks and work) and for that reason, it can be claimed that this potential also applies in the domain of industrial shopfloor. However, the question for specific game elements for these environments is still unanswered. Therefore, we developed a gamification configurator to support production managers in the selection of suitable game elements for their specific environment, considering different manifestations of human motivation. To do so, we require a specific framework for gamification in production and logistics. As a result, the gamification framework Octalysis in Production and Logistics is the basis for the creation of a corresponding gamification configurator. The resulting configurator is a starting point to identify, select and implement specific game elements in production and logistics. This article aims to bring new insights into the area of gamification in production and logistics from a conceptual point of view. Furthermore, the developed gamification configurator enables the selection of specific game elements for production and logistics. Other domains like health, marketing or entertainment already benefit from the concept of gamification, e.g. by increasing user motivation or customer engagement.}

However, since mathematical modeling of multiple site selection often turns out to be NP-hard problem structure, it is not always possible to obtain an optimal solution by the solvers. For this reason, various meta-heuristic approaches have emerged to solve these complex models. In this context, the aim of this study is to propose an integrated methodology which seeks an optimum result efficiently regarding a logistics center location selection problem. Thus, the optimal clustering of logistics mobility in a metropolitan area was carried out with GIS and a meta-heuristic approach. GIS produced the spatial information needed by p-median model, then the meta-heuristic approach determined the optimal result that considers the logistics costs. BPSO algorithm has employed as the meta-heuristic and it is observed that the algorithm can reach the optimum results within superior times for the problem sizes tested where binary integer programming verified the optimums and the algorithm continued to reach improved solutions where the exact algorithms failed for larger instances. The integrated solution methodology is applied to a large metropolitan region and it is found that it can be used properly by the urban city planners and supply chain managers to analyze critical nodes of transportation networks of megacities.}

The process, capable of generating profits as well as minimizing negative environmental effects, mainly includes products acquisition, collection, inspection and disposition. Although the selection of take-back patterns is an essential part in the process, it is not well addressed by existing studies. Involving numerous related factors, the evaluation and selection of the take-back patterns of scrap cars are a comprehensive problem that can be formulated as a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem. In this paper, we propose a complete method to solve it systematically. Three patterns quite suitable for China are presented and a novel criteria system is developed for choosing the best one. The unavoidable uncertainty in practical situation is also considered in this work. We integrate the grey method and Decision-making and Trial Evaluation Laboratory (grey DEMATEL) to determine the weights of nine criteria, and a fuzzy method and Vlse Kriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (fuzzy VIKOR) are adopted to rank the three patterns based on expert evaluations. Sensitivity analysis is also used to test and verify the robustness of the proposed method. Finally, we draw a conclusion that the Producer Responsibility Organization Take-back pattern whose main body is formed by manufacturer union organization is most suitable for China. The study results could provide a theoretical guideline for decision-makers in China as well as other developing countries.}

abstract = {The proper management of urban loading/unloading facilities is crucial for both the efficiency of the logistic services and urban traffic systems. Thanks to the advances in technologies, such management can be achieved through prebooked systems. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive and unified auction-based approach to optimize the use of prebooked loading and unloading facilities, based on a previous work of the authors. The new proposed approach assigns parking spots to companies and computes the price of the service, to maximize the social welfare of the system. It has the following advantages over the previous system: (i) by employing an auction’s formulation based on the Vickrey–Clarke–Groves mechanism, the proposed system explicitly considers the heterogeneity in the penalty functions; (ii) uncertainty in the carrier arrivals due to traffic condition is handled explicitly with an online readjustment and two robust formulations. The proposed auction system is tested on instances inspired by the logistic system in the city of Barcelona. Results show that compared to the previous work, the new approach exploiting the use of new information improves the social welfare by up to 22% with heterogeneous carriers. Results further show that the scenarios where demand is uniformly distributed over the time horizon present better utilities than the scenarios where demand is concentrated following a peak hour behavior. It is also shown that the proposed online readjustment formulation performs similar to the global offline optimum, and significantly improves the social welfare of the system when carriers fail to arrive at the allocated time due to traffic uncertainties.}

This paper investigates a novel green winner determination problem that has several features, including (i) the sustainable attributes with conflicting and interactive properties of potential 3PLs, and (ii) the loss-averse behavior with an internal reference point of a fourth party logistics (4PL) provider. For the attributes with a combination of crisp data, interval numbers and intuitionistic 2-tuple linguistic terms, we integrate the prospect theory (PT) and Choquet integral with the “benefits, opportunities, costs and risks (BOCR)” framework to propose a novel PTC-BOCR solution method. Numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness and applicability of PTC-BOCR by comparing it with some known methods. Comparison analysis indicates that PTC-BOCR is robust with respect to the variance of 3PLs’ attribute values, while behavioral parameter analysis reveals that the loss-averse behavior of the 4PL is intensified as the difference of 3PLs varies. Managerial insights are also drawn for green 3PLs to win the auction. This study is a significant extension of traditional decision-making methods, which could benefit the realization of a sustainable logistics system in a cost-effective way for 4PLs.}

The latter's importance is emphasized for delivering efficient logistics that is perceived as adequately meeting customer demands. In particular, the pivotal role of good logistics in facilitating growth in both trade and GDP is spelled out. The part played in logistics by freight transportation is then addressed more specifically, with issues relating to the characteristics and nature of alternative modes and freight mode choice analyzed. The relationship of logistics to different forms and types of cargo, as well as to geographical scale, is identified and the implications for in-country freight movements illuminated by example from the EU. Finally, the nature of logistics decisions at organizational level is discussed with respect to changes in the sector's systems and technologies over time and into the future.}

Reverse logistics (RL) allows for a cost-effective treatment of residual items with environmentally friendly practices. This paper aims to design a RL network for large OTR tires discarded from scattered mining sites, which requires a substantial initial investment in tire downsizing equipment. Therefore, the on-site use of a single shared shredding resource set is proposed with a schedule of visits between mines. Our contribution is a mixed-integer linear programming model set to determine the OTR tires optimal network, including decisions regarding a tire-fuelled power plant location, tire shredding and transport amounts, and a shredding resource set schedule to maximize the profits of the RL network while considering whole waste tire stockpile limits per year. Results showed that the proposed RL network starting from mine shredding tires and supplying a power generation plant might be a profitable solution that could help mines to comply with the legal regulations and turn this waste into a positive economic value good. Environmental and social implications are the mitigation of scrap tires, an increased job demand triggered by power plants, and public health improvement in the vicinity of the mining sites.}

This paper proposes a method of evaluation of the sustainability of new technologies of Industry 4.0 in internal logistics. The proposed framework demonstrates data management technique of the industrial robots. Since, the AMR with manipulator perform different tasks as a single system in logistics there is big demand to develop model of cyber physical system.

A supplier park is a cluster of suppliers located adjacent to an assembly plant. The parts of each type are picked up from the corresponding supplier in the park and are delivered to a buffer beside a given station of the assembly line in predetermined homogeneous packages. On a finite time horizon, the initial inventory level of each buffer at the beginning of the horizon and the quantity of each type of parts consumed on each point are given. Our problem is to make delivery schedules for capacitated trucks such that the total transportation time is minimized, and the inventory level of each buffer is within a given range at any moment within the horizon. A time-indexed integer linear programming (IP) model is proposed for the problem, and a column generation based algorithm (CGBB) is developed to solve the problem efficiently. Computational experiments based on randomly generated data and a case study based on real data collected from one of the major automotive manufacturers in China are conducted, respectively. The results show that the proposed CGBB algorithm outperforms solving the IP model by CPLEX and the greedy method used in practice. It is capable of generating high-quality solutions for the problem efficiently, and is practical to be used in daily operations.}

abstract = {The routing of a fleet of autonomous and free ranging vehicles in in-house logistics is a complex task. Generally speaking, routing requires the determination of routes between sources and sinks (route planning) and rules to deal with detecting and solving routing conflicts between vehicles during operation (dynamic motion coordination). This publication introduces a new, lane-based approach for routing of free ranging vehicles. It bases on the idea of an a-priori design of multiple lanes, whereas a single lane is defined as a static, unidirectional and plane connection between a specific start and destination point in the layout. The basic idea of the described lane concept is to achieve short travel distances and low probabilities of routing conflicts for a fleet of free ranging vehicles. Accordingly, this paper also presents an appropriate heuristic for lane design and discusses its benefits compared to an exact approach in the context of applicability for real world sized problems. Further, an application in a test case shows the advantages of the lane-based routing, such as a lower amount of routing conflicts, lower transportation times and therefore an overall higher transportation system performance compared to two benchmark strategies for routing.}

abstract = {In recent years, the adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) based smart parcel lockers has developed very rapidly in Asia due to the wider applications from retailers, e-commerce companies, logistics companies, and consumers. The revolution of smart technologies has transformed the traditional way of last-mile delivery from logistics outlets to IoT-based parcel lockers due to the flexibility, convenience, and 24/7 accessibility. However, there are still many obstacles affecting the transformation of last-mile delivery especially in consumers perceptions towards the smart technologies. Therefore, in this study, we performed research based on the theory of service quality and customer satisfaction in the adoption of relevant technologies. This article divides the smart parcel lockers' service quality into five dimensions: service price, service reliability, convenience, fault handling capability, and service diversity. In this study, 272 valid questionnaires were collected from China to investigate consumer satisfaction with the smart parcel locker services. Statistical analysis, including the reliability and validity, was performed, followed by confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The correlation between variables and the degree of influence on customer satisfaction and regression analysis was also undertaken in this study. The results revealed that the service price does not positively affect consumer satisfaction, and the other four underlying factors have a positive effect on consumer satisfaction. This research has significant impacts by determining the parcel lockers' core factors so as to foster the further development of last-mile services in the future.}

However, the existing literature did not pay enough attention in interrogating the impacts of Carbon Tax (CT) and Carbon Quota (CQ) policy on distribution costs and carbon dioxide emission in the field of vehicle routing problem. Moreover, the investigated subsidies factor is also incomplete. This research stands on the position of the company to study the impact of CT and CQ policy on aforementioned two aspects. A mathematical model is developed to achieve the best low carbon vehicle routing under the optimal policy. The optimization goal of this research is to minimize the total cost that includes vehicle-using, transportation, CT, CQ, and raw material subsidy costs. An improved optimization algorithm, namely Genetic Algorithm-Tabu Search (GA-TS), is proposed to solve a given business case. In the simulation experiments, GA-TS and a traditional GA are compared and the results show the advantage of GA-TS on reducing the total cost and carbon dioxide emission. Furthermore, the experiments also explore the total cost and carbon dioxide emission under three scenarios (Benchmark, CT and CQ), incorporating four policies: CT, Carbon Tax Subsidy (CTS), CQ, and Carbon Quota Subsidy (CQS). It is concluded that CQS is the ideal policy to minimize distribution cost and carbon dioxide emission. In addition, the impact of vehicles’ capacities on the total cost and carbon dioxide emission is also analyzed in this research. This research also aimed at assisting practitioners in better formulating delivery routes, as well as policy makers in developing carbon policies. Finally, the limitations and the future research directions of this research are also discussed.}

The following environmental impact categories are considered: climate change; particulate matter caused by emission of inorganic substances; photochemical smog formation; acidification. The results show that, compared to current delivery methods, the adoption of EV is associated with an environmental impact reduction between −40% and −50% for global warming and photochemical smog formation, and a reduction between −15% and −25% for acidification. The adoption of the EVs increases the particulate matter emissions compared to diesel vehicles (by up to + 13%) due to the carbon intensity of the national power system, while it reduces them by −7% when at least 50% of the electricity is sourced from dedicated photovoltaic columns.}

The model incorporates risk measures to resolve the stochastic scheduling problem where the uncertainty of demand, transit time and unloading time are taken into account. The developed model considers the transit cargoes and the various transportation options under time window limitations. In order to select the most effective risk measure, four well-known risk measures are evaluated including Value at Risk (VaR), Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR), Tail Value at Risk (TVaR) and Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD). A two-phase hierarchical algorithm with an integrated novel Golden Search (GS) algorithm is developed to deal with the proposed bi-objective model. In order to cope with the large scale problems, the Sample Average Approximation (SAA) and Scenario Decomposition (SD) methods are further proposed. A Lagrangian Decomposition (LD) algorithm is then developed to estimate the best lower bound of the SD. The efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed model and solution framework has been validated via sets of sensitivity analysis tests. The results of analysis define the optimal flows of the cargoes across the most economic corridor.}

abstract = {Owing to the fast economic and social development in Wuhan, the demand for cold chain logistics is increasing rapidly. Currently, the scale of the existing distribution centers cannot fully meet this demand, so building new ones would seem necessary. Research rarely considers consumer choice from the perspective of competition between new and existing cold chain distribution centers, and the low-carbon concept is rarely considered when a competitive site is selected. This paper therefore puts forward a model to assist the decision-making process regarding the choice of location where cold chain logistics facilities might be sited. Based on a bi-level programming method, this model is constructed where the upper level of government aims to determine an optimal location and scale for a cold chain distribution center as well as a rational trading policy regarding carbon emissions to minimize the total social cost of the whole logistics system. The lower level adopts the demand user equilibrium model, which considers the demands of logistics users when choosing between new and existing cold chain distribution centers, so as to minimize the cost incurred by each logistics user. We use the cloud particle swarm optimization algorithm to solve the model and decide a suitable location for a new center in Wuhan, the principal city in the Hubei Province, in China. The study reveals that: (1) The high demand is equivalent to the high number of new distribution centers; (2) The high attractiveness of these centers is equal to their high total scale; (3) Changes in carbon emissions trading prices have an impact on the scale, total carbon emissions, and total social cost of new cold chain distribution centers; (4) The carbon emissions quota policy has an impact on the scale of the location chosen for a new cold chain distribution center, total carbon emissions, and total social costs. This article provides a scientific basis regarding decisions concerning the location of new cold chain distribution centers by the government, and provides some ideas for energy conservation improvement and carbon emissions reduction by the whole society.}

abstract = {The improvement of logistics operation management for many tobacco companies highly depends on the reduction of distribution costs. In order to optimize routes, cigarettes are delivered through online real-time distribution system equipped with GIS/GPS. These network information technologies are crucial to creating and maintaining an efficient distribution system. Considering the applicability and flexibility of GIS/GPS network information system, this paper assesses the impact of its implementation on the logistics distribution cost from both overall and household levels. Specifically, DID and pseudo-DID models were adopted and monthly panel data of 14 prefecture-level branches of Hunan Tobacco Company during 2016-2019 were used for regression.We find that the implementation of GIS/GPS network information systems increased the total distribution cost. However, the average distribution cost was significantly reduced at per household level as the customer base expanded. A series of robustness and sensitivity tests supported above results. Furthermore, the implementation of GIS/GPS network information system is beneficial to service quality and employee performance. In addition, more time and logistics costs were saved when drivers chose “dynamic + fixed optimization” route model.}

Using finely disaggregated exports data for Turkey’s trade with 174 countries over the period 2007–2017, we decompose gross export flows into the extensive and intensive margins of Turkish exports utilizing the method developed by Hummels and Klenow (2005). Gravity estimates suggest that logistics infrastructure positively influences export values and has a greater impact on the extensive margin than the intensive margin. Our empirical analysis further suggests that Turkish exporters are more sensitive to changes in local market logistics conditions than to those of their trade partners. These findings are robust to a variety of alternative measures and estimation methods.}

While uncertainties arising due to randomness can be avoided for post-disaster location problem, those arising because of impreciseness may persist long after the disaster's occurrence. Despite the uncertainties and lack of sufficient information about the extent of the damage, disaster response facilities must be established quickly after the occurrence of the disaster. Moreover, the decisions of whether to open, where to locate, and when to open disaster response facilities are based on the amount and quality of information available during the decision-making period. To address these issues, we develop a multi-objective location-allocation model for relief supply and distribution that accounts for the imprecise and time-varying nature of different parameters and time-varying coverage, while also accommodating the subjective attributes necessary to enable establishment and operation of the temporary logistics hubs (TLHs). A credibility-based fuzzy chance-constrained programming model is employed to account for the impreciseness inherent in predicting parameter values during disaster response. The results show where, when, and how many TLHs to open and how to allocate relief supplies. Meanwhile, the sensitivity analysis provides a broader understanding of the impact of limiting the number of TLHs as well as the confidence level and the spread of the symmetric triangular fuzzy numbers on the attainment of the model objectives.}

Organizations should first determine which measures are appropriate to meet their strategic objectives and guidance is provided on criteria for measure selection. Organizations then need to select an appropriate performance measurement system or framework to operationalize the selected measures in concert with any certification or accreditation schemes for their particular sector.

As a result, steel logistics is concerned with the storage and movement of – in our case – work in process (WIP) materials. Thousands of tons of steel are transported with cranes and heavy-duty vehicles and stored in stacks at large yards every day. The whole industry is under pressure to reduce costs, which strongly influences logistics operations. The efficiency of transport and storage processes is a crucial success factor and is challenged by highly dynamic processes and environments. In this article we focus on slab logistics with respect to logistics performance measurement, quality assurance, and operational control in the processes that directly follow the continuous caster. Closely related to this, we concentrate on selected aspects of the steel production value chain, especially concerning the logistics part. We evaluate the performance measurement and simultaneously show how quality assurance may be supported. Finally, methods from the domain of prescriptive analytics are employed to automate or support human resources in handling complex logistics operations.}

As there is an increasing interest in shipping goods by container, and that delivery points can be far from railways in various areas of interest, it is important to evaluate techniques for managing container transport that involves several days. The time horizon considered is a whole working week, rather than a single day as in classical drayage problems. Truck fleet management companies are typically interested in such optimization, as they plan how to match their truck to the incoming transportation order. This planning is a relevant both for strategical consideration and operational ones, as prices of transportation orders strictly depends on how they are fulfilled. It is worth noting that, from a mathematical point of view, this is an NP-Hard problem. In this paper, a Decision Support System for managing the tasks to be assigned to each truck of a fleet is presented, in order to optimize the number of transportation order fulfilled in a week. The proposed system implements a hybrid optimization algorithm capable of improving the performances typically presented in literature. The proposed heuristic implements an hybrid genetic algorithm that generate chains of consecutive orders that can be executed by a truck. Moreover, it uses an assignment algorithm based to evaluate the optimal solution on the selected order chains.}

The conventional correlation analysis is used to establish the relationship among the variables for 10 year period with a view to understanding the growth in the graduates of the disciplines and the institutions that offer the programmes in relation to the economic growth and development of the country. The findings show that there is positive relationship among indices of economic development, however reveal negative but significant relationship between graduates and Institutions of Logistics and Transport, indicating that training is very important to the development of the country. It further shows that most Logistics and Transport firms do not place premium on the certification and qualification of employees with transport and logistics certificate background, hence recruited more people without Logistics and Transport knowledge/skills background. The paper advocates for more efforts to sustain the trend in getting more institutions offering transport and logistics graduate programmes to address the human capacity gap in the discipline and profession in the country and its economic growth and development.}

abstract = {Today, in many organizations, the debate about the difference in core capabilities has become an important factor for market competition. Companies, based on the field of activity, decide to strengthen some of their capabilities, capacities, and expertise. Therefore, the focus of an organization on the strengths and efforts to develop its sustainability will lead to a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Due to changes in environmental factors, organizations have focused on carbon emissions in procurement and transportation that have the highest carbon footprint. This paper proposes a multi-objective, eco-sustainability model for a supply chain. The objectives are to minimize overall costs, maximize the efficiency of transportation vehicles and minimize information fraud in the process of information sharing within supply chain elements. Big data is considered in the amount of information exchanged between customers and other elements of the proposed supply chain; since there are frauds in information sharing then using big data 5Vs the model is adapted to control the cost of information loss leading to customer dissatisfaction. Since uncertainty is inevitable in the real environments, in this research hybrid uncertainty is considered. Because two sources of uncertainty are considered in most of the parameters, thus it is necessary to robustify the decision-making process. The model is a mixed integer nonlinear program including big data for an optimal sustainable procurement and transportation decision. A heuristic method is used to solve the big data problem that makes use of a robust fuzzy stochastic programming approach. The proposed model can prevent disturbances by using a scenario-based stochastic programming approach. An effective hybrid robust fuzzy stochastic method is also employed for controlling uncertainty in parameters and risk taking out of outbound decisions. To solve the multi-objective model, augmented ε-constraint method is utilized. The model performance is investigated in a comprehensive computational study.}

This model is an extension of the general single-vendor multi-buyer synchronization model to incorporate reverse logistics, and it includes costs associated with production, remanufacturing, transportation and holding inventory. The reverse logistics in the model is achieved by having the vendor pick up returned products from the buyers and then reprocess them for resale. Similar to the original synchronization model, the synchronization of our model is attained by coordinating the vendor's production cycle with both new products’ delivery cycles for transportation from the vendor to the buyers and used products’ pick-up cycles for transportation from the buyers to the vendor/recycler. A genetic algorithm is used for solving the problem. Numerical results show the benefits from this new synchronized cycles model compared to independent optimization with reverse logistics. Our findings further show that under low levels of returning products, the synchronized cycles coordination model with reverse logistics can reduce total system costs when compared with the independent optimization model without reverse logistics. Examples also show how the model with reverse logistics can perform economically better than the model without reverse logistics.}

During the peak of globalization, the ability of firms to distribute production and for countries to participate in global value chains was determined by their ability to ship goods reliably and at low cost. However, in part due to poor logistics, many developing countries are yet to participate fully in global value chains. Their production bases are dominated by agriculture and mining. Industrial production tends to be small scale. These sectors and their characteristics in developing countries, present several problems that compound the logistics problems that are faced. The main problems are poor infrastructure, high unit costs of shipments, low quality and unreliable services, fragmentation of services and outdated regulatory regimes, among others. While there are significant amounts of resources being invested in infrastructure, there is a need to pay just as much attention to logistics services. There are many developing countries that are showing signs of improvement in their logistics performance. The main lesson from their experiences is that addressing the weaknesses faced with logistics performance in developing economies requires multipronged approaches. A critical first step is to understand what the economy produces and the economic targets that the government wishes to attain. In many countries, defining a clear logistics strategy helps to prioritize among the many competing demands and to also better coordinate across the numerous stakeholders that need to be involved. Practical interventions are needed across infrastructure, regulation, institutional development, skills, and trade facilitation. The latter is particularly important for international shipments.}

abstract = {Third-party logistics (3PL) has involved a significant response among researchers and practitioners in the recent decade. In the global competitive scenario, multinational companies (MNCs) not only improve quality of service and increase efficiency, but also decrease costs by means of 3PL. However, the assessment and selection of 3PL is a very critical decision, comprising intricacy due to the existence of various imprecisely based criteria. Also, uncertainty is an unavoidable part of the information in the decision-making process and its importance in the selection process is relatively high and needs to be carefully considered. Consequently, incomplete and inadequate data or information may occur among other various selection criteria, which can be termed as a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem. Interval rough numbers are very flexible to model this type of uncertainty occurring in MCDM problems. Thus this paper presents a new integrated interval rough number (IRN) approach based on the Best Worst Method (BWM) and Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment (WASPAS) method along Multi-Attributive Border Approximation area Comparison (MABAC) to evaluate 3PL providers. The hybrid IRN-BWM based methodology is used for computing the priority weights of criteria while IRN-WASPAS and IRN-MABAC are employed to achieve the final ranking of 3PL providers. A computational study is performed to illustrate the proposed approaches along with a sensitivity analysis on different sets of criteria weight coefficient values to validate the stability of the suggested methodology. Consequently, a comparative analysis of the obtained ranking results with their crisp and fuzzy counterparts is also conducted for checking the reliability of the proposed approach. The results display stability in ranking of alternative results and prove the feasibility of the proposed approach to handle MCDM problems with IRNs.}

For that reason, it is necessary to develop an assessment method that has an integrative scope and identifies the risk profiles in animals. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to detect cattle welfare indicators that can be implemented at the slaughterhouse level and to develop integrated risk profiles based on the animal’s origin, pre-slaughter logistics, and animal-based indicators. We recorded the origin, commercial category, transportation details, and horn size of 1040 cattle upon arrival at the slaughterhouse. Cattle welfare was measured based on individual scores for vocalizations, stunning shots, carcass bruises, meat pH, severe hoof injuries, and organ condemnations. To characterize operational and logistic practices from the farm to the slaughterhouse, a two-step cluster analysis was applied to the aforementioned variables (production system, cattle type, horn size, journey distance, vehicle type), which identified four clusters: small feedlot and free-range profile (C1, n = 216, 20.8 %), feedlot profile (C2, n = 193, 18.6 %), culled dairy cows profile (C3, n = 262, 25.2 %), and free-range profile (C4, n = 369, 35.5 %). The animal’s diet and environmental conditions might have influenced the development of hoof disorders in C1 animals (P = 0.023), the proportion of animals that were re-shot was highest in C2 animals (P = 0.033), and C3 and C4 animals were most likely to suffer injuries such as severe bruising (P = 0.001). In addition, the number of stunning shots, meat pH, carcass bruises, severe hoof injuries, and liver condemnations, explained a significant variation in the incidence of various health and welfare consequences based on an animal’s origin, which confirmed their importance as ‘welfare iceberg’ indicators. The study provided detailed data that can be included into assessment methods for the welfare of slaughter cattle, which can be tailored to specific production systems.}

abstract = {Humanitarian assistance is meant to save lives and alleviate human suffering during and in the aftermath of man-made and natural disasters. To prevent and strengthen preparedness for the occurrence of such situations, having available relief supplies in the short-term becomes crucial. The lack of access to life-sustaining items implies a loss in people's welfare, treated as an externality called deprivation costs which must be incorporated into decision-making processes. Since typical humanitarian applications are extensions of commercial logistic models, they usually do not account for externalities, leading to high social costs and likely to unfeasible or suboptimal solutions. This paper develops a facility location model for prepositioning supplies in preparation for disasters; the key feature of this formulation being the fact that it explicitly considers deprivation costs in the objective function. The model attempts to minimize the global social costs, as the sum of both private costs (i.e. costs of transportation, inventory costs and fixed costs of facilities) and deprivation costs, determining the amount per type of product to be prepositioned for serving the areas affected by a disaster during the initial response. The model focuses on those assistance interventions that should be carried out immediately, i.e. within the first 24 h of a humanitarian crisis. We applied the model, using real information, to the Colombian Caribbean region, which was affected by floods in 2010 and 2011. Results demonstrate that deprivation costs represent more than 50% of the total social cost.}

The study is motivated by the practical issues faced by the e-waste reverse logistics (RL) network, which requires micro-level estimation for various activities such as facility location, routing of vehicles, resource allocation, and capacity determination. Taking input as population, and product penetration, due to the unavailability of sales data at the micro-level, we propose an e-waste estimation approach based on the sales-stock-lifespan model. Considering product diffusion follows an 'S' shaped curve, the time-series expansion is modelled using the Gompertz curve and percentage change in mobile subscribers. We show that the waste from obsolete mobile phones increased exponentially from 2004 till 2019, i.e., 1147 in 2004–856483 in 2019, and is expected to be stable with less than 1% growth rate till 2030. We also show that Delhi will discard approximately 858611 mobile phones in the year 2020, and the top 5 e-waste generating wards-villages of Delhi will produce 13089, 6502, 5901, 5863, and 5742 obsolete mobile phones in 2020.

abstract = {In the typical structure of the supply chains associated with the Asia-Europe container trade, containers are stuffed in China, and the cargo is subsequently cross-docked at a major European logistics hub or a distribution centre closer to the customer for further distribution to the final retailing points. However, this solution may not be optimal in the perspective of total logistics cost. Upstream buyer consolidation at the origin and a downstream rail-based intermodal system at the destination has been regarded as a potential solution for reducing the costs of supply chains. The purpose of this study is to identify the benefits of this potential solution. This research is based on a case study obtained from a Swedish retailer with a chain of retailing points in Scandinavia and Poland. A comparative analysis is used to reveal the cost advantage of the alternative solution. Our findings suggest that this alternative solution may reduce monetary logistics cost from two aspects: converting LCL shipments to FCL shipments and converting almost full 20-foot FCL shipments to 40-foot FCL shipments. In addition, certain non-monetary benefits of buyer consolidation, including reduced possibility of delay, reduced complexity, reduced carbon emissions and reduced activities in the destination countries, are illustrated in this paper. Based on our calculation, the cost-saving potential of the new alternative solution illustrated in this case study is considerable, which suggests that such solutions might be desirable as an alternative to the typical arrangements in this trade.}

abstract = {With Germany's nuclear phase-out, 23 reactors need to be dismantled in the near future. Initiated by the difficult financial situation of affected utilities in 2014, a major discourse on ensuring financial liability led to a redistribution of liabilities and finances, with the utilities remaining in charge of dismantling, while liability for interim and final storage now transferred to the public. This paper assesses whether the new regulation is ultimately likely to be to the benefit of the public. It introduces a two-stage stochastic optimization framework encompassing the different dismantling phases, resulting waste flows and storage levels of low- and intermediate-level waste (LLW and ILW) as well as the associated costs. Results show that storage risk – proclaimed as a major barrier to efficient decommissioning – is not a major driver for the optimal decommissioning schedule. However, a delay of ten years might increase interim storage costs now borne by the public by over 20%. Lacking experience and handling capacity of the industry could significantly shrink the buffer currently included in utility funds in order to deal with dismantling uncertainties. Our analysis reveals the storage gate as the new crucial interface between utilities and the public storage provider.}

Meanwhile, the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solutions (TOPSIS) is used to rank alternative decision-making schemes. Moreover, the ordering is also carried out using the Additive Weighting, Weighted Product and Elimination et Choice Translating Reality (ELECTRE) method. In this study, the DEA-TOPSIS method is used to make multi-attribute decisions about industry efficiency. Taking Shanghai's ELV industry as an example, this study utilizes 2017 data from seven member-enterprises of the Shanghai End-of-life Vehicle Professional Committee; it uses the DEA-TOPSIS method based on TES to conduct an empirical study on multi-attribute decision making to improve efficiency and analyze efficiency improvement through alternative decision-making schemes. The findings show that the DEA-TOPSIS method based on TES is effective for multi-attribute decision-making to improve the ELV reverse logistics industry's efficiency. The multi-attribute decision-making in this paper facilitates the management and investment decision making of the ELV recycling industry. It also provides an effective solution for managers and researchers in the ELV industry to improve its efficiency.}

We review the adaptation to the North American setting of certain original JIT procedures. These include use of a “JIT warehouse” when suppliers and assembly plant are further apart. Logistics operations are shown to benefit from the JIT viewpoint regarding new technologies such as the Internet of Things. We discuss the effects of JIT on both inbound and outbound flows at a given supply chain node. The impact of JIT on rail transportation is considered. Today's increased awareness toward sustainability argues for the emergence of JIT Logistics in service-oriented industries.}

Increasing the demand for smart regional logistics in terms of quality and quantity demands industrialization and strengthening economic sectors. The Internet of Things is a future technology that can provide many innovative solutions for the modernization of economic sectors. Research institutes and research groups continue to work hard to provide solutions and products to solve various financial problems using the Internet of Things. The Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)-based embedded Internet of Things (IoT) system is the preferred communication source for the regional intelligent logistics labor market balancing system to balance marketability and flexibility in the economic field. In the local smart logistics market, labor can be received as a commodity. The financial sector has achieved a balance between these labor markets in various uses of the non-logistics labor market, usually with intermediaries pushing labor to market groups and relocating it elsewhere. Workers and employers work with the labor market. Guiding regional intelligent logic economic market analysis, currency boundaries affect the low and high performance of registrations. The logistics market has established equilibrium conditions to reveal the swirling effects of currency fluctuations caused by reserves use. The balancing method in the smart logistics market shows the immediate and bypassing impact of rural sector profits on revenue performance, revenue value, and investment in use, revenue, and salary strategies. The traditional MIP structure is modified to avoid resource conflicts with Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) components. The essential concepts for designing this type of Million Instructions per Second (MIPS) include core, and its implementation effects are analyzed.

abstract = {Traffic congestion problems are very common in large municipalities, especially in areas with karst features. Traffic jams happen in many key traffic nodes (such as the bridges across the river and the tunnels through the mountains) frequently, which may lead to severe challenges for the vehicle routing optimization. To effectively solve the routing problem of Cash-in-Transit (CIT) sectors, this study aims to establish a novel bi-objective Cash-in-Transit Vehicle Routing Problem (CTVRP) model, including both the economic and environmental objectives, and designs a Nearest Neighbor-first Iterated Local Search-second algorithm (NN-ILS) with the consideration of the special terrain. Then, a case study of a CIT company is performed to demonstrate the model and algorithm and a vivid solution is presented in real road network after the optimization by using the route fitting procedure. Meanwhile, the accuracy and effectiveness of the algorithm is verified by comparing it with several classical algorithms and OR-Tools solver. The experimental results show that the developed algorithm can help the decision-makers to obtain the solutions with high quality compared with the classical algorithms. Finally, the uncertainty of the developed algorithm is analyzed empirically and the Multi-Attribute Decision Making (MADM) combined with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is utilized to support decision-makers to select the best satisfying solution instead of choosing the solution with minimum objective value(s).}

It is performed taking into account specific evaluation criteria and indicators. This study aims to introduce a holistic sustainability-based framework for the assessment of logistics solutions based on Life Cycle Sustainability Analysis (LCSA) and multi stakeholder multi criteria decision making concept by considering four sustainability disciplines (economy, environment, mobility and society) and three enablers (solution maturity, user acceptance and user uptake). The followed process builds on data transparency and stakeholder communication, and enables decision making through aggregation of the analysis results. Evalog, an open platform, has been developed based on the framework concepts and is implemented to assess and cross-compare city logistics solutions that have been selected by twelve European city cases. The output of Evalog is the integration of all indicators in the Logistics Sustainability Index (LSI), which depicts the solution’s impact per stakeholder category and the Global LSI (GLSI), which represents the overall impact at city level. Results showed that an average improvement of 24.5% may be achieved in all criteria and city cases owing to the logistics solution.}

abstract = {Network design plays an essential role in logistics supply chain management. Under fourth-party logistics (4PL), an industry innovator mode helps to balance the service satisfaction of both suppliers and customers. In this study, this “balancing” advantage is investigated, and a novel network is proposed for 4PL platforms. Specifically, a mixed-integer nonlinear programming model is developed to maximize the service satisfaction of both sides under a limited budget, and to determine the locations for transshipment centers (TCs), third-party logistics (3PL) providers between parties, and transport volumes. The service satisfaction is defined according to prospect theory. Considering the NP-hard characteristic of the problem and its complicated objective function, a particle swarm optimization plus (PSO+) algorithm integrating an average adjustment (AA) strategy is introduced for managing complex budget constraints. A series of numerical experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the model and algorithm. The results provide strong evidence for certifying the performance of the model, in which both suppliers and customers can achieve their anticipated service levels.}

In this problem, we select delivery centers that are accessible for all customers and determine the optimal delivery route that minimizes the costs proportional to the distance traveled by the delivery vehicle, the delivery time, and costs. This is an extension of the traveling salesman problem with a time window constraint, which simultaneously determines the locations of the delivery centers for customer pickup and the delivery route. To solve this problem and to improve managerial practice, we propose a mathematical programming model and an efficient two-phase solution algorithm based on an ant colony heuristic that is better suited to reality. By addressing on-demand delivery optimization problems, shipping companies can guarantee customer satisfaction while reducing shipping costs.}

In this work, optimization models and techniques in humanitarian logistics are introduced, paying special attention to evacuation and last mile distribution problems. Most of these problems try to transport people and goods in the most efficient and effective manner, giving way to complex problems where heuristic approaches have to be used and several criteria must be considered.}

abstract = {Collaboration in emergency logistics can be beneficial for governmental actors when supply chains need to be set up immediately. In comparison to research on humanitarian-business partnerships, the body of literature on so-called Public–Private Emergency Collaborations (PPEC) remains scarce. Private companies are only rarely considered within research on emergency collaborations, although they serve as an important chain in the efficient supply of goods given their resources and existing communication networks. Based on this research gap, we contribute to the research field by quantitatively evaluating public–private collaboration in emergency logistics. A framework for public–private emergency collaborations is developed based on logistical and game-theoretical concepts. In addition, we characterize both public and private actors’ possible roles in emergency logistics based on literature research and real cases. Furthermore, we provide a structured overview on existing PPECs and the challenges they are confronted with. The game-theoretic PPEC model created in this paper provides more detailed information into the motivation and incentives of the partners involved in emergency collaborations. Inspired by game-theoretic accounts of conventional public–private partnerships, this model sheds light on the partners’ participation constraints (which define the scope of collaboration), the effects on the outcome if the partners’ contributions are strategic substitutes, and on reputational effects. Finally, we illustrate how a mechanism design approach can be used by the state to transform the firm’s incentives into lower levels of undersupply or deprivation.}

Forecasting and inventory models for aviation logistics are essential in commercial aviation. The objective of this paper is to study the problem of identifying the optimal order quantity of aircraft spare parts and the demand periods using the Order-Up-To (OUT) inventory model in conjunction with the Negative Binomial Distribution (NBD) and the (s, S) inventory model with Revised Power Approximation Method. These models are compared and contrasted via a real-world paradigm. The analysis reveals that the OUT inventory model in conjunction with the Poisson distribution allows ordering the lowest order quantity. However, the (s, S) inventory model with the Revised Power Approximation outperforms it in terms of average total inventory costs.}
