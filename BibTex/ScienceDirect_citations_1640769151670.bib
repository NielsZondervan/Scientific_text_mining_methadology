abstract = {The new global economy framework is characterised by strategic economic centres formed around networks of goods, financial and information flows that constitute the today's social morphology of our societies. In this scenario almost every international company or firm develops its own structure and positioning plan by evaluating the business opportunities linked to each possible future branch office. Of course, the way to do business differs a lot considering that can be affected by customs, language, culture, laws, geography, infrastructures and business mind-set for instance and this is why developing a strong relation between the main headquarters and the world spread company's offices has become needful for a company to be successful. The shipping sector is not an exception, on the contrary all the shipping companies, especially the liner ones, due to the nature of their business are forced to establish regional offices to cover the global market. In particular, this analysis has been conducted with a focus on the Mediterranean and on the different positioning strategies adopted by one of the biggest liner carrier in the world, the German company Hapag-Lloyd. The present research tries to answer to following questions: • How do World City Networks and AMPS (Advanced Maritime Producer Services) affect a liner shipping company's positioning plan and how does it work in the Mediterranean?• Which variables does a big carrier take into consideration planning its network?• Which steps have to be followed entering a new market?}

abstract = {A survey of Mexico-based sheep hauliers was conducted in order to investigate perceptions and attitudes toward farm animal welfare (FAW) and their influence on operational and logistic practices (OLPs) in sheep transportation. The statistical analysis consisted in the application of 2-factor analyses (OLP and animal welfare attitudes), additionally a cluster analysis; the latter allowed a segmentation of hauliers according to their attitudes and OLP. The factor analysis gave 3 OLP factors: logistic issues, economic losses, and welfare losses. In the case of factor analyses about animal welfare attitudes, we obtained 4 factors: training and regulations, animal needs, welfare improvement, and sensibility. The cluster analysis of this study showed the existence of 3 haulier profiles; these were “efficient and concerned,” “efficient and not concerned,” and “not efficient and concerned.” Our results showed that hauliers' perceptions had a clear influence on the performance of their operative and logistic activities during the sheep transportation. This study highlights the individual hauliers' risk factors which can be considered to improve not only animal welfare but also indicates the need to consider the transportation as a whole because of potential factor combinations and confusions. The attitudes of sheep hauliers toward FAW are a strategic component that requires being considered when hauliers are trained. If it can be shown that modifying hauliers' attitudes leads to improved OLP, then there is an opportunity to develop specific training programs to modify certain haulier's animal welfare attitudes, with a subsequent improvement of sheep welfare.}

The integration of user-centered design, social innovation, portable devices, and sensors may have a role in influencing people's choices and consumption patterns. The paper presents two ongoing works that investigate, design and develop tools for valuing people's positive behaviors and rewarding choices in the domain of mobility and energy. The objective of such tools is both to raise people's awareness and to engage it into a collaborative environment, in order to meet a common set of targets. The strategy adopted in both the cases is based on linking “bottom-up” with “top-down” approach, i.e. by making people to behave and to make choices coordinately with decision maker's (i.e. the Public Administration or the Administrator of the system) objectives. The first regards Opti-LOG, a project co-funded by Regione Lombardia under the Smart Cities and Communities program, which concerns last-mile delivery with low emission and zero emission vehicles. The second case regards Sharing Cities, a H2020 project that includes a pilot project in the Municipality of Milano, where the focus is on citizen engagement and behaviors in the domains of personal mobility and energy. The system, by enabling mechanisms of collaboration, sharing and human capital generation, tackles the objectives of lowering energy consumption and promoting sustainable mobility and contributes to the weaving of a more cohesive social tissue.}

Capacity Management – such as fleeting becomes one of the critical decisions for the logistic company. Despite its role to ensure the availability of fleet as needed with an effective and efficient process, a good capacity management can improve service level and lead to competitive advantage. However, due to its capital-intensive characteristic, the decision between buying and renting a fleet becomes an important consideration. Therefore, this study presents a comprehensive decision-making methodology in capacity management, particularly on fleet procurement by incorporating several techniques (i.e., Demand forecasting, Demand-capacity analysis, Analytic Hierarchy Process with BOCR model, Urgent-Important Eisenhower Matrix, and Simulation). A numerical example is performed to an Indonesian logistic company. It reveals that a combination of owned-fleet and rented-fleet becomes the most appropriate strategy. In general, this study has contributed to strengthening existing literature and providing a comprehensive methodology in capacity management.}

Young people are significant generators of home deliveries and, when clustered in university halls of residence, can generate considerable freight traffic to one location. This paper explores the potential to consolidate these deliveries using an urban consolidation centre. Based on the case of Southampton, UK, data were compiled from three linked sources: a delivery audit of four halls of residence at the University of Southampton housing 5050 residents; annual package receipt records from Southampton Solent University halls (2294 residents); and an online shopping survey distributed to Southampton University students (486 responses). The results suggest that in cities with multiple higher education institutions (HEIs), where in excess of 8000 students live in halls, over 13,000 courier trips could be generated annually, delivering over 4000m3 of packages. These could be consolidated onto fewer than 300 vehicles for an annual service cost of approximately £18 per student, reducing congestion, parking infringements and improving air quality. Analysis indicated student acceptance of a consolidated parcel service but operational challenges would include enforcement, performance risk, finance and delivery speed.}

Uptimes can be managed by both improving the maintenance decision making as well as considering appropriate service supply chain design decisions. Furthermore, the integration of Industry 4.0 tools can further boost the previous with its communication and connectivity ability. Knowledge on these aspects is available in academia as well as in practice, but, as this paper argues, not structured for making decisions that consider all of these aspects in an integrated way aiming at improving equipment uptime. Through literature review, we assess the existing literature on IPS2. In doing so this paper offers a two-fold contribution: On the one hand, it presents an exploratory literature review to identify knowledge gap and on the other hand, it proposes a suitable future research project.}

abstract = {Background
Clinical tumor (T), node, and metastasis staging is based on a qualitative assessment of features defining T descriptors and has been found to be suboptimal for predicting the prognosis of patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). Previous work suggests that volumetric computed tomography (VolCT) is prognostic and, if found practical and reproducible, could improve clinical MPM classification.
Methods
Six North American institutions electronically submitted clinical, pathologic, and imaging data on patients with stages I to IV MPM to an established multicenter database and biostatistical center. Two reference radiologists blinded to clinical data independently reviewed the scans; calculated clinical T, node, and metastasis stage by standard criteria; performed semiautomated tumor volume calculations using commercially available software; and submitted the findings to the biostatistical center. Study end points included the feasibility of a multi-institutional VolCT network, concordance of independent VolCT assessments, and association of VolCT with pathological T classification.
Results
Of 164 submitted cases, 129 were evaluated by both reference radiologists. Discordant clinical staging of most cases confirmed the inadequacy of current criteria. The overall correlation between VolCT estimates was good (Spearman correlation 0.822), but some were significantly discordant. Root cause analysis of the most discordant estimates identified four common sources of variability. Despite these limitations, median tumor volume estimates were similar within subgroups of cases representing each pathological T descriptor and increased monotonically for each reference radiologist with increasing pathological T status.
Conclusions
The good correlation between VolCT estimates obtained for most cases reviewed by two independent radiologists and qualitative association of VolCT with pathological T status combine to encourage further study. The identified sources of user error will inform design of a follow-up prospective trial to more formally assess interobserver variability of VolCT and its potential contribution to clinical MPM staging.}

This problem is further exacerbated when individuals are not available for detection during some surveys due to limited access, delaying surveys and creating mismatches between the breeding behavior and survey timing. Here we use simulations to explore the impacts of this issue using four hypothetical boreal toad (Anaxyrus boreas boreas) populations, representing combinations of logistical access (accessible, inaccessible) and breeding behavior (synchronous, asynchronous). We examine the bias and precision of survival and breeding probability estimates generated by survey designs that differ in effort and timing for these populations. Our findings indicate that the logistical access of a site and mismatch between the breeding behavior and survey design can greatly limit the ability to yield accurate and precise estimates of survival and breeding probabilities. Simulations similar to what we have performed can help researchers determine an optimal survey design(s) for their system before initiating sampling efforts.}

Transport costs depend on many factors- purchase price of the vehicle, labor costs of the drivers, costs of maintenance and repairs, fuel costs etc. Hence, it is so important to find organizational solutions that can reduce the costs associated with the transportation of postal shipments, thereby reducing the total cost of postal services. An excellent way for doing it is to minimize the length of postal transportation routes, what means finding the shortest ways between post offices in selected area. This article presents the results of analysis and researches on existing postal network, which were based on the graph theory, in order to optimize actual network. Realized computer simulations were oriented to find a new location of the local distribution center. The relocation of local distribution center leads to minimize of the transport costs for delivery postal items “from point to point” of Polish Post SA network in the selected area of the Lublin province.}

abstract = {Current refugee crisis challenges mental health care systems all over the Europe. There is a number of research describing difficulties in dealing with cross-cultural patients. Access to relevant care as well as its availability are often limited due to: a) lack of respective qualified resources b) linguistically, cultural and even racial barriers in addressing of mental health care needs of cross-cultural patient population. By use of various e-Mental health applications, primarily videoconference, we may improve assessment and/or treatment of refugees and asylum seekers on distance e.g. Arabic speaking psychiatrist located in Sweden would be able to assess and/or treat refugees from Syria located in Germany). Specialized centers for treatment of refugees would also be able to get second-opinion service from remote experts and use it in order to confirm or re-consider diagnosis as well as the treatment options. Establishment of international network of cross-cultural experts enables to: – Improve the mental health care across national boundaries by providing psychiatric consultations to other countries within EU – Conduct International Treatment Team with Select Skills (e.g. Sign Language and Many Foreign Languages Staff) – Provide Distance Supervision and Staff Consultation – Provide Psycho Education of caregivers – Improve Distance Learning via Case Conferencing and Best Practice Demonstration Across the National Boundaries – Create Data Base over cross-cultural and other select skills professionals within EU}

A two-step methodology is structured using fuzzy AHP and fuzzy TOPSIS to evaluate pre-positioned warehouse locations for humanitarian relief organisations. The empirical case study analysis of a humanitarian relief organisation is conducted to illustrate the use of the proposed framework for ranking alternative locations. This framework provides a more accurate, effective, and systematic decision support tool for stepwise implementation of warehouse location selection in humanitarian relief operations to increase efficiency. National stability is considered the most crucial factor for warehouse selection followed by host country cooperation. Location A was identified as the optimal warehouse location, with Locations D and E being relatively close. However, the organisation operates at Location A due to the national stability and government incentives such as land costs and customs exemption.}

The differences between the cited concepts are generally minor, substantially greater difficulties arise, however, in measuring the characteristics of the sustainability of transport, not only in the base - by analyzing the indicators, but especially in a multidimensional system aimed at exploring the relationship between the characteristics chosen to describe sustainable transport. The aim of this paper is to identify and select indicators repeated in different strategic documents describing sustainable transport, then study the spatial coherence selected for the study of these indicators and conduct an analysis of relations between the identified areas of sustainable transport. In the available literature, the results of such analyses to date are based mainly on the analysis of sustainability of individual indicators. Much less attention has been devoted to the study of interactions between the indicated areas. In this paper, the vector calculus method is applied.}

abstract = {Background
Prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) is used as an alternative to fresh frozen plasma (FFP) for emergency bleeding. The primary objective of this study was to compare the time from order to start of administration between 3-factor PCC (PCC3), 4-factor (PCC4), and FFP in the emergency department (ED). The secondary objective was to evaluate the effect of an ED pharmacist on time to administration of PCCs.
Methods
This was a single center three-arm retrospective cohort study. Adult patients in the ED with bleeding were included. The primary outcome measure was the time from order to administration, which was compared between PCC3, PCC4, and FFP. The time from order to administration was also compared when the ED pharmacist was involved versus not involved in the care of patients receiving PCC.
Results
There were 90 patients included in the study cohort (30 in each group). The median age was 69years (IQR 57–82years), and 57% (n=52) were male. The median time from order to administration was 36min (IQR 20–58min) for PCC3, 34min (IQR 18–48min) for PCC4, and 92min (IQR 63–133) for FFP (PCC3 versus PCC4, p=0.429; PCC3 versus FFP, p<0.001; PCC4 versus FFP, p<0.001). The median time from order to administration was significantly decreased when the ED pharmacist was involved (24min [IQR 15–35min] versus 42min [IQR 32–59min], p<0.001).
Conclusions
Time from order to administration is faster with PCC than FFP. ED pharmacist involvement decreases the time from order to administration of PCC.}

abstract = {The increase of customized products and the associated decrease in batch size as well as a rising variance of required parts lead to more complex material supply processes. Additionally, the customer places an increasing emphasis on meeting delivery dates as well as on shorter delivery times which both require especially reliable and efficient logistics processes. One approach to increase the efficiency is the transfer of lean thinking to logistics processes, which implies a reduction of waste. Currently, only basic approaches to apply lean production methods to logistics exist. Literature review shows that they are insufficient as they don’t detect reasons for waste systematically and give advices to reduce it. The focus of this article is therefore the development of a tool for quantifying value-added shares in material supply as a main task of logistics. First, it is examined to what extent logistics activities can generally be classified as value-adding. Subsequently, the Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) analysis, which is so far used to evaluate the efficiency of production systems, is transferred to commissioning as one part of the material supply process. The value-added shares of commissioning are identified and reasons for losses are discussed. Finally, a case study in the Process Learning Factory CiP validates the approach. Through the application of this tool, it is possible to identify losses and thus increase the efficiency of logistics processes.}

In this revolution, cloud manufacturing has a critical role as a major pillar. The idea behind the cloud manufacturing concept is establishing a cloud manufacturing platform, which aggregates distributed manufacturing resources, then transforms them into manufacturing services, and manages them in a centralized manner. One of the critical aspects of this centralized management is scheduling of the tasks. The scheduling problem of single/multiple tasks is previously considered in cloud computing transactions, but the structure of this problem is different in cloud manufacturing, regarding logistic aspects. In this paper, a brief review over the prior researches related to the task scheduling in cloud computing and cloud manufacturing is presented. This model is capable of addressing to main types of sharing in cloud manufacturing systems known as operation sharing and logistic sharing. Next, the paper presents a basic model for task scheduling problem in cloud manufacturing systems; and by using an illustrative example the validation and verification of the proposed model are examined. Finally, the paper discusses the results, concludes the remarks and presents the roadmap of the future researches.}

In this paper, we have developed an integrated Geographic Information System (GIS) based sustainable biomass assessment, site optimization and supply logistics cost model to assess the spatial and temporal availability of crop residues, to identify optimal plant sites and to calculate the delivered cost. The grid-level (30×30m) assessment model was developed for crop residues using three primary sustainability indicators: (1) Soil Erosion (SE), (2) Soil Conditioning Index (SCI) and (3) Crop residue yield ⩾2.5dryMg/ha. The Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) prediction models for each indicator were developed and implemented in the GIS platform to assess sustainably available crop residues. A multi-criteria geospatial analysis was used to identify suitable plant sites. GIS-based location-allocation model was used to site biorefineries/plants at optimal locations and generate feedstock supply curves. The developed model was demonstrated with the sustainable assessment of cotton stalk (CS) to produce fuel pellets in the study region (Georgia, USA). The model has estimated that about 1.6milliondryMg of CS is available annually to support seven pellet plants with an average annual plant capacity of 200,000dryMg. The average delivered cost of CS ranged between 68 and 75$/dryMg delivered as large rectangular bales with the transport radii ranged from 31 to 60km. The spatial and temporal variations in the topology and crop yield directly influenced the sustainable availability of CS, the optimal plant location and its capacity and the delivered cost. However, the changes in the optimal plant location and delivered cost were minimal for large capacity plants (>400,000dryMg). The developed model can be used to assess multiple crop residues, to manage and control feedstock supply risks and delivered cost variations for a sustainable biorefinery.}

CellSearch-enirched CTCs from patients with metastatic castration–resistant prostate cancer were characterized by RT-qPCR. After optimization, it was prospectively tested whether it was possible to report the AR-V7 status within 11 days (PRELUDE study). In the range of the RNA equivalent of 0.2 to 12 VCaP cells, the CV for AR-V7 was 9% (n = 37). The limit of detection was 0.3, and the limit of quantitation was 3 cells in the final RT-qPCR. No differences were observed between AR-V7 data generated by five technicians or in two different laboratories. For the 45 patients in PRELUDE, 13 patients were ineligible, 22 patients were AR-V7 negative, and 10 were AR-V7 positive. The median time to inform the physician of the test result was 7 days (range, 2 to 11 days). This assay can establish the AR-V7 status in CTCs from patients with metastatic castration–resistant prostate cancer. Furthermore, it was possible to provide an AR-V7 outcome within 11 days, indicating that it may be used to choose between an anti–androgen receptor or taxane-based cabazitaxel treatment.}

The study is intended to assist in decision making in a fresh apple processing plant in order to ensure its annual supply. First, a fresh produce purchasing model is proposed to minimize purchasing costs, producer administration costs and costs for transport to the classification center while taking into consideration the fresh produce offered by each producer, storage capacity and the type of storage for the fruit. These parameters will aid in selecting the producers providing the best price-storage time-distance combination for the purchase. Second, a fresh produce storage model is proposed for minimizing the cost of storage and transport to the classification center (located in the actual processing plant) for each fresh product purchased. Finally, a third integrated model is proposed to give a joint solution to purchasing, transporting and storing the fresh produce. The models are applied in a real case study in an apple dehydration plant in the Maule region of Chile, where average savings were obtained of about 8% with respect to the real costs of purchasing, storing and transporting the fresh produce during the processing period.}

The system is composed by two elements: (a) a “sea-to-grid” technological component harvesting and producing electrical energy from sea waves; and (b) a “green” logistic service based on the use of Fully Electric Vehicles (FEVs). A pilot study will be conducted near an Italian port area supporting passengers and freight mobility between a port and a backward (sub)-urban area. The proposed system is within the environmental goals set by the EU (Europe 2020 Strategy) and the Italian Government (National Energy Masterplan). Indeed, the energy-producing technology reduces dependence from traditional energy sources (coal, gas, oil) and consequently reduces their negative effects (greenhouse gases, air pollution, etc.). Considering that the energy is produced by sea waves, the system transfers the entire amount of produced (green) energy to the electric vehicles. The system will be experimented in a medium size urbanized area and the energy will be produced in a small size port.}

abstract = {Device therapy for conduction abnormalities, heart failure, primary or secondary SCD preventions is under delivered to requiring patients. Most of these devices are implanted at tertiary care centers in major cities of most countries. This makes the availability of these guideline guided therapies to a very small percentage of needy patients. Implant of such devices at a secondary hospital (without a cardiac cath lab) with training of previously novice hospital staff and available resources as well as support of the industry is an alternative and very viable option to have such important therapy delivered to requiring patients. The usage of simple-readily available-C-arm in operating theatre (OR) or the interventional radiology suite can be utilized for this purpose. OR nursing staff and radiology technicians can be trained –with help of nursing education department– to help in such procedures over a relatively short period. Technical support utilized from the vendors representatives is an alternative to face the lack of EP technicians in local or international market. The follow up of these patients in OPD can be organized with help of the vendors on regular basis under supervision of trained cardiologist/s. This model can help establish device therapy service at a secondary hospital without huge expenditure on infrastructure or facing the lack of recruitment of specialized technical support that is difficult to find –especially for smaller cities–. We present our experience at a 250 bed secondary hospital, with a relatively small cardiac unit (3 consultants, 5 hospitalists, 10 cardiac ECG/Echo techs) and no cath lab of introduction of this service with the help of nursing education department and vendors supplying these devices as well as OR and radiology departments. Training of radiology technicians and OR nursing staff on the basic procedural support with few in-service demonstration helped prepare adequate staff helping during implant procedures. Requirement of technical support from the vendor –as a condition for purchase of devices– during the implant and follow up clinics helped overcome the lack of EP technicians. After implant of more than 100 different devices (pacemakers, AICD and BiV-AICD) the process became much smoother and easier. A total of 106 procedures (including insertion of PPM, AICD, BiV-AICD and loop recorders, battery change, etc.) were carried out from the start of the program. The immediate complication rate was 6.6% (2 pneumothorax, 1 CS dissection, 1 hematoma, 1 lead dislodgement, 1 lidocaine toxicity, 1 PEA) with no mortality. 1.8% (2 patients) required intubation during the procedure (lidocaine toxicity, PEA). No device infection related to procedure (upto 6 months) was noticed. Device implant programs can be established with relatively low cost for institutions without cardiac cath lab. In an era of controlling the spiraling costs of medical care, cutting the cost while delivering the guideline guided therapy to needy patients is possible. Our experience can be replicated with success at other smaller centers facing similar challenges.}

We also calculate the pipeline volumetric break-even point yielding the minimum CO2 volume required from a specific site for pipeline to become the less costly transport option and finally, we investigate the effect injectivity may have on the choice of reservoir and transport mode. Most stationary CO2-emissions in the Nordic region originate from emission intensive industries such as steel, cement and chemical plants and refineries. Typically, their emissions are modest (less than 1 Mt per year) compared to large coal fired power plants, while distances to potential storage sites are considerable, often 300km or more. Hence, build-up of clusters of emission sources and CO2-volumes is likely to take time and be costly. At the same time, many of the emission sources, both fossil based and biogenic, are located along the coast line. The results imply that due to modest CO2-volumes and relatively long transport distances CO2 transport by ship is the least costly transportation option for most of the sources individually as well as for most of the potential cluster combinations during ramp-up of the CCS transport and storage infrastructure. It is furthermore shown that cost of ship transport increases modestly with increasing transport distance which, in combination with poor injectivity in reservoirs in the Baltic Sea, indicate that it may be less costly to transport the CO2 captured from Finnish and Swedish sources located along the Baltic Sea a further 800-1300km to the west by ship for storage in aquifers with higher injectivity in the Skagerrak region or in the North Sea.}

In doing so, we present a mathematical model of the city logistics platform to specify location-allocation problem. Our model considers both flows: urban freight and reverse logistics. Subsequently, we improve city logistics platform’s financial situation by reducing operating costs. Finally, we use a numerical algorithm for optimization and illustration purposes.}

Integration of timber and energy supply chains helps overcome the challenge of seasonal fluctuations in energy demand, by offering greater and more consistent use of machine capacity. Quality management of harvested biomass has become a very important issue in recent years. As supply volumes have increased, the economic losses associated with poor storage management have become obvious. Energy yields per unit of delivered biomass can be maximised through careful establishment and location of storage, prediction and measurement of changing moisture content, as well as the ability to match supply with demand. Research shows that the use of biomass quality and location data to schedule wood chipping and transportation can markedly reduce the fleet size required to transport wood chips during periods of peak demand and the use of transport capacity through the year. Quality management becomes even more important when value-added products are made from biomass. Producers of higher-value end products are willing to pay a premium price for good quality feedstock and their needs should be considered when handling forest biomass, in order to gain and maintain a competitive advantage. Biomass projects should target areas where market-driven competitiveness is best and where economic sustainability can be achieved with modest incentives.}

From the process network down to the product distribution side, there are definitions on the assignments and amounts of distillates to be dispatched downstream for further process- and blend-shops considering diverse tank farms and nodes for the distribution. However, such integration of the refining process and tank storage systems can become intractable for industrial-sized problems with complex scheduling configurations considering time-varying rundown supply rates, product demands and pricing. For this, we propose to model the dispositions of distillates using unit-operations as modes of transportation from the distillation sources to the tanks of process-shops and blend-shops for downstream processing and blending before the primary distribution. Additionally, by solving with pooling (groups of tanks) first then post-solve to depool by disaggregating the pooled solution, the determination of the distillate dispositions to tank assignments is facilitated given that scaling to industrial-sized cases without tank aggregation is complicated as highlighted in the examples. Better prediction of the operations scheduling by using small discrete time-steps within a planning horizon allows opportunities for exploring the contract and spot market plays of the finished products.}

To approach this goal with greener design, a novel server backup strategy is adopted with two types of standby server with warm standby and cold standby configurations. On such two-level standby scheme, cost elaboration has been explored in terms of deployment ratio between warm standbys and cold standbys. The cold standbys provide a greener power solution than those of conventional warm standbys. The optimal cost policy has been proposed to maintain regulated quality of service for the cloud customers. On qualitative study, a Petri net is developed and designed to visualize the whole system operational flow. On quantitative research for decision support, the theory of finite source queue is elaborated and relevant comprehensive mathematical analysis on cost pattern has been made in detail. Relevant simulations have been conducted to validate the proposed cost optimization model as well. On green contribution, the saving of power consumption has been estimated on the basis of switching warm standbys into cold standbys, which amounts for the reduction of CO2 emission. Hence the proposed approach indeed provides a feasibly standby architecture to meet cloud logistic economy with greener deployment.}

In Turkey, recovery of ELVs is regulated with Regulation About Controlling of ELVs which was issued by the Turkish Republic Ministry of Environment and Forestry in Official Gazette in 2009. Manufacturers are responsible for free take-back of ELVs from end-users, depolluting, dismantling, shredding and recycling of ELVs. In this paper, in order to comply with related regulations and manage the recovery of ELVs efficiently, we presented a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model for network design including the different actors taking part in ELV recovery system. The proposed framework is justified by a real case performed in Ankara, the capital and second largest city of Turkey. We also presented a modeling approach for the projection of car ownership and number of ELVs and generated scenario analyzes based on the long-term average developments in the number of ELVs. The case study and analyzes provided important insights on how logistics network behave over time. The results demonstrated that the number of facilities to be located and the system cost increase while the number of ELVs are getting higher in the future.}

However, selecting suitable measures in disaster preparedness is a complex task. Some mitigation measures, which include making dams and updating building codes, prove ineffective and can themselves become a source of added vulnerability. Therefore, the importance of preparedness cannot be ignored, and the relief distribution aspect needs to be appraised as a measure of disaster preparedness. This study integrates disaster preparedness and response. Many parameters cannot be known before a disaster, while relief demand is a key parameter in disaster preparedness modelling. A decision maker needs to identify the properties of relief demand. Seven influencing factors of relief demand are identified. Then, a facility location model is proposed, and the model results are analysed. The results show that the hub-and-spoke distribution system brings higher social benefits.}

abstract = {The increase in green cane mechanized harvesting is making available a large volume of additional biomass, sugarcane trash, which can be used in bioenergy and/or as feedstock for production of cellulosic ethanol. Trash requires a supply chain for its collection and industrial processing, and currently two routes are being used: the baling system and the integral harvesting system. The baling system consists of the collection of dry trash (moisture less than 15%) through large square bales with a weight of 500kg and dimension of 1.2×0.9×2.4m, and integral harvesting is the transportation of the trash with the chopped cane during harvesting through the reduction of cleaning efficiency of sugarcane harvesters. The decision of which is the best collection route is very complex, and must consider qualitative and quantitative variables. Six dimensions have been created to aid the decision-making process and the dimensions are: supply guarantee, agricultural operations, industrial processing, biomass quality, storage, and investment.}

The development of an ex post monitoring system is an effective way to identify the most critical steps of food distribution and aid operative decisions to improve the control of food safety and quality along storage and transportation. This chapter introduce an ex post monitoring protocol based on temperature sensors to track the environmental stresses experienced by dairy products during milk-run delivery tours. The collected shipping profiles are illustrated and discussed, and the simulation of the collected thermal stresses in properly designed climate rooms is postponed to further researches.}

Although their planning and construction take a considerable amount of time, they form important fixed links once in operation. The fact that these tunnels are located under the sea generally involves unique challenges including complex issues with construction and operations, which relate to the lack of intermediate access points along the final route of the tunnel. Similar issues are associated with long under-land tunnels, such as those under mountain ranges such as the Alps. This paper identifies the key issues related to the design and construction of such tunnels, and suggests a potential solution using proven technology from another engineering discipline.}

Direct shipment model (DT), lateral transhipment model (LTSP) and maritime lateral transhipment model (MLTSP) are developed and compared between each other by using a real life earthquake scenario prepared for the city of Istanbul by JICA (Japanese International Cooperation Agency). Developed mathematical models decide on the locations and number of disaster relief facilities, quantity of relief items to hold at those facilities, and quantity of lateral transhipment between the facilities. Vulnerability of the roads and heterogeneous capacitated facilities are also considered. It can be concluded that both LTSP and MLTSP models gave better results than DT model and lateral transhipment option helps beneficiaries to obtain relief items faster and with higher service level.}

The location of logistic hubs is a strategic decision made after multicriteria analysis. This requires first the definition of quantitative or qualitative criteria that can be independent or partially conflicting. The decision of location can be made at different geographical levels (countries or regions). In this paper, we suggest a generic structuration of criteria by geographical level and by family for choosing hubs location, taking into account the involved structure of location choice, which is rarely done in the literature: sequential assessment (choice of a country, then of a region of this country) or simultaneous assessment (direct choice of a location among several regions belonging to different countries).}

abstract = {Renal transplant candidates with more than 99% CPRA are at greater disadvantage for a match run. Even with a match-run, some of the allelic DSAs not used for Unacceptable Antigens [UA] entry criteria, could make the decision to import an organ from a distant location difficult without knowing the donor’s allele level typing. We describe the case of a patient where the first potential importable organ had to be rejected and the second one could be accepted leading to a successful transplant based on inferred 2 field HLA typing information of the donor. Case: Patient JG, a 24 year old female with a hx of ESRD secondary to pauci-immune glomerulonephritis with a kidney txp in 2001 that failed in 2012 with >99% CPRA got an import kidney offer in Aug 2017 for a donor with an HLA Genotype of A68/-; B35, 39; C1, 7; and DRB1 *0401/04/02/03 at both HLA-DRB1 Loci. The Recipient had strong antibody to DRB1*04:02 [MFI 7000 consistently]and B39MFI = 3117. Since the donor had a potential DRB1*04:02 on both DR4 loci and a B39, the offer was rejected. HLA-DR4 could not be entered as UA despite a high MFI value since listed patient was DRB1*04:01/*04:07. Another offer came through and the donor had a DRB1*04 but the most possible alleles were depicted as DRB1*04: 03/*04:07 and DRB1*04:02 was not an option. So the only HLA DSA the patient had towards this donor was B39 [MFI = 3117]; Accepted the organ and the real cross match was negative, the transplant was done and the Recipient is doing well as of now. Allele-specific antibodies and their impact on real cross matches have been highlighted by failed NKR Chains not knowing allele specific DSAs. Also, when a patient is listed as DRB1*04, we cannot list any UAs as DR4. And as we propagate our ability to assign antibody specificity based on the single antigen bead based assays, we are still at large with allele-specific antibodies that could be crucial. We have an example of a case where the Recipient had antibodies against B*35:01 and DRB1*14:01/02/54; and had a donor with B*35:12 and DRB1*14:07 -And No beads to assess antibodies against B*35:12 or DRB1*14:07. Conclusion: Virtual crossmatch can be an excellent tool as long as we have reliable data on DSAs in terms of the allele-specific antibodies where applicable, and it is extremely important when one make decision to import an organ based on potential allele-specific DSAs.}

The problem is formulated as a capacitated vehicle routing problem with time windows, where several heuristic procedures have been tested, considering both static and dynamic travel times. With respect to the standard operational costs used typically, a multivariable objective function has been proposed which takes into account also a new risk index. The risk index proposed is function of the population density of the zones covered by each path and of the estimated number of road accidents on each road link. In such a way, we take into account the population’s exposure to the risk associated with an incidental event involving a fuel tank. The obtained output is the set of planned routes with minimum service cost and minimum risk. Results demonstrate how an accurate planning of the service saves up to 3 hours and 30 km on a daily basis compared to a benchmark. Moreover, the distribution company can parameterize the configuration of the service, by varying the weight adopted in order to include the risk index. Including the risk index may bring to a higher safety route planning, with an increase of the operating costs of only 2%.}

The main objective of the paper is to propose a solution and an implementation roadmap for the correlation and harmonization of the currently isolated and partly un-coordinated initiatives related to SW. NSW should build on existing telematic applications and systems like SafeSeaNet, River Information Services or Intelligent Transport Systems for Road Transport.

We explore the impact of multiple factors on these measures as well as the structure of the routes. Our results suggest that companies need rich cost models and routing algorithms with path flexibility to truly minimize total costs.}

abstract = {The accidental and unpredictable nature of disasters such as earthquake brings about some plans to deal with critical problems in order to reduce the dangers at the time of their occurrence. Effective distribution of relief goods and supplies plays an important role in the rescue operation after an earthquake. Therefore, a two-phase, multi-objective mixed integer, multi-period and multi-commodity mathematical modeling in the three-level relief chain was offered, in which, locating of the distribution centers and warehouses with various levels of capacity, related decisions to the stored goods in the warehouses and established distribution centers were considered in the first phase, and considering the limited hard time windows, in the second phase, operational programming was performed for vehicle routing and distribution of goods to the affected areas, so minimizing the total cost and travel time also increased the reliability of the route. In addition to the features considered in this model, in special cases, it is possible that each critical area receives service more than once; to consider split delivery assumption in the problem, a different model will be presented for this purpose. Since some parameters are uncertain during the crisis, in order to let the model approach the reality, using a robust optimization approach, the model was developed in an uncertain condition. Two meta-heuristic algorithms of NSGAII and MOPSO were used to solve the given problem, in which the accuracy of the mathematical model and the proposed algorithms efficiency were assessed through numerical examples. The results of algorithms were presented for 35 various problems.}

abstract = {Hydrogen has been often recognized as the likely energy carrier for the future energy systems because it would represent the universal remedy for the growing concerns in accordance with fossil resource depletion, global warming, and increased air pollution. The benefits are motivated given the great number of primary energy sources used for its production, such as natural gas, coal, biomass, and water, contributing toward greater energy safety and flexibility. Generally, hydrogen is produced, stored, and then transported to the end users; in general, it must be transported from production plants to the storage or demand points. So that, the delivery process of its supply chain brings new hazards exposures. Hence, a safe and sustainable transition to the use of hydrogen requires that the safety issues associated with the hydrogen have to be investigated and fully understood. For planning and installing on a large-scale production and distribution infrastructure in urban areas, good standards and best practices are indispensable. Safe practices in the production, storage, distribution, and use of hydrogen are essential for the widespread acceptance of hydrogen technologies. Public authorities have to find the correct balance between socially important standards in terms of safety and promoting R&D in the hydrogen sector. It may be reasonable not to set standards too strictly during premarket development, in order to maintain enough stimuli for private investment in R&D.}

abstract = {A hypothetical regional biogas power generation system based on multiple biomass feedstocks for the Catania province in Sicily was developed. A three-step approach of data collection, GIS-based analysis, and techno-economic assessment was used to analyze and design the biogas power generation system. Based on the amount of available and useable biomass, the biogas power generation system with a nominal electricity capacity of 3.6 MW-e can convert 211,000 t/year biomass into 15,374,000 m3 biogas, 30,000 metric ton soil amendment, and generate 23.1 GWh-e electricity and 35.5 GWh-e heat per year. The geographic information system (GIS) based analysis determines the size and location of four biogas plants in the system. The techno-economic assessment concludes that the system is able to satisfy 27% of the total agricultural electricity demand in the province and shows excellent economic performance with a discounted payback period of less than 6.5 years for the entire biogas power generation system. The results clearly demonstrate that the regional biogas production system can offer a sustainable solution for renewable electricity generation using agricultural residues and food wastes in Sicily. This study also elucidated that the three-step approach is a suitable method to carry out such analysis and to facilitate establishing biogas plants in different regions.}

abstract = {In recent years the European Commission has increasingly focused its attention on the development of sustainable city logistics by promulgating legislation and formal directives. Despite the efforts made, reducing freight-related congestion and polluting emissions without penalising social and economic activities within cities is still a challenging issue. City logistics measures frequently fail mainly due to a lack of support and commitment from stakeholders. A participatory approach in freight transport planning represents a reasonable and valuable option. This paper describes the innovative governance model developed in the city of Turin in Italy that was based on a proactive and effective stakeholders' cooperation for achieving a resilient urban development. The added value of the paper also relates to the real-life assessment of the impacts the non-mandatory policy-mix implemented, based on a collaborative governance model, have on the environment and service delivery thus providing a realistic measure of the viability and effectiveness of the solution proposed. Its voluntary adoption, in fact, produces an increase in commercial vehicles’ speed and a substantial reduction in CO2 emissions while also allowing logistic service providers to perform more deliveries.}
