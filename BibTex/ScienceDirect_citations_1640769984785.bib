abstract = {Relief distribution and victim evacuation are the crucial emergency relief operations after sudden-onset disasters to alleviate the repercussions of catastrophes in the concerned areas, although aftershocks and unfair distribution of relief items can affect these planning and beget plenty of undesirable reflections. In this paper, a new multi-objective reliable optimization model to organize a humanitarian relief chain is rendered to make a broad range of decisions, including reliable facility location-allocation, fair distribution of relief items, assignment of victims, and routing of trucks. For this purpose, the first objective function is to minimize the total logistics costs, the second one is to minimize the total time of relief operations, and the third one minimizes the variation between upper and lower bounds of transportation cost of distribution centers to regulate the workload of them. What is more, due to the fact that the uncertain essence of catastrophes, such as demand, the capacity of facilities, miscellaneous costs and transportation times, a novel uncertainty approach, including robust optimization and the neutrosophic set, is proposed to surmount these obstacles. Ultimately, a real case study is examined to illustrate the validity of the proposed model and solution method. The obtained results reveal that via increasing the capacity of the emergency centers by 30%, the total cost of the humanitarian relief network is reduced by 18%, and the operating time is reduced by 9%. What is more, if the probability of disruption in one of the distribution centers reaches zero, the logistics costs will be reduced to approximately 20%, and also the distance between the maximum and minimum distance traveled will be reduced by 30%, and the workload between distribution centers will be more balanced.}

abstract = {Liquid bulk cargo (LBC) volume analysis has received considerably great attention recently since LBC is a valuable and high-demand cargo. Thus, it is important to establish an analysis system for LBC volume, as it can help inform strategies for port planning and management. Nevertheless, LBC volume analysis is a challenging task for researchers because trends in LBC volume are highly volatile and non-stationary. In this paper, a new framework for enabling informative LBC volume analysis based on bill of lading (BL) data is proposed, which consists of three parts: item segmentation, exploratory volume analysis, and volume prediction. Firstly, an innovative item segmentation system using item texts of BL data was developed, which can generate subcategory as well as category information of LBC items that existing system cannot provide. Next, exploratory volume analysis was performed to understand the volume characteristics of each categorized and subcategorized item in terms of geography and timeline. Lastly, manifold learning- and deep learning-based time series techniques were proposed to increase LBC volume prediction accuracy compared with existing statistical models. The experimental results for volume prediction show the accuracy increased by 34% and 18% in average at category and subcategory levels over baseline models. It is believed that our proposed method will be helpful for stakeholders in maritime logistics, giving them the insights that they need to make better decisions.}

It is as the emanation of the social and economic priority – the sustainability concept. Based on the relevant literature review, the Authors made an attempt to identify the ecological utility of FQP activities. Further, the paper presents the results of a questionnaire-based research depicting levels of environmental awareness, manifested by various groups of UFT stakeholders in Szczecin. The research has been divided into two parts – the first focuses on internal FQP stakeholders (FQP members), and the second focuses on external FQP stakeholders (various city users and local authorities). The results show in what manner different stakeholders’ groups recognize and assess the FQP activities.}

In the meantime, the issue of Closed-loop Supply Chain (CLSC) has received considerable attention as it ensures many diverse industries toward sustainability. But many industries including agricultural section often fail to address and fulfill these requirements. In this study, a new CLSC network is designed for the walnut industry as a part of agricultural crop by conducting a complete review of the past studies. Therefore, a new Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) for the proposed network is developed minimizing the overall costs of the walnut industry. The designed network considers both forward and reverse flow not only to meet the demands of various markets, but also to prepare the returned products for the second use. In order to solve the proposed model, a set of exact, metaheuristics, and hybrid metaheuristics are employed. Finally, the best solutions are obtained by assessing the finest initial answers using Taguchi method. The results notoriously illustrated the excellent consistency between the proposed network and the employed algorithms along with its applicability and efficiency.}

abstract = {Context
The U.S. food supply system relies heavily on vertically-integrated food supply chains (FSCs), which leverage large-scale production, streamlined operations, and centralized planning and control to provide consumers with a consistent supply of food. However, these FSCs were seriously disrupted upon the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in spring 2020. During the height of the crisis, they were slow to respond to production system failures and sudden and widespread changes in consumer demand. By contrast, many regionalized food supply chains (RFSCs) proved to be adaptive and responsive to changes in demand and delivery requirements, quickly pivoting to distribute products directly to consumers safely.
Objective
The objective of this research is to explore how RFSCs can improve the resilience of the U.S. food supply system in the face of large-scale disruptions like the COVID-19 crisis. In particular, this research seeks to gain a greater understanding of how RFSCs can leverage logistics best practices for efficient and reliable distribution to consumers in normal times and during disasters.
Methods
This study presents seven case studies of RFSCs in Texas and Iowa that adopted logistics best practices to enable them to provide their customers with convenient and safe purchasing mechanisms during the COVID-19 emergency. A description of how the strategies adopted by each participant promote the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development goals is provided.
Results and conclusions
The successes experienced by these farmers and distributors at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic were a consequence of their willingness to adopt new distribution and logistics strategies. Collaboration among RFSC actors was a particularly effective strategy, as well as the adoption of scale-appropriate information and communication technologies, which helped to facilitate collaboration. Further, these case studies demonstrate how improved logistics performance allowed RFSCs to contribute to the health and well-being of their communities in a time of need.
Significance
These case studies demonstrate the potential of RFSCs to support a resilient and socially-sustainable food system that communities can rely on, even in the face of a major disruption like COVID-19. The adoption of logistics best practices helped these RFSCs to develop new organizational strengths that will likely support sustainable development in their communities after the crisis ends.}

MaaS is a user-oriented service concept providing door-to-door mobility solutions for people. It integrates services of multiple providers, enabling searching, booking, and payment through a single digital platform. Although MaaS is often presented as a great opportunity to increase the efficiency of the overall transport system, its application is constrained to passenger transport. The possibility of combining freight and passenger trips in MaaS might contribute to improving capacity utilization in passenger transport and to reducing freight movements in cities. The aim of the paper is to systematically explore the service models through which integration might take place and to qualitatively assess their potential impact. Based on a suitable conceptualization of what we called MaaS4PaF, i.e. MaaS for Passenger and Freight, we identify relevant logistics segments, propose service models and evaluate these from a multi-stakeholder and sustainability perspective. The analysis results in propositions about the fitness between on-demand freight and passenger systems combined in MaaS, as well as a related research agenda to further investigate the potential of this approach for future sustainable mobility.}

abstract = {The cement industry has been under pressure due to the environmental impact of high cement production, which demands a significant amount of energy and results in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In many developed countries, the cement industry has sought to replace conventional fossil fuels with alternatives to minimize GHG emissions; however, Brazil has underexploited this possibility. Considering the potential of refuse-derived fuel (RDF) to reduce the non-recycled waste disposed in landfills, and its suitable performance as an alternative fuel for cleaner cement production, this paper presents a reverse logistics network analysis for RDF production planning with respect to local economic incentives, social euqity and justice, pollution prevention, and global environmental concerns regarding carbon emissions reduction. The reverse logistics network involves important stakeholders related in waste management in Espirito Santo, Brazil, especially harmonizing social sustainability concerns between waste pickers’ cooperatives and waste retailers. By considering the waste generated in 78 municipalities in the Espírito Santo state, the possible levels of fuel replacement in cement industries reflects the economic sustainability of the timeframe of the solid waste management policy implementation. The results showed that the RDF to be produced varies from 42,446.5 tonnes in 2024 with a small fuel replacement by cement industries, to 567,092.1 tonnes in 2040 if all non-recyclable waste available can be used to produce RDF. The avoided annual disposal costs via this network analysis vary from $3,855,412.0 in the initial years to $47,822,876.8 in the year 2040 under optimistic conditions, representing around 25% of the total cost in the network. The cost and GHG emitted reduced significantly in all simulated scenarios; however, the financial incentives are essential for achieving the network social sustainability.}

We found that carcass bruising was a highly prevalent problem (79% of carcasses had bruising) and was especially problematic in journeys lasting longer than 12 h, independently of the animal's country of origin, sex, age, lairage time or vehicle type. Multivariable logistic regression showed that the most severe bruises were not dispersed randomly on the carcass and that their distribution was associated with the presence of medium-sized bruises on the abdominal wall, front and rear limb. Cluster analysis suggested four damage patterns based on bruise location: severe and concentrated bruising, as well as non-severe bruises on the rear limb, thoracic-wall or more dispersed throughout the carcass.}

A successful transition from the current, linear economic model towards a resource-efficient circular economy model requires a shared understanding of the interplay among the building blocks of circular economy and the interaction among various decision factors. This research aims to explore these dynamics using environmental, societal, and economic aspects from a reverse supply chain perspective. This paper presents a model to represent the complex system of reverse logistics to recover post-used products at their end-of-life (EoL) stage. A system dynamics (SD) approach is used to model the dynamics of cost, revenue, and strategic and regulatory decisions. In addition, the interplay among the main pillars of circular economy research is explored through a case study of electric vehicle batteries (EVBs). Moreover, the main enablers and challenges for recovery of end-of-life batteries are presented. The findings show the importance of a shared understanding to achieve a successful transition towards a resource-efficient and circular economy model. Furthermore, reuse strategies such as remanufacturing and repurposing present a huge market potential for the recovery of electric vehicle batteries in the near future.}

The paper describes the features and main risk factors affecting the transport and technological processes of moving essential goods. Currently, active efforts are being taken at the state level to launch projects for the development of the relevant infrastructure in the Arctic to solve problems with transport and logistics support of freight transportation. The climatic factor, which has a significant impact on the operation time of temporary transport routes, is considered the main one. For instance, in the summer, the period of navigation along the northern rivers depends on the climatic conditions. In the course of transport planning for the delivery to the northern territories (Severny Zavoz), the beginning and end of navigation can be predicted, which makes it possible to improve the transportation plans and reduce economic losses from downtime during multimodal transportation.}

In Japan, based on past disasters, three empirical control strategies related to humanitarian logistics have been proposed: two relief transportation strategies, and an information strategy without ICT. This paper reveals the mathematical properties of these empirical strategies using an analytic model with closed-form solution. Our approach is based on the stochastic optimal control theory that has never been applied for analyzing humanitarian logistics. Specifically, we formulate the inventory distribution problem considering demand uncertainty as a stochastic optimal control problem with the objectives of minimizing inventory holding and handling costs. Additionally, we consider information uncertainty after a disaster using the Bayesian updating process. This process, by updating at different intervals among depots, models information asynchrony caused by not using ICT. Finally, we analyze the optimal control strategy to reveal the mathematical properties of three empirical strategies. Our results clarify that the two empirical transportation strategies are effective. However, we suggest that in the empirical information strategy without ICT the information paradox, wherein the system gets worse by using information, may occur.}

One of the most talked-about developments in recent years has been the potential use of unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, for transporting packages, food, medicine, and other goods. Delivery by drones offers new possibilities, but also induces new challenging routing problems. In this paper, we address and extend the so-called Parallel Drone Scheduling Traveling Salesman Problem. Basically, in this problem, deliveries are split between a vehicle and one or several drones. The vehicle performs a classical delivery tour from the depot, while the drones are constrained to perform back and forth trips. The objective is to minimize the completion time. We extend the problem by considering several vehicles. We call it Parallel Drone Scheduling Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem. We propose a hybrid metaheuristic for its solution. The procedure starts by building a giant tour visiting all customers. Then, the giant tour is split in order to determine a set of vehicles tours (each vehicle tour following the order defined by the giant tour) and a set of customers assigned to drones. Thirdly, an improvement step move customers between vehicles or between vehicles and drones. We also propose a Mixed Integer Linear Programming formulation and a simple branch-and-cut approach. The proposed approach is validated via an experimental campaign on instances taken from the CVRPLIB11Capacited Vehicle Routing Problem LIBrary library. Computational experiments comparing several variants of the hybrid metaheuristic give some insights on this drone delivery system.}

Procurement is usually not linked to transport and data from procured goods and services do not provide sufficient insights to estimates the impacts of deliveries and trips related to the procured goods and services. This contribution discusses two cases in which (local) authorities try to make the urban freight transport that results from their procurement activities visible, via different methods, such as delivery service plans, and spend analyses. The cases of Rotterdam (in the project BuyZET) and for the logistics hub in The Hague show the first results of how (local) authorities can act to improve urban freight transport once the trips caused by procured goods and services are clearly mapped.}

However, the first mile handled by individual companies is beset by high empty haul rates and low efficiency. This paper takes the lead in exploring a new business model and possibilities of establishing a common service platform for the first mile. We investigate strategic decisions of two courier logistics companies competing with partially substitutable collection service. They can choose to cooperate with the cost-efficient platform to enjoy a saving, while the market share of their original channel has to be eroded by the outsourcing channel. We propose three scenarios: (i) Both companies have only one direct channel. (ii) Only one company has two channels. (iii) Both companies have two. This paper comprehensively presents the joint effect of internal competition and the cost saving on companies’ welfare and customers’ consuming experience. The findings show that in most cases, cooperating with the platform will help the companies gain a profit increment and customers will benefit from a price decrease compared to the current practice. However, when customers loyalty to the direct channel is moderate, they will suffer a price increase, though companies are better off. Additionally, given the cost advantage of outsourcing is slighter, and customers show less difference to two channels, the internal competition will be the most intensified and overtake the effect of cost sparing. The company running two channels will suffer a profit loss.}

abstract = {We address the problem of dispatching and pro-actively repositioning service resources in service networks such that fast responses to service requests are realized in a cost-efficient way. By formulating this problem as a Markov decision process, we are able to investigate the structure of the optimal policy in the application domain of service logistics. Using these insights, we then propose scalable dynamic heuristics for both the dispatching and repositioning sub-problem, based on the minimum weighted bipartite matching problem and the maximum expected covering location problem, respectively. The dynamic dispatching heuristic takes into account real-time information about both the state of equipment and the fleet of service engineers, while the dynamic repositioning heuristic maximizes the expected weighted coverage of future service requests. In a test bed with a small network, we show that our most advanced heuristic performs well with an average optimality gap of 4.3% for symmetric instances and 5.8% for asymmetric instances. To show the practical value of our proposed heuristics, extensive numerical experiments are conducted on a large test bed with service logistics networks of real-life size where significant savings of up to 56% compared to a state-of-the-art benchmark policy are attained.}

Freight transportation represents a lifeline for urban retail and industry, but causes significant negative impacts on the quality of living in urban areas in terms of congestion, emissions and space consumption. City logistics initiatives have long suggested the need for collaborative and environmentally friendly urban transportation that could alleviate the negative impacts of urban transportation, but these face organizational and technological challenges of collaboration. Given technological advancements and innovative business models, concepts of collaborative urban transportation could contribute to a future paradigm of more sustainable and customer-friendly urban transportation. In this work, we collect and discuss contributions to collaborative freight transportation in urban areas with focus on recent publications (i.e. those published over the past ten years). We particularly analyze vertical and horizontal approaches of collaboration from an operations research perspective and point out strategic, tactical, and operational planning problems and solution approaches. To highlight research gaps and future research opportunities, we present innovative examples of collaborative urban transportation and analyze factors of failure and success. Collecting recent advances in theory and practice of collaborative urban transportation allows us to distill alternative visions of future collaborative freight transportation in urban areas.}

abstract = {This article proposes an activity-based costing decision model that considers the life cycle of physical assets particularly, the logistics costs of non-repairable spare parts. The Weibull based failure rate behavior along the life cycle is considered to have a more realistic representation of the demand and a more accurate computation of the logistics costs associated with the different types of spare parts. Thus, through the use of this model it is possible to evaluate different inventory policies and their respective parameters in order to define efficient long-term inventory policies. Also, it represents a decision-making tool for assessing the effects of the different failure rates of each critical spare part. Finally, it can be used as an optimization tool for supporting the design of logistics policies namely, in terms of stock and service levels, and costs. The activity-based life-cycle costing (AB-LCC) model proposed here mitigates limitations of both activity-based costing (ABC) and life-cycle costing (LCC) approaches through a novel combination of these concepts. Theoretical and managerial contributions and several applications and extensions of the AB-LCC model are expected as it is discussed at the end of the article. Specifically, the model presented here is a valuable tool for maintainers to manage critical non-repairable spare parts inventories.}

abstract = {Cargo-bicycles are a promising alternative to conventional vans in city logistics in response to increasing urbanisation and environmental damage caused by city traffic. The delivery structure is modelled with the well studied Two-Echelon Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (2E-CVRP), which uses cross-docking from vans to cargo-bicycles at so-called satellites. To reduce the extra handling effort compared to single-tier systems, swap containers are used. Furthermore, for cargo-bicycles the consideration of asymmetric distance matrices is important. Therefore, we present the Asymmetric 2E-CVRP with Swap Containers and develop an efficient Parallelised Large Neighbourhood Search heuristic, that is further improved using a first-level heuristic. The heuristic is tested using the symmetric 2E-CVRP benchmark instances from the literature, outperforms previous heuristics for large instances and finds new best-known solutions. Subsequently, the heuristic is applied to a case study in Munich with 22 newly generated instances, each containing 200 customers and asymmetric distances. The results allow quantitative insights into the cost and CO2e emissions savings of the investigated cargo-bicycle set-up compared to conventional van delivery.}

Unpredictability of demand, narrow lead times, highly chaotic and rapidly changing circumstances demand for a different approach to disaster management. The traditional event-based approach to manage natural hazards is, in fact, no longer economically viable, and it should be transformed into a risk-based management slant with a strong emphasis on planning, in preparedness. This paper is an attempt in that direction and proposes an integration of multi-criteria decision-making, network optimization, and discrete event simulation, to address inventory prepositioning for improving efficiency, effectiveness, and agility of relief chains. While humanitarian logistics has been traditionally relying on the sole practical experience of practitioners, this paper makes a case for a paradigm shift as it proposed an interdisciplinary approach integrating that practical experience with analytical and dynamic simulation methods that have been widely applied in the commercial supply chain arena. A real-life case study about Indonesia, one of the countries with the highest disaster risk exposure on a global scale, has been investigated with the use of anyLogistix software. The findings of this work depict the ideal network configuration along with transportation and inventory policies for the case at hand.}

One key element of this transformation is the acceleration of physical and information flows in order to reduce the lead time. At this stage, scientists and practitioners know little about how accelerated processes impact order pickers’ perception of their work autonomy. Therefore, this paper aims to address this research gap. Additionally, we investigate the literature on autonomy to gain an understanding of this important concept. The research project involved a questionnaire completed by order pickers. The test persons were selected from a German food retailing company and have been working with either a pick-by-terminal (n=10) or a pick-by-voice system (n=10). The findings indicate that pickers using pick-by-terminal technology experience higher work autonomy than the ones using pick-by-voice. A further correlation analysis proves that the average performance is crucial for the perceived work autonomy and that work error autonomy is reduced the longer the pickers are employed. Based on these results, logistics management has to find ways to increase work autonomy for highly efficient pickers in both picking systems and lower the experience of isolation for voice based order picking.}

Nevertheless, the weekly schedule of movements used to transport packages through the network leads to changes in equipment inventory at the facility level, which will hinder their normal operations if it is not carefully taken care of. Traditional rebalancing seeks to move the equipment empty in the most cost efficient way. In contrast, we investigate a substitution-based equipment balancing which has been rarely considered. More specifically, we try to reduce this change, i.e., the equipment imbalance associated with the schedule of movements, by substituting the equipment types initially assigned to movements. Consequently, substantial unnecessary empty repositioning needed to restore balance can be avoided at the end. We conduct complexity analysis of the underlying optimization problems, i.e., finding the minimum imbalance of the network and minimizing the number of substitutions required to achieve the minimum network imbalance. In addition, we develop integer programming (IP) models and propose an efficient two-phase decomposition heuristic for solution. Furthermore, we perform a computational study using real-world instances to analyze the performance of the IP solution approach and assess the benefits of substitution-based equipment balancing.}

A Reverse Logistics (RL) network is then proposed to regulate the end-of-life disposal of CDW, after which mathematical formulas are introduced to calculate the disposal costs and carbon emissions, to achieve environmental and economic balance. The results showed that the methodology was successfully applied, with precise CDW information obtained for the disposal cost and emission estimations, and high recovery of CDW was guaranteed to achieve sustainable waste development. Efforts can be made on CDW 3D visualization interfaces and the social benefits consideration in future research.}

abstract = {The negative impacts of urban logistics have fostered the search for new distribution systems in inner city deliveries. In this context, interesting solutions can be developed around two-echelon distribution systems based on mobile depots (2E-MD), where loads arriving from the periphery of the city are directly transferred, at intermediate locations, from larger to smaller vehicles more suited to operate in the city centre. Four types of 2E-MD can be identified, according to the degree of mobility of larger vehicles and their accessibility to customers. In this paper, we propose a generic three-index arc-based mixed integer programming model, for a two-echelon vehicle routing problem, with synchronisation at the satellites and multi-trips at the second echelon. This generic base model is formulated for the most restrictive type of problems, where larger vehicles visit a a single transfer location and do not perform direct deliveries to customers, but it can be easily extended to address the other types of 2E-MD. The paper presents how these extensions account for the characteristics of the different types of 2E-MD. The generic model, its extensions and the impact of a set of valid inequalities are tested using problem instances adapted from the VRP literature. Results show that the proposed extensions do adequately address the specific features of the different types of 2E-MD, including multiple visits to satellites, and direct deliveries to customers. Nevertheless, the resulting models can only tackle rather small instances, even if the formulations can be strengthened by adding the valid inequalities proposed in the paper.}

In contrast, the complexity of the overall system, characterized by multiple actors with conflicting goals, requires a strategy that harmonizes these actors’ business and operational models. This study contributes in this direction along three axes. First, it defines the main actors involved in urban parcel delivery, and then analyzes their business models and the interactions between them. Second, it investigates the integration of traditional and green logistics (mainly cycle-logistics), from both business and operational perspectives, in order to identify synergies, conflicts, and the operational and economic consequences of adopting green vehicles. Third, it introduces a simulation-optimization decision support system tool capable of assessing mixed-fleet policies for the management of parcel delivery in urban areas.

This paper examines the role of environmental supplier development programs led by the buying organization on supplier environmental practices, while testing the mediating effects of the supplier in the forms of resource allocation and collaboration with the buyer. The relationships are tested based on survey data from 267 supplier organizations in the UK using Partial Least Squares (PLS). The results indicate that supplier development in the form of setting requirements and audits has a wide, positive impact on all supplier environmental activities, while environmental supplier development in the form of direct projects only affects supplier environmental activities in logistics and transport. The results for the mediation effects tested are varied: while supplier collaboration is important to enhance the supplier logistics and transport activities, supplier resource allocation proves to be mediating the impact of environmental supplier development on the supplier energy efficiency and logistics and transport activities. The research sheds new light on the effectiveness of supplier development and environmental programs. The findings indicate that buying organizations should make explicit reference to the way they define supplier collaboration and resource allocation for their environmental plans and environmental supplier development programs to be effective.}

Brazil is the second major e-waste producer in Americas, after USA, with 1.5 million tones generated annually. However, the absence of adequate system for e-waste reverse logistics are a reality in most of the Brazilian cities. Concerning this hypothesis, we proposed a scenario analysis to support decision-making in e-waste management. This study analyzed the e-waste amount generation, the location of the recycling companies of this segment and the collection routes in the metropolitan region of Rio de Janeiro (MRRJ). Besides, we proposed a set of criteria and indicators to identify the best option for e-waste management. The analysis indicates that Rio de Janeiro is the biggest e-waste producer of the MRRJ, with an amount of approximately 127 ton/day, corresponding to 251 collection points, which represents a high discrepancy in relation to the other municipalities of MRRJ. The findings point out that indicators, such as the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Municipal Human Development Index (MHDI), could be used as an alternative for a more accurate analysis for a sustainable urban grid design. This study identified 24 e-waste recycling industries that services the current demand of the MRRJ, most of them concentrated in the central and south portions of the MRRJ, which coincide with the municipalities with the biggest e-waste generation rates. Some hotspots, however, are isolated from the recycling industries, as observed at the MRRJ extremes. In order to provide a better choice for e-waste reverse logistics routes, we proposed 12 indicators, in environmental, economic and social dimensions. Thirty-five hotspots were identified and divided in five main routes according to the recycling industries nearby and the local roads. Urban mining of e-waste seems to be an interesting alternative for secondary raw material recovery, especially in an emerging economy country like Brazil, that consumes huge amounts of electronic devices and demands solutions compatible with environmental law requirements. Hence, this study contributes for a more sustainable development pattern regarding e-waste management in the country, since it reinforces the importance of circularity.}

The model considers the manufacturing, storage, and assembly stages, along with the selection of optimal warehouse locations. Using robust optimisation, the model accounts for common causes of schedule deviations in construction sites, including inclement weather, late deliveries, labour productivity fluctuations and crane malfunctions. A school dormitory construction project is used as a case study, demonstrating that the proposed model outperforms existing techniques in settings with multiple sources of uncertainty.}

Using this simulation model, a second model based on multiple linear regression is built to investigate the relationship between ‘the minimum number of orders required to reach profitability’ and several independent variables, such as the share of the total purchase order or the delivery time-distance.

abstract = {This study deals with downstream logistics of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) by tank trucks both at regional and urban level. The distribution problem is formulated as a capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) with time windows. Its solution is based on a two steps procedure with the aim of maximizing the revenue of the logistic operator: 1) in the first step, the problem is solved at suburban level, where each delivery point represents a municipality in the study area. The employed objective function of the VRP has been conceived as to integrate the usual operating costs with aspects related to infrastructure characteristics of the used paths; 2) in the second step, door to door deliveries at urban level are attempted, taking into account the operating costs and the last delivery time for each potential client. The method has been applied in a real case study based in the city of Perugia, Italy. Sensitivity analysis considering different values for the parameters regulating the relative weights of the objective function components has been performed. Results show that the potential revenues for the operator can be doubled through the proposed optimization procedure. Moreover, explicitly taking into account that not all roads are suitable for vehicles transporting hazardous materials can increase the security of the distribution process, resulting in a service cost increase of just +1.4% with respect to extant conditions.}

This paper reviews the literature for modeling and optimization studies of lignocellulosic biomass supply chains with densification processes. Research studies in academic journals, books, and trade publications are classified based on four criteria: biomass type, densification form, analytical methodology, and densification machines’ mobility. We find that baling is the most-studied densification technique, while optimization modeling is the most common analysis method. Although pelleting and pyrolysis achieve a higher density than baling, comparatively few studies have examined their role in the overall supply chain. We identify future research opportunities, the most significant of which are integrating mobile densification and introducing comprehensive biomass-to-biofuel supply chain optimization models.}

abstract = {Ever-growing urban areas and global population movement towards urbanization lead to major concerns regarding urban logistics and last mile operations. In Latin America, the problem becomes critical since volatile emerging economies and unstable political situations, which are common in the region, introduce additional limitations for strong logistics solutions. In the city of Quito (Ecuador), traffic regulations only consider time-schedule restrictions for vehicle mobility without any other policies that benefit urban goods movement. This is in part because there is a lack of knowledge on freight flows, mainly related to the difficulties to retrieve data to that purpose. This paper proposes a freight trip generation analysis in Quito, based on a methodology included in “MIT’s Better Cities for Logistics Toolkit”, which defines specific zones observation and data collection campaigns. More precisely, a procedure combining observation-based and declarative data collection processes is proposed. First, the opportunities of combining both observed and declared data to characterize freight trip generation are addressed on the basis of a literature review. Main issues of combining establishment based surveys and observations are addressed to generalize the proposed framework. Finally, application implications in a transferability perspective to other Latin American countries are addressed.}

abstract = {In the actual era of the international trade, global warming and depletion of Earth’s natural resources, the willingness to generate sustainable and competitive benefits determines us to stop thinking linearly (produce, consume and dispose) and to shift towards a circular approach by closing material loops. The latter falls within the concept of circular economy that, in turn, derives from reverse logistics. This paper proposes a comprehensive state-of-the-art review around the topic of circular economy and reverse logistics with a particular emphasis on mid-term production planning under discrete time settings. The broad spectrum of reviewed publications is categorized and discussed with respect to the main recovery operations, namely: (i) disassembly for recycling, (ii) from product to raw material recycling, and (iii) by-products and co-production. For each of the aforementioned recovery options, this paper elucidates the related definitions, reviews the mathematical formulations jointly with a structured overview of the solution methods, and discusses their industrial implications. Given the legislative pressure to mitigate environmental impacts caused by production processes, a special attention is paid to the greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption. A cross-cutting analysis of the reviewed literature brought forward a number of research gaps and revealed multiple research opportunities to support the development of the circular economy. The key findings show an ever-growing interest in making sustainable the traditional linear industrial processes within a circular economy context.}

abstract = {In this paper, we focus on a problem that requires the location of recharging stations and the routing of electric vehicles in a goods distribution system. The goods are disseminated from a depot and distributed to the customers via a heterogeneous fleet of electric vehicles with limited capacity. Differently from the classical vehicle routing problem, the vehicles have battery restrictions that need to be recharged at some stations if a trip is longer than their range. The problem reduces to finding the optimal locations of the recharging stations and their number to minimize the total cost, which includes the routing cost, the recharging cost, and the fixed costs of opening stations and operating vehicles. We propose a novel mathematical formulation and an efficient Benders decomposition algorithm embedded into a two-phase general framework to solve this environmental logistics problem. Phase I solves a restricted problem to provide an upper bound for the original problem which is later solved in Phase II. Between the two phases, an intermediate processing procedure is introduced to reduce the computations of the Phase II problem. This is achieved by a combination of the Phase I upper bound and several lower bounds obtained via exploiting the underlying network structure. Our approach solves the problem in a general setting with non-identical stations and vehicles by allowing multiple visits to the stations and partial recharging. The computational study provides both managerial and methodological insights.}

A significant contribution to these relevant economic values is given by not optimized supply chain structures. Therefore, car manufacturers approaching electrification are considering different strategies to either purchase complete LIBs or producing them in-house. However, literature lacks quantitative studies assessing the logistics implications of LIB procurement policies in the automotive sector. The present work proposes a decisionmaking approach leveraging the main logistics and environmental issues involved in both internally producing and buying complete LIB packs. Such a framework is intended to increase the awareness about the complexity of the supply chain of batteries for electric and hybrid vehicles in order to further stimulate its investigation. Future research will extend the approach to include additional aspects as well as procurement configurations.}

As research on the PI concept is still young, the functioning of maritime ports in the context of the PI is still underexplored. Our aim is to contribute to the scientific debate about radically different futures for maritime ports around the world, by identifying their possible future development paths towards the PI. We construct an evolutionary port development framework that identifies the main dimensions of the PI in relation to ports, including governance, operational, and digital aspects. To design the future development paths towards the PI, we conducted a scenario analysis and used a Delphi survey amongst port development and PI experts. The resulting expectation is that a fully globally functioning of the PI may not be reached by 2040. Also, our analysis shows that global governance of FTL systems is critical for the pace of development and adoption. Building on the identified potential future development paths, we provide a discussion, relevant for port authorities and other stakeholders, as well as avenues for future research.}

To improve environmental sustainability, biomass has been used as an alternative to fossil fuels. There is a comprehensive literature on biomass production and conversion, but little attention has been paid to biomass logistics in the cement industry. We propose the use of cement distribution trucks to collect biomass on their return journeys. Compared with the use of specialist biomass suppliers, the collection of biomass via cement distribution networks has greater uncertainties in delivery times, volume and quality. This is because biomass collection is a secondary activity and is subject to cement order quantities and the random geographical locations of cement customers. To cope with these uncertainties, additional on-site storage and handling equipment is required. This paper proposes a stochastic programming model to measure the cost-effectiveness of collecting biomass using returning cement distribution trucks in comparison with purchasing biomass from specialised biomass suppliers. A numerical experiment based on a real-word dataset was conducted to verify the effectiveness of the developed model.}

These areas of high population density generate an increase in commercial activity, being urban freight transport a key factor, in account of providing the goods commercialized in its stores. Urban logistics presents a series of hard-to-solve issues, and the models which seek to align the interests of the various stakeholders in the search for solutions are scarce. The aim of this article is to present a framework to understand the needs of the different stakeholders, and, in this way, to facilitate joint working with the goal of finding solutions for a better management of urban freight transport. It was found that there are many different regions that coexist within the same city, which makes evident that not all solutions are applicable to all of them. By studding deeply one of these regions, it can be inferred that not all cities are prepared for the current challenge that urban freight transport encompasses. The choice of a multi-perspective study appeared to be convenient to address the complexity these process, allowing the researcher team to gather a comprehensive view of this reality. These various aspects were shown in a workshop that included representatives of each of the stakeholders’ groups. In this workshop, the different distribution strategies and regulations that could be implemented in the short and medium term were deeply discussed.}

The approach elaborated is hybrid (combination of experimentation for acquiring real data and design for elaborating concepts and methods required for developing an adapted problem-solving tool). The decision aided tool is elaborated by using formalisms of artificial intelligence (such as expert systems, machine learning, multi-agent systems) in order to optimize medicine dispatching flows in a hospital.

In a bid to explore the application of blockchain technology in HOM, we systematically review the current literature and deployed practices. Our review covers 64 articles that provide contributions which we categorize into four focus areas: (i) overview of blockchain in HOM, (ii) identity and personal data management, (iii) humanitarian logistics, and (iv) humanitarian communications. The majority of the articles that we surveyed focus on the potential benefits of blockchain in HOM, and the enablers and barriers to its adoption. A limited number of theoretical frameworks provide insights into how blockchain can be utilized in HOM to improve operational efficiency, promote trust, and foster collaborations among relief agencies. With the exception of a few pilot programs that have been deployed in the humanitarian setting, we find that the majority of the work addressing the use of blockchain in HOM has not yet been tested in the field, and therefore, little empirical evidence exists to prove blockchain's capabilities in HOM. This paper reports on the major scientific advancements and practical applications for blockchain technology in HOM, as well as promising future research directions on the use of blockchain technology for HOM practitioners and researchers.}

This situation becomes critical due to strong illegal occupation and deterioration of public space, overcrowding by vulnerable populations, informal commerce and common delinquency. This research paper aims to present a diagnosis of loading and unloading operations in Cali’s city-center and, subsequently, to study some improvement strategies considering stakeholders’ opinion. A combination of methodologies permitted obtaining relevant results that shed light on possible innovative actions to reduce land use conflict in city centers of medium sized cities in emerging countries. The results revealed that the freight parking offer was very scarce and concentrated on bay infrastructure and on-street parking, increasing waiting times and congestion. Parking was not controlled, and illegal practices were present throughout the day, including pedestrian path occupation. A combined set of strategies, such as cargo cycle operation and mini-hubs, could raise the parking offer and adapt to different demand conditions in terms of schedules and vehicles sizes. Cooperation between private stakeholders and the strength of institutional structure is essential to harmonize urban freight evaluations and operations with sustainable mobility policies in city centers. Some strategies require a strong set of public incentives, including tax benefits and logistic land use implementation with price controls. City Centers requires loading and unloading zones and logistic land, besides traffic management policies. Logistic land use is disappearing in central urban zones, which is contradictory and is producing a perverse effect. This is an analysis that reveals the importance of planning mixed land uses that include logistics and different vocations of public space.}

We assume that each order’s release date is known at the time of delivery planning. This context is common for many applications, notably last-mile logistics. We develop a Mixed-Integer Linear Program and a solution approach for larger instances based on decomposing the problem into the truck-routing and the drone-resupply decisions. Numerical experiments show that using drones for resupply can reduce the total delivery time by up to 20%. Additionally, experiments show that the decomposition can rapidly obtain high-quality solutions. For instances of 10 and 15 customers, the decomposition solved the majority to optimality, with a trivial gap. For larger instances, this approach provided lower delivery times than a traditional parcel delivery system using a truck only. Investigations on the effects of drone speed, drone capacity, depot location, constraint addition, and allowing the truck to return to the depot are studied. We consider instances up to 50 customers.}

The objective is to unload the cargo from inbound trucks and directly load it into outbound trucks, with little or no storage. The success of the strategy depends on an efficient transshipment operation. This work undertakes a study of truck scheduling in a parallel dock cross-docking center. The problem is first modeled as a two-machine flow shop scheduling problem with precedence constraints, with the objective of minimizing the makespan, and later we generalize it to the parallel-dock case. We propose a hybrid method based on a Lagrangian relaxation technique through the volume algorithm. Using information from the Lagrangian multipliers, constructive heuristics with local search procedures generates good feasible solutions.

At end-of-life (EoL), these batteries must be managed properly to maximize reuse and recycling, which requires an efficient and safe collection and transportation system; however, the logistics of transporting EoL batteries are rarely examined in depth in scholarly research. In this paper, we conduct a critical review of the peer-reviewed literature on EV traction battery reuse and recycling to assess how transportation is represented. We find that among 60 studies identified, 70% mentioned collection and transportation as a challenge to battery reuse or recycling, and 63% identified a need for policy or further research related to collection and transportation. Among 17 papers that focus on cost, estimates for transportation costs vary widely among studies, from more than five dollars per kg to less than 30 cents, representing, on average, 41% of the total cost of recycling. Studies that examined the environmental impact of EoL transportation suggest it contributes 1–3.5% of life cycle GHG emissions for a recycled battery. In response to the limited and highly variable treatment of battery EoL transportation, the literature review is followed by contextual information about the United States, including the regulatory framework and existing network for EoL batteries. Recommendations for future study include place-specific research on optimal facility siting that considers both existing and projected infrastructure, and which reflects costs and environmental and social impacts at local scales.}

abstract = {Most allocation problems on markets are computationally hard. Approximation mechanisms aim for truthfulness and polynomial runtime with provable solution quality. In a seminal contribution, Lavi and Swamy (2011) provide a black-box reduction from approximation algorithms to approximation mechanisms that are truthful-in-expectation without degrading the approximation ratio. This yields a very general approach to designing approximation mechanisms for many market design problems. However, the framework requires a convex decomposition of fractional linear programming solutions. Until recently, the only known polynomial-time decomposition technique relied fundamentally on the notoriously inefficient ellipsoid method. To address this issue, we present a simple and much faster decomposition technique based on an effective geometric algorithm. After a formal comparison of the worst-case performance with a recently published alternative decomposition technique, we conduct an extensive experimental evaluation based on a coordination problem in logistics to show the advantages of the geometric algorithm. The evaluation illustrates runtimes one can expect in a realistic environment and simplifies the application of relax-and-round mechanisms in practice.}

abstract = {Manufacturers’ operation strategies become considerably complicated due to more frequent product updating in the Internet economics. This paper deals with the multi-stage problem of pricing and time-to-market for multi-generation products sold through an online direct channel in a service supply chain with a manufacturer and a logistics service provider. The manufacturer introduces a new generation of products before the present one exits market. The old generation of product may or may not exit the market before the end of the sales period. The service provider is in charge of the logistics service from the manufacturer to the consumers. The manufacturer’s optimal pricing and introduction time strategies and the logistics service provider’s optimal service pricing strategy can be derived. When the substitution rate of a new product to an old one is closer to a threshold, the greater the competition between them, and therefore the lower their optimal prices and the sooner the old product exits market. Moreover, the optimal time-to-market for the new product is decreasing with the potential market share of two generations of products in the second stage. In addition, higher quality which leads to higher costs makes the product enter the market later. Finally, we use numerical examples to illustrate the strategies.}

Last mile deliveries cause costs and emissions especially in urban areas with a high density of e-customers. Therefore, stakeholders in the context of last mile parcel deliveries are interested in implementing efficient, innovative and ecological last mile concepts. Additionally, such concepts must fulfill the requirements and expectations of online customers as parcel recipients because last mile delivery is the critical link between an online purchase and the delivery to the address stated by the customer. In our customer-driven central last mile micro depot (CMD) project a potential analysis was carried out for the implementation of a CMD with the aim of environmentally-friendly and bundled last mile delivery. Our paper tries to close a research gap by examining acceptance and willingness-to-pay for an alternative last mile delivery concept from the perspective of the customer. Our empirical results based on a survey among German major city residents indicate that city residential areas are potentially more suitable for the realization of a CMD-project than other areas. Furthermore, younger and employed inhabitants are most willing to use the CMD. Based on our statistical model we are able to predict values for the willingness to pay per parcel for a specific population of urban inhabitants. A high proportion of the population in cities (60%) would be interested in participating. However, only 36% are willing to pay in addition to the usual parcel delivery charges. 26% are willing to pay €1.00 or more.}

We propose a new way of aggregated urban freight flows modelling, whereby the O-D matrices are transformed depending on the number, location and the share of freight flows attracted by the introduced UCCs. To exemplify the idea, the model is applied in the case of Novi Sad, whereby three different UCC locations and seven distribution patterns were compared. The results might be of interest for the researchers interested in the CL initiatives impact assessment and practitioners involved in the UFT decision-making process.}

Weather and road conditions are still challenging for sensors and actuators. Furthermore, requirements regarding the system, which must be known and met beforehand to guarantee industrial applicability, are yet to be sufficiently determined. This paper aims to close this gap and identify functional requirements through Axiomatic Design, which is used to develop design guidelines for practitioners. Starting with a systematic literature review and semi-structured interviews, the authors gather basic customer requirements. These customer requirements will then be analyzed to define functional requirements. Through a mapping and top-down decomposition process, the research team deduces design solutions for using outdoor AMRs. These requirements and solutions will be transformed into guidelines, which help system designers to improve the implementation of AMRs on the factory premises.}

However, of the extant warehouse research, attention has largely been placed on warehouse design, performance and technology use, yet overlooking the determinants of Artificial Intelligence (AI) adoption within warehouses. Accordingly, through proposing an extension of the Technology–Organisation–Environment (TOE) framework, this research explores the barriers and opportunities of AI within the warehouse of a major retailer. The findings for this qualitative study reveal AI challenges resulting from a shortage of both skill and mind-set of operational management, while also uncovering the opportunities presented through existing IT infrastructure and pre-existing AI exposure of management.}

The supplier offers credit sales to promote express retail ordering, but this inevitably induces credit default risk, especially given an LSP with private credit information and stochastic market demand. To solve this problem, we model a supply chain with an LSP that has either a high or low credit status, which is its private information. In the presence of both stochastic market demand and asymmetric credit information, we propose three credit sales strategies: screening, censoring and factoring. The results indicate that the high-credit status LSP is offered shorter credit periods under all three strategies, while that of the low-credit LSP is unchanged in the screening strategy but lengthened under the censoring and factoring strategies. Moreover, we find that it is more beneficial for the supplier to choose the screening strategy when credit conditions in the market are not particularly good or when the sales incentive effect is relatively small. Otherwise, the supplier has more latitude to exploit all three strategies based on the asymmetric default risk effect. Finally, we show that although a lower expectation or a smaller fluctuation in market demand will induce the supplier to adopt the screening strategy, the growing asymmetric default risk effect becomes crucial in shifting the supplier’s tactic preference regarding credit sales to the other two strategies when either two market factors increase.}

These terminals will allow efficient running of multi-point trains and facilitate train-to-train transfers. At commercially viable places facilities for handling other traffic like containers, perishable products, and automobiles can be integrated. Common facilities will help to decrease the unit costs for the customers and increase the revenue earning potential for the transporter and terminal operator. Value added services like consolidation and breaking up of cargo, packaging, labelling, bar coding, reverse logistics, customs processing etc.; it will enable many customers to dispense with their own supply and forwarding warehouses. Such terminals at Dedicated Freight Corridors in India can capture the emerging fast moving consumer goods and e-commerce traffic. This will simplify supply chains and aid in the reduction of the prices of goods. This is particularly important for India where logistics occupies 13% to 15% of the GDP. Railways having a greater freight market share mean significant environmental benefits. Also the proposed concept will reduce the fleet of trucks and highway congestion. Integrated Freight Terminals (IFT) aided by Automated Freight Management System (AFMS) with automated loading/unloading systems, on-site sorting, storage and transshipment facilities will transform the way commodities are transported by railways. Moreover, faster freight service means faster turnover and return on investment.}

abstract = {Context
China's livestock and poultry industries have been experiencing a transformation over recent decades, transitioning from family-size farms to larger, confined animal feeding operations. This development has significantly improved animal production capacity and reduced costs but has also created new challenges to manure management. One important concern is the conflicting interests of environmental protection and economic welfare between policymakers and manure utilization practitioners.
Objective
In this study, a regional manure utilization chain (RMUC) model was developed by recognizing optimal logistic configurations for manure and manure-based products between animal feeding operations, centralized processing facilities, and crop farms. We then use RMUC model to quantify the impact of management practices to the animal manure utilization chain of Hangzhou, China in the context of sustainable development.
Method
The RMUC model implemented an analytical target cascading structure with a multi-objective optimization algorithm to generate a set of Pareto-optimal configurations for discussing the regional economic costs and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission considering the practitioners' operational decisions to the designated manure management practices.
Results and conclusion
A comparative analysis quantified and prioritized the manure management practices (solid/liquid separation, manure reduction strategies); estimated economic and GHG emission credits of manure composition measurements; and indicated economic and GHG emission benefits of electric vehicles and the secondary infrastructures on manure distribution. The results showed sustainable metrics of the manure utilization improvement, including private costs, regional benefits, and the global impact of GHG emissions.
Significance
The RMUC model demonstrated the compromise between practitioners' interests and public sustainability benefits given a certain level of constraints in decision process. Our analysis is an example of implementing computational models to deal with agricultural systematic problems with social, environmental, and economic concerns.}

Each transporter specifies its vehicle capacity, available time periods, and a cost structure. We formulate the mathematical model and provide a Branch-and-Cut approach to solve small-scale problem instances exactly and larger scale instances heuristically using an Adaptive Large Neighbourhood Search approach. To increase the win percentage of both shippers and transporters, we propose an extension of the single round auction to a second-round for failed bids. Using our models and the results obtained, we present interesting managerial insights that are helpful to platform participants. For example, due to the cost structure, there is little impact on profitability with time varying speeds, but time windows play a significant role in the profitability of the system. And there are tangible benefits that all platform participants (shippers, transporters and operator) can gain by extending single-round auction to two rounds.}

Residual biomass feedstocks considered are woodchips from primary forestry residues, grape pomace, and exhausted olive pomace. The calculated cost of methanol is equal to 418.7 €/t with conversion facility cost accounting for 50% of the fuel cost share while transportation and storage costs for around 15%. When considering only woodchips the price of methanol increases to 433.4 €/t outlining the advantages of multi-feedstock approach.}

abstract = {Public evacuation preparation exerts an important impact on overall evacuation efficiency during regional evacuations. Early warnings often delay the occurrence of chemical accidents. Studying the characteristics of public evacuation preparation in such accidents will help develop better evacuation strategies considering the actual public response. In this work, the characteristics and factors influencing public evacuation preparation behaviors were analyzed by examining an evacuation case in China. The results indicated that the probability distribution of public's evacuation preparation time during a regional evacuation conforms to a Weibull distribution regardless of whether or not evacuation warnings were received. An estimation model of the traffic flow loading rate in a regional evacuation was then proposed on the basis of this finding. The results of this research can provide a reliable reference for evacuation modeling or logistics optimization for future incidents.}

abstract = {The paper extends two alternative approaches in inequity-averse optimization under uncertainty, the ex-ante approach and the ex-post approach, from a static to a dynamic decision making context. This is done by developing a stochastic multistage optimization framework evaluating payoffs by an equitable aggregation function. It is shown that global optimization of strategies leads to time-consistent policies only in the ex-post case. For the ex-ante case, a variant of a policy for which time consistency holds is proposed. To illustrate the concepts, a two-stage stochastic location–allocation problem from humanitarian logistics is investigated. For this application, the general algorithmic approaches can be cast into mathematical programming formulations, which yields a two-stage stochastic program and a bilevel program in the ex-post and in the ex-ante case, respectively. The resulting models are solved to optimality for a set of randomly generated instances, and a comparison of the outcomes for ex-post and ex-ante, also in terms of the “Price of Fairness”, is given.}

This paper aims to provide an analytical model that will help relief organizations in reducing human suffering following a disaster while maintaining an acceptable level of cost efficiency. A mathematical model is introduced to optimize the relief distribution problem which considers the social cost —the total sum of logistics and deprivation costs. The fuzzy nature of the deprivation cost function is addressed with possibilistic mixed integer programming with fuzzy objectives to reflect variation in deprivation costs perceptions. The model is solved using the Rolling Horizon method in a sequence of iterations. In each iteration, part of the planning horizon is modeled in detail and the rest of the time horizon is represented in an aggregated manner. The model is tested both empirically and on a case study of internal displacement in northwest Syria. Computational results showed that considering the demographic structure in affected areas and reflecting it to the deprivation cost function helped to reach better prioritization in distribution of commodities. The rolling horizon methodology is also found to be efficient in solving large scale instances and in capturing the dynamic changes in demand and supply parameters.}

The problem consists of delivering goods from one depot to a set of satellites and from there to a group of customers. The most common problem is known as the two-echelon vehicle routing problem (2E-VRP), which is known to be computationally difficult to solve. In real-life, uncertainty in travel times increases this complexity to actually define a delivery schedule. To deal with this stochastic behavior, this paper proposes a solution approach based on a combination of simulation and optimization, named simheuristic, to solve the 2E-VRP with stochastic travel times. The model also considers the CO2 equivalent and fine particles emissions. Experiments are run using real data of a French delivery company for the city of Paris. The performance of two scenarios for freight delivering is evaluated, and the results show that a global optimum gives better results than local optima. Policy makers need to take this into account when defining city policy on freight transport.}

The full 4E impacts include the design and trials, order management, material preparation, manufacturing, cold chain logistics, low-temperature storage, crowd management and end-of-life waste management. A life cycle perspective is necessary for sustainable vaccination management because a prolonged immunisation campaign for COVID-19 is likely. The impacts are geographically dispersed across sectors and regions, creating real and virtual 4E footprints that occur at different timescales. Decision-makers in industry and governments have to act, unify, resolve, and work together to implement more sustainable COVID-19 vaccination management globally and locally to minimise the 4E footprints. Potential practices include using renewable energy in production, storage, transportation and waste treatment, using better product design for packaging, using the Internet of Things (IoT) and big data analytics for better logistics, using real-time database management for better tracking of deliveries and public vaccination programmes, and using coordination platforms for more equitable vaccine access. These practices raise global challenges but suggest solutions with a 4E perspective, which could mitigate the impacts of global vaccination campaigns and prepare sustainably for future pandemics and global warming.}

Yet, just a few cases are reported and these have been operated during limited time. We offer here an explanation, by departing from the operational research models used to date, where collaborative contracts are signed when both quantities and prices are fixed. In this paper, we consider a coalition formation game but before market equilibrium; that is, we propose a collaborative model in which, after the agreements are signed, different firms and coalitions compete in multiple markets in Cournot fashion. When this happens, the formation of one set of coalitions affects prices and production levels of all other competitors. We propose multiple models to respond the question of which coalitions would form in this setting, including stability constraints and the restriction that antitrust authorities should accept the agreement. Our main finding is that opposed to what has been found in the literature to date, forming coalitions that are beneficial to firms in the agreement and at the same time be susceptible to be cleared by antitrust authorities is quite hard. We also assess computational time issues for larger instances.}

As Local Authorities can use floating vehicle data (FVD), which are a current trend in mobility management, gaining new knowledge from data could be crucial to help the various stakeholders to better address their needs. Accessibility in urban areas is investigated through travel time estimations along the most frequently used routes connecting relevant nodes of the city and their average speed using a simplified road network model. After the description of the principal elements of the method, a test case is also presented for the urban area of Turin, Italy, to demonstrate the applicability of the procedures on a real scenario and dataset. The results confirm, also through the use of skim matrices, the value of FVD in assessing the accessibility of different zones interested in delivery operations, which may change over time, providing monitoring functions to urban logistics operators and Local Authorities in managing urban freight flows.}

In this context, sidewalk autonomous delivery devices (ADDs) show great potentialities to decrease carriers’ last-mile operation costs. Nevertheless, because their speed, size and range will be limited, ADDs seem more adapted to the delivery of small items. The objective of this paper is to estimate the carrier’s total operation costs in a dual delivery channel. If its size is lower than a given threshold, the parcel is delivered to the customer via a logistics micro-hub and ADDs. Otherwise, if the parcel is bigger than the given threshold, it is delivered through a conventional supply chain with delivery vans. The carrier’s total operation costs are the sum of the costs induced by the two distribution channels. Assuming that the parcel size follows a known probability distribution function, the carrier’s total operation costs are estimated using the continuous approximation methodology. Different probability distribution functions modelling the size of the parcels are studied in the paper. Finally, the dual distribution channel is optimized considering the size threshold as a decision variable of the system.}

Apart from that, forwarders play a significant role in efficient coordination of deliveries. These aspects become particularly important when such processes take place within urban areas. The specific nature of distribution processes implementation in cities is determined by both the complexity of transport networks and considerable interactions with other users of the road infrastructure, as well as the environmental and social aspects. This article aims to presenting the role of carriers in elimination of hindrances, in order to ensure efficient implementation of distribution processes in cities. To ensure the efficient functioning of the logistics chain it is necessary to identify any restrictions affecting the execution of transport and forwarding orders.}

In this work an interactive simulation is proposed as a playful tool to disseminate theoretical results from academia and lessons learned towards non-experts, who can easily interact with a model. The proposed interactive simulator aims at helping actors to broadly share and enlarge their perspective about a specific problem. That is, identifying the different objectives and constraints of other actors and converging towards a collective solution to the problem at hand. A trial was performed with 28 participants that explored and compared two different distribution schemes using interactive simulation.

One of the most popular city logistics schemes is probably the Urban Consolidation Centre, which aims to reduce the number of freight movements in urban areas through consolidation of goods and optimisation of deliveries. Due to its potential to reduce the negative impact of urban freight transport, the consolidation centre has been widely supported by local, national, and European authorities. However, there is a lack of performance evaluation (ex-post analysis) and little research on methods and tools to evaluate and quantify the actual benefits. This research work proposes a model based on a set of indicators that allow assessing the efficiency and effectiveness of an Urban Consolidation Centre in terms of costs, time, quality, productivity, and environmental sustainability. Ex-ante and ex-post evaluations are performed through a case study approach to validate the model. Results show that the model is suitable to both applications and can be customised to deliver tailored performance evaluations.}

It demonstrates the rise of Zhengzhou from small town to megacity. This transformation has occurred in less than seven decades with Zhengzhou benefiting from its geographic importance and its position as a provincial capital in China's hierarchical system of government. While western accounts typically focus on the role of market forces and agglomeration economies in explaining the rise of megacities, we show the role of political decisions in explaining the growth of Zhengzhou as an international centre for manufacturing, commerce and logistics. The paper concludes that innovation and reform in regional governance, particularly to deal with emerging challenges, are necessary, if it is to develop a well-functioning megacity.}

Our first objective is to investigate the scopes, objectives, solution methodologies, and data types in the reviewed papers. The second objective is to analyse the indicators used in the proposed quantitative models and how they are related to sustainability and green criteria in the vehicle routing field. These criteria are adapted from Elkington’s (2001) triple bottom line (TBL) approach that emphasizes economic, environmental, and social dimensions. The final objective is to examine the findings of the studies, identify gaps in the related literature, and suggest directions for future research. One of the key findings of this study is that the economic dimension is the prominent driver among the three pillars of sustainability. The researchers relatively less address the environmental and social dimensions. It is determined that the social indicators are the least studied sub-dimension of sustainability. The results of this study are thought to help researchers and practitioners to learn more about the methods and models of sustainability or green practices, the metrics used, and the economic, environmental, and social results.}

To tackle the free shipping pitfall, separating the shipping fee from product price is worth noticing, which is especially encouraged by the world’s largest e-commerce market – China’s government. Since online consumers have been used to free shipping, the shipping fee could cause cart abandonment. To encourage a positive response, we propose a united persuasion model to analyze consumer attitudes toward a separate shipping fee. Several signals and personal factors are assumed to determine consumer attitude change through the perceived monetary value of logistics service. Result reveals that pursuit of high quality negatively affects perceived monetary value. Also, differences exist between consumers who consider the cost for products and that for logistics service fungible and those who do not, suggesting boundaries among budgets for logistics service can be leveraged. Our study conduces to the improvement of e-commerce logistics service and provides direction for information interaction-related studies.}

We address an integrated location-routing problem with post-disaster relief distribution, seeking to design an assignment system for a fleet of homogeneous rescue vehicles from a set of candidate depot locations to deliver relief supplies to affected areas after a disaster. Each affected area is associated with a soft time window, during which it is expected to receive the relief supplies. Two objective functions are involved: the penalty for time window violation, and the total operational cost comprising the depot opening cost, vehicle fixed cost, and transport cost. The overall objective to find the opened transfer depots, the number of vehicles used, and the route of each used vehicle so as to identify the approximate Pareto frontier comprising the trade-offs between the conflicting objectives. To achieve this, we develop a hybrid ant colony optimization algorithm for which we use particles as operators to more widely search for enabled depots among alternative ones and then assign clients to them so that ants can find the most effective and balanced vehicle routes for every selected depot. We conduct extensive numerical experiments to assess the performance of the developed algorithm by comparing with three algorithms. The numerical results confirm the efficacy of the developed method in terms of its computational efficiency and solution quality.}

On the negative side, these strategies require a subsequent order consolidation to separate the customer orders. In a widespread setup implemented by many online retailers put walls are applied to consolidate orders manually. A batch of orders picked under a batching and/or zoning strategy and, thus, distributed over multiple bins arrives via a conveyor system in the consolidation area. Here, a logistics worker retrieves the items from the successively arriving bins and—guided by a put-to-light mechanism—places them into the put wall. The wall is a simple reach-through rack separated into multiple shelves each temporarily dedicated to a specific customer order. On the other side of the wall reside packing workers, who empty shelves and pack completed orders into cardboard boxes. We aim to optimize the bin sequence in which a batch arrives at the consolidation area, such that the probability of starving packers waiting idle for completed orders is reduced. For this purpose, we formulate the batched order bin sequencing problem and derive suited optimization procedures. In our computational study, we investigate under which circumstances optimized bin sequences are especially valuable to reduce the packers' idle times.}

To achieve this objective, the author has proposed a mathematical model and discrete event simulation study. For the simulation model, the shortest distance has been selected. According to the extensive simulation analysis approximately 23 % of distance waste could be reduced in freight delivery to storage area. Of course, this number depends significantly on a warehouse layout, operations and material handling equipment used in warehouses.}

In this study, we address a service network design problem of a hub-and-spoke structured express transportation network during periods of surging demands. We consider a new strategy of upgrading existing spokes into temporary hubs to expand the network capacity with low costs. We propose a two-stage bi-objective robust model based on a time-space network to integrate the spoke-upgrading selection, service-scheduling, and vehicle-routing for designing an express service network that is both efficient and economic. To solve the model, we develop an enhanced column-and-constraint generation algorithm. Finally, a case study of a real express logistics company in China is demonstrated to validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy and to offer decision support in real problems.}

abstract = {In collaborative logistics, carriers form coalitions in order to perform parts of their operational business jointly. Combinatorial auctions can be used to exchange transportation requests without having to reveal critical information. Collaborators submit requests for exchange to a common pool. The requests in the pool are then grouped into bundles either by the auctioneer or by the carriers themselves, and offered for auction. While in the literature it is mostly assumed that both bundling and bidding is done by the carriers, our study shows that bundles built by the auctioneer under incomplete information can yield significantly higher collaboration profits, and allow for a lower number of bundles to be generated. However, even if the number of traded bundles is decreased by only offering some promising auctioneer bundles, the carriers have to present their bids for all the offered bundles. Typically, a bid is based on the carrier’s marginal profit. Hence, for each bid, an NP-hard routing problem has to be solved. To decrease this enormous computational effort, we develop different approximate bidding strategies. We show that for the single vehicle case, very simple bidding strategies are sufficient: they allow to reduce the computational time of the auction process by an order of magnitude, with no significant loss in collaboration profit. For multiple vehicles, however, our research shows that more sophisticated bidding strategies are recommended. Finally, we introduce a new profit sharing method, which is computationally tractable, guarantees individual rationality and does not require that critical information is revealed.}

As a consequence, logistics and transportation operators are subject to a noticeable pressure to develop efficient delivery systems. These systems are also influenced by the global trend towards more sustainable transportation and mobility, which implies changes in urban policies and technological innovations –e.g., the substitution of traditional diesel petrol-drive vehicles by electric ones. This paper analyzes the current and predicted needs of logistics operators in the Barcelona metropolitan area. To do so, urban regulations are analyzed and key shareholders are interviewed. The analysis of these interviews promote a discussion on how the use of new ‘agile’ optimization algorithms –which are based on the combination of biased-randomized heuristics, computer parallelization techniques, and IoT / 5G technologies– can contribute to enhance urban distribution practices. Finally, we present a case study in which the effect of different configurations of working/resting times and parking areas availability on routing solutions is studied. Our research aims to provide comprehensive knowledge to managers and policy-makers, and to offer them with powerful tools capable of generating real-time solutions to complex last-mile delivery challenges under dynamic conditions.}

Subsequently a vehicle routing problem with time windows is formulated in order to optimize the freight distribution at urban level completing the exploration of two aspects, infrastructures and management of the service, considered fundamental for dealing with the distribution of freight in a system scenario. The article describes a case study for the delivery of freight within the last mile in which the installation of renewable energy production plants is proposed in the same place where the urban distribution center has been planned. The area dedicated to freight handling is thus proposed in the work as an energy platform as well as logistics. The optimization of a freight delivery service is performed in order to reduce the energy used by the vehicle in its daily travels and some aspects related to the governance (i.e. time windows allowed for the delivery/pick-up operations) are included in the problem constraints.

This study updated the atmospheric mercury emission inventory in 2015 based on the most recent information on plant-specific air pollution control devices (APCDs) and coal consumption for 45 sectors in 215 Chinese cities. Total emissions were estimated at 218 t with an uncertainty range of − 54.0% to 147%, to which coal-fired industrial boilers (CFIBs) contributed 58.1%, followed by coal-fired power plants (CFPPs, 32.7%). Mercury emissions varied significantly among cities, ranging from 0.0218 to 6.89 t. The Logistics Mean Division Index (LMDI) model was then applied to identify key factors driving mercury emission changes in 50 representative cities from 2010 to 2015. Although coal consumption increased by nearly one fifth across the 50 cities, their total emissions declined by 2.36%, largely due to energy structure adjustments and widespread installations of more efficient APCDs. However, key drivers of mercury mitigation differed widely between the cities, being driven by energy intensity improvements in Chongqing and Guangzhou (Guangdong province) and by energy structure adjustments in Wuhan (Hubei province) and Yinchuan (Ningxia province). Mitigation strategies should be tailored to reflect these differences.}

It becomes more challenging for cities in developing countries that may have limited resources at hand. To study the impact of industrial freight on cities' overall traffic, a case study of the textile industry of Surat is taken up. Surat houses one of the biggest textile industries in India and it has grown organically across the city. In this study, freight trip generation models are developed based on the data collected from establishment surveys at the textile manufacturing units and commercial vehicle drivers' survey. Textile industry induced freight trips are estimated from the models and validated with field data. The impedance of the textile freight movement on the overall traffic flow is also measured using traffic volume studies. The study presents a ready-reckoner to forecast the number of freight trips based on floor area and employees, which can enable policymakers to plan the city's infrastructure for its sustainable growth and co-existence with the textile industry. City logistics would improve considerably if the textile freight traffic is gradually reduced from the city center and ring road area.}

abstract = {This paper studies a setting in emergency logistics where emergency responders must also perform a set of known, non-emergency jobs in the network when there are no active emergencies going on. These jobs typically have a preventive function, and allow the responders to use their idle time much more productively than in the current standard. When an emergency occurs, the nearest responder must abandon whatever job he or she is doing and go to the emergency. This leads to the optimisation problem of timetabling jobs and moving responders over a discrete network such that the expected emergency response time remains minimal. Our model, the Median Routing Problem, addresses this complex problem by minimising the expected response time to the next emergency and allowing for re-solving after this. We describe a mixed-integer linear program and a number of increasingly refined heuristics for this problem. We created a large set of benchmark instances, both from real-life case study data and from a generator. On the real-life case study instances, the best performing heuristic finds on average a solution only 3.4% away from optimal in a few seconds. We propose an explanation for the success of this heuristic, with the most pivotal conclusion being the importance of solving the underlying p-Medians Problem.}

abstract = {Urban freight transport is an important enabling factor for economic growth and social activities in cities but despite its benefits, it also generates important negative externalities including traffic congestion, pollution, noise and overall less safety. Moreover, increased limitations on urban freight transport, including access constraints, limited kerbside and private parking spaces for loading/unloading, and the often prohibitive costs of installing logistics infrastructures in city centres, have further constrained urban freight transport. To address these issues, several city logistics solutions have been proposed, such as two-tier distribution systems and distribution systems based on mobile depots. In this paper, we focus on two-tier urban freight distribution systems based on mobile depots, where little or no physical infrastructure is considered and where storage is not permitted at transfer locations. In these types of systems, coordination and synchronisation between vehicles are essential, and the main objective is to have vehicles at the transfer locations in a need-to-be basis as a way of minimising the negative externalities. We review and analyse 13 cases found in the scientific literature, trial reports and online resources, and propose a classification of these systems based on the level of mobility and accessibility of transportation modes operating at the first-tier. Furthermore, we characterise the main components and operational features of the different systems, including the existence of multi-trips, the types of transport modes used at both tiers, transported loads and the organisation of the transfer sites (satellites). This work aims to contribute for a clearer characterisation of two-tier urban distribution systems based on mobile depots, to later support the development of the most adequate mathematical models and solution methods to be applied to each variant of this type of systems.}

In this paper, we investigate changes in everyday life practices when private car commuting is replaced with a shared mobility alternative, integrating lightweight small size electric vehicles (LEVs) in a peer-to-peer shared mobility service. Through a living lab experiment, a long-term empirical study with 16 individual households in Sweden was conducted employing a mixed methods approach. Using social practice theory as an analytical lens, we interrogate in depth the process of change in users’ everyday lives to understand challenges in integrating shared mobility services into everyday practice, and the implications for transition towards sustainable mobility practices from a user’s everyday life point of view. The results show that a new mobility service can play a role in reconfiguring the meaning of private car commuting in terms of its related impacts, as well as increase knowledge and trust in sustainable alternatives. However, integrating shared mobility services in everyday practices showed that it became difficult to manage after six months, particularly for users with children. Our study demonstrates that current everyday life logistics, time affluence, and effort requirements are critical variables for enabling practice changes towards more sustainable mobility alternatives, such as a light electric vehicle sharing service. To enable people to reduce private car use, a more integrated and systemic design approach is needed for alternatives to become competitive with the notion of cars in everyday mobility.}

Freight logistics operations in Europe are struggling with ways to reduce their carbon footprints in order to adhere to regulations on governing logistics, while providing the increasing demand for sustainable products from the customers. This study investigates the anonymised microdata from the European Road Freight Transport Survey (2011–2014) to acquire patterns in logistic operations based on over 11 million journeys within 27 EU and EFTA countries involved. Different algorithms were implemented (Horizontal Cooperation, Pooling and Physical Internet) to analyse efficiency, in terms of vehicle utilisation, degree of vehicles’ loading during each journey and sustainability in terms of the amount of CO2 emissions per journey. This study shows that existing data can provide invaluable information on the efficiency of logistics operations and the positive effects data analytics can provide. Physical Internet algorithm has performed better in terms of reducing emissions and improving the logistics’ efficiency, especially when the sample sizes are large, but this would require a shift to an open global supply web.}
