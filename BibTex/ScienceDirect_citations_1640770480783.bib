abstract = {Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is a promising technology for the production of renewable biocrude from a variety of biomass. Experiments with different biogenic wastes such as sewage sludge, food and green waste and grease residue were performed to assess their suitability for hydrothermal liquefaction either as individual material or in physical mixtures with microalgae biomass (= hydrothermal co-liquefaction). The experiments were carried out in a high pressure batch autoclave at temperatures of 350 °C, a holding time of 15 min in nitrogen-atmosphere and a dry matter content of 10%. Mass balances revealed the yields of the four HTL-phases (biocrude, gaseous, solid and water phase). Additional analyses comprise Soxhlet-extraction to determine the lipid content of the raw materials, FTIR spectroscopy for HTL-gas phase composition as well as determination of calorific values and elemental compositions for raw material and respective biocrude samples. The following biocrude yields were achieved for the individual raw materials: green waste - 4.4%; sewage sludge - 12.0%; food waste - 18.2%; grease residue - 76.3%; chlorella vulgaris - 18.3%. Co-liquefaction effects for binary physical mixtures (50:50) of the biogenic residues with chlorella vulgaris could not be observed on a statistically significant basis. Hence, for the investigated samples, co-liquefaction is an option to reduce logistics costs and ensure sufficient and constant raw material mixtures for processing rather than increasing the biocrude yields by synergistic effects during Co-HTL.}

More and more restrictions on the use of fossil derived fuels may open the way for an increased consumption of biomass event those so far not perceived as feasible, such some biomass residue. Energy derived from biomass residues may provide even more benefits because it may replace other sources of higher-grade energy while providing proper destination for residues. Biomass from pruning residue has been overlooked as an energy resource due to many limitations. This paper addresses the issue and the means for energy valuation of pruning residues while provides final destination for them. It presents a framework to overcome most of today's challenges across the world. A case study was carried out to determine the main constraints and how they can influence the decision-making process. The variety of urban pruning residues and their rate of generation, handling, storage, logistics, economic and environmental issues, institutional regulations for a small city in Southern Brazil were taken into consideration in the analysis. Pruning residues were sampled in the field, then handled, shredded, dried, specified, stored and burnt in a concurrent woodburning furnace for testing. The diagnostics of the constraints and the lab tests were summarized and organized in a framework that aimed to assess the energy valuation of pruning residues. Results show that with proper assessment tools, projects, biomass analyses and burning technology energy valuation of pruning residues can be feasible.}

abstract = {Many supermarkets and retailers use computer assisted ordering (CAO) or automated order systems (ASO) to determine replenishment quantities. Traditionally, these systems are designed for non-perishables, and order quantities are set by (modified) base stock policies, determined according to the total number of units in stock, regardless of the ages of the products in stock. Today's technology allows the user to keep track of the age of inventories. In the last decade, a few so-called stock-age dependent order policies have been proposed. An optimal stock-age dependent policy may be computed by stochastic dynamic programming (SDP), but an SDP policy is hardly ever adopted in practice for two reasons: (1) the policy can only be computed if the underlying state space is not too large, and (2) the resulting policy can have a complicated structure. In practice, logistics managers prefer well structured policies they do understand, such as base stock policies (BSP). In this paper, we give an overview of existing stock-age dependent order policies and provide new stock-age dependent order policies. We present a simulation-based search procedure and suggest search ranges for setting optimal parameter values. For a broad set of 11,177 instances, we test the algorithm, compare these policies by simulation, and discuss the value of stock-age information. A new policy, named BSP-low-EW, performs close to optimal (SDP) and turns out to outperform all other policies in virtually all cases.}

ADS have opened up possibilities to improve mobility, productivity, logistics planning, and energy consumption. However, further enhancements in productivity and energy consumption are required to reach CO2–reduction goals, owing to increased demands on transportation. In particular, in the freight sector, incorporation of automation with electrification can meet necessities of sustainable transport. However, the profitability of battery electric heavy vehicles (BEHVs) remains a concern. This study found that ADS led to profitability of BEHVs, which remained profitable for increased travel ranges by a factor of four compared to that of BEHVs driven by humans. Up to 20% reduction in the total cost of ownership of BEHVs equipped with ADS could be achieved by optimizing the electric propulsion system along with the infrastructure for a given transportation task. In that case, the optimized propulsion system might not be similar to that of a BEHV with a human driver. To obtain the results, the total cost of ownership was minimized numerically for 3072 different transportation scenarios that showed the effects of travel distance, road hilliness, average reference speed, and vehicle size on the incorporated electrification and automation, and compared to that of conventional combustion–powered heavy vehicles.}

Motivated by a case study in the food supply chain, this paper examines a lateral collaboration between a leading retailer (LR), a third party logistics provider (3 PL) and different producers. Three collaborative strategies may be implemented simultaneously, namely pickup-delivery, collection and cross-docking. The collaborative pickup-delivery allows an entity to serve customers of another in the backhaul trips of the vehicles. The collaborative collection allows loads to be picked up at the producers in the backhauling routes of the LR and the 3 PL, instead of the traditional outsourcing. The collaborative cross-docking allows the producers to cross-dock their cargo at the depot of another entity, which is then consolidated and shipped with other loads, either in linehaul or backhaul routes. The collaborative problem is formulated with three different objective functions: minimizing total operational costs, minimizing total fuel consumption and minimizing operational and CO2 emissions costs. The synergy value of collaborative solutions is assessed in terms of costs and environmental impact. Three proportional allocation methods from the literature are used to distribute the collaborative gains among the entities, and their limitations and capabilities to attend fairness criteria are analyzed. Collaboration is able to reduce the global fuel consumption in 26% and the global operational costs in 28%, independently of the objective function used to model the problem. The collaborative pickup-delivery strategy outperforms the other two in the majority of instances under different objectives and parameter settings. The collaborative collection is favoured when the ordering loads from producers increase. The collaborative cross-docking tends to be implemented when the producers are located close to the depot of the 3 PL.}

To this end, a multi-objective mixed integer linear programming model is developed to jointly determine the best suppliers, and purchasing quantities along with the number and type of transportation modes. Three important objective functions, i.e., total logistics costs, total late deliveries and total value of purchasing are optimized in our proposed mathematical model.

A novel flexible-possibilistic programming approach is proposed to cope with the epistemic uncertainty and the flexibility of constraints based on the expected value and chance constraint programming concept.

abstract = {Objective
Pharmacists from The University of British Columbia Pharmacists Clinic provide comprehensive medication management services once to twice a month through the co-location model at multiple general practice clinics beginning from 2014 and consistently since 2016. For some of the clinics, this was the first experience with a co-located allied health professional. The objective of this study was to examine the perspectives of physicians who had a relatively long-standing relationship with a co-located pharmacist to identify barriers and facilitators to integrating a clinical pharmacist.
Methods
A qualitative research methodology was used to gain the perspectives of physicians. Data were collected through convenience sampling and one-on-one semistructured interviews. In-person or telephone interviews were conducted from August 12, 2019, to September 10, 2019, and audio was recorded with the participants’ consent. The recorded interviews were transcribed, and a thematic analysis with an inductive approach was used to analyze the data.
Results
Eight physicians from 4 general practice clinics were interviewed. Analysis of the interviews identified 6 themes that contained barriers or enablers to the integration of a co-located pharmacist: (1) electronic medical record (EMR) use, (2) identifying patients and the referral process, (3) workload and logistics, (4) patients’ willingness, (5) impact of in-person communication, and (6) shifting physicians’ perspectives. The enablers included the use of an EMR to proactively identify patient referrals, a dedicated pharmacist workspace, a physician champion, and intentional scheduling of in-person physician-pharmacist case conferences. The barriers included identifying patients for referral, the lack of EMR interoperability, pharmacist availability, physician colleagues who were less committed to team-based care, and financial implications despite externally funded pharmacists.
Conclusion
The physician participants perceived several barriers and enablers to the integration of a pharmacist into their practice. The themes identified can be used to inform physicians and pharmacists on the integration process for team-based primary care.}

This study first analyzes the features of China's capture fisheries, and points out that its management tends to be more complex and difficult than any other country in the world. It goes on to describe the history of China's fisheries management and the development process of China's fisheries policies, recognizing the role of fisheries policies in guiding and promoting industrial production during the whole development process. With Fisheries Law of the People's Republic of China as the basic framework, China is thought to have initially formed a fisheries management system with a complete structure and powerful measures for constant improvement and reinforcement. Major systems and measures of China's fisheries management are summarized, with their corresponding effects being evaluated to a certain extent. China's continuous introduction of advanced fisheries management philosophies over the past decades, especially since the reform and opening up, plays an active role in securing the prosperity of the following five industries: aquaculture, capture fisheries, processing and logistics, enhancement, and recreational fisheries; more effort has been put into fisheries ecological environment restoration; and law-based governance capacity in fisheries has been significantly improved. However, due to the characteristics of China's fisheries, as well as the complex and uncertain nature of fisheries itself, certain prominent problems still remain in its capture fisheries. With reference to relevant fisheries development planning, the study concludes with a prospect that China's capture fisheries management will be steered towards the total catch control of fisheries resources and the intensification of resource conservation and ecological restoration.}

One of the main opportunity areas is the reduction in the overall cost of biofuel. An approach to reduce this cost is to design and implement a supply chain (SC) that considers the quality-related properties of the biomass as well as the economies of scale to minimize the logistics and quality-related costs. This problem is formulated as a hub location problem, which has been classified as an NP-hard problem, therefore, meta-heuristics are a suitable approach to solve this problem. We propose a hybrid meta-heuristic solution procedure to solve large-scale instances of a two-stage stochastic biomass-to-biorefinery hub-and-spoke network problem. This solution procedure is proposed to support the large-scale production and distribution of bioethanol by considering the variability in its moisture and ash contents. The hybrid method utilizes a simulated annealing-simplex method to find an initial solution and a tabu search-simplex method to improve the solution. Numerical experimentation was performed on a realistic case study in Texas. The results show that the hybrid procedure outperforms the standard L-shaped (LS) method. The meta-heuristic combining simulated annealing and tabu search with the simplex method (SATS-SM) achieved 2.48% lower costs and required 96.57% less time, on average, when compared to the results from using the LS.}

abstract = {Background
Imaging guidance for left atrial appendage (LAA) closure (LAAC) conventionally consists of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and fluoroscopy under general anesthesia (GA). Intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) can eliminate the need for GA, expedite procedural logistics, and reduce the patient experience to a simple venous puncture.
Objective
The purpose of this study was to define optimal ICE views and compare procedural parameters and cost of ICE vs TEE during LAAC with the Watchman device.
Methods
Optimal ICE views of the LAA for Watchman implant were delineated using Carto-Sound and 3-dimensional rendition of the LAA in 6 patients. Procedural and financial parameters of 104 consecutive patients with standard indications for LAAC undergoing Watchman implant using ICE guidance through a single transseptal puncture (n = 53 [51%]) were compared with those of TEE-guided implants (n = 51 [49%]) in 3 centers.
Results
Clinical characteristics were similar between the 2 groups. Total in-room, turnaround, and fluoroscopy times all were shorter using ICE (P <.05) under local anesthesia compared to the TEE group. Implant success was 100% in both groups without peri-device leaks or procedural complications. Follow-up TEE showed no significant peri-device leak in both groups. Total hospital charges for ICE with local anesthesia vs TEE were similar, as were total hospital direct and indirect costs. Professional fees were significantly lower with ICE and local anesthesia than with TEE because the charge of anesthesia staff was avoided.
Conclusion
ICE-guided Watchman implant is safe, feasible, and comparable in cost to TEE during LAAC with a Watchman device but avoids GA and expedites procedure turnaround.}

Drawing mainly on new institutional economics, our study offers insights into the institutional factors, at both the macro and meso levels, that influence the choice of inter-firm contracts for Chilean apple exports. First and foremost, it examines the influence of the Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) provisions included in trade agreements signed by Chile with its trade counterparts on the choice of alternative contracts displaying different degrees of completeness. It also focuses on the institutions in the importing countries, the legal institutions enforcing contracts, the efficiency of logistics and the effect of hidden informal rules such as corruption, on the choice between free consignment, minimum guaranteed and sale contracts. We also explore the private institutions, primarily linked to direct imports by supermarkets. The results of our econometric analysis show that less complete contracts, i.e. free consignment and minimum guaranteed arrangements, are chosen when exporting to countries with safe business environments and higher number of SPS provision in international trade agreements. On the contrary, when exporting to non-reliable countries, exporters tend to protect themselves through more complete contracts, i.e. sale contracts. We found evidence that direct exports to supermarkets are more prone to occur under sale contracts which suggest the dual function of contracts, both as a safeguard and as a coordination tool to adopt specific customers' requirements.}

The present study aims at evaluating the environmental and economic potential of different EoL RO direct recycling strategies at full scale. Therefore, a virtual recycling facility and its supply were projected in a case study assessed by Geographic information systems (GIS) within the Segura’s watershed (SWS). The region accumulates 42% of the Spanish desalination capacity. The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was referred to one recycled module at the secondary enduser location (functional unit). The system boundaries included the processes from the EoL-RO modules collection to the delivery of recycled products at the secondary endusers location. Nonetheless, it was mainly focused on the transport impact and the EoL-RO modules characterisation. Five ILCD-midpoint categories were analysed. Service Life Ratio (SLR) indicator was also assessed. LCA and SLR results pointed out an important potential environmental benefit of the recycling. The distribution of recycled modules had no relevance within regional and national scales. However, long hauls (>3100 km) could be limited by their contribution to climate change (GWP). Otherwise, membrane modules characterisation was evidenced as a limiting process for closest distributions by its contribution to Human Toxicity (HT-nc). A competitive recycled product selling price of 80 euro per module can be achieved with improvements in the characterisation techniques.}

Thermal satellite images and land-based meteorology can be combined to derive evaporation rates from large lakes. The Dead Sea is a large hypersaline lake that can be used to examine the utility of thermal satellite images along with land-based meteorology to assess evaporation rates. Sea surface tmperature was retrieved for a 12-month period using band 10 onboard Landsat 8. Monthly SST was combined with nearby land-based meteorology to estimate evaporation from the sea surface using a mass transfer method and two variations of the Penman procedure. The Mass transfer gave an annual evaporation rate of 1005 mm whereas the Penman and the Priestley-Taylor methods gave 1308 and 1140 mm, respectively. These values are commensurate with extensive field measurement and theoretically derived evaporation values. Analysis shows a tradeoff between wind speed increase over the smoother lake surface and the drop in the saturation water vapor pressure deficit across the lake-atmosphere boundary. Wind speed has profound effects on evaporation differences during the warm season but diminish appreciably in the cold season when the vapor pressure deficit is small. Thermal images were able to resolve the presence of large pockets of cool water over the Dead Sea resulting from freshwater input. Modifications to evaporation caused by freshwater input to a hypersaline lake are investigated from a thermodynamic perspective. The alteration to evaporation depends on the simultaneous departure of surface temperature and the activity of the brine.}

To describe the use of Lean in urology at Zuckerberg San Francisco General, a community safety-net and trauma hospital that serves as a major teaching site for the University of California San Francisco.
METHODS
We examined our process improvement activities from 2016 to 2018. Our Lean Daily Management System (DMS) includes a 15-minute team huddle (“urology Lean work”) of service residents, faculty, clinic and operating room nursing staff, and anesthesia liaisons. Our DMS also includes a 5-minute preoperative huddle. Besides team-building, urology Lean work surfaces logistics, safety or equipment improvement ideas, and ensures progress and completion of initiated projects.
RESULTS
Over a 2-year period we developed and completed 67 projects. Projects impacted the outpatient setting (57%), followed by the operating room (22%), the Urology service (12%), and inpatient setting (9%). We completed projects in the following domains: safety (26%), quality (22%), care experience (21%), workforce care and development (13%), equity (11%), and financial stewardship (7%). Urology Lean work reduced new patient clinic access time (119-21 days) and Bacillus Calmette-Guérin in clinic treatment time (180-105 minutes). The average proportion of urology on-time surgeries was better than the overall surgery on-time surgeries (71% v 61%).
CONCLUSION
Urology Lean work successfully applied DMS in a service specific yet holistic approach. Urology Lean work improved resident engagement in quality and safety endeavors and served as a DMS model throughout perioperative and clinic areas.}

Advances in information technology, digitalization, and new emerging concepts in logistics systems such as the physical internet are facilitating the exploitation of fast and economical on-demand inventory transshipments through shared supply resources, resulting in the broader employment of on-demand transshipments in retailing and the establishment of interconnected retail networks. In such environments, the inventory profile does not alone reflect the readiness of a retail center to satisfy a customer; rather, network availability must be considered in addition to in-stock products to fully account for the potential demand that a retailer can satisfy. We propose a new model to estimate product availability in a closed-form expression under uncertain demand and in the presence of customer substitution and inventory transshipment for an omnichannel retail network consisting of retailers distributing high-value substitutable products. Our model estimates product availability for all available shopping channels considering both in-stock and network availability while accounting for the trade-off between transshipment costs and the additional customer satisfaction gained through exploring more-distant alternatives. The results of implementing the model on a pilot project for a case of recreational vehicles show that monitoring and improving product availability by the proposed model can achieve a significant reduction in supply chain-induced lost sales.}

While the effectiveness of those policies is markedly affected by a strong social controversy, one missing element is the role that stakeholders engagement can play in identifying impacts and potential implementation strategies. This paper diverges from other commonly accepted approaches by allowing stakeholders evaluate a set of transport policies for improving air quality. The city of Madrid (Spain), where there is a clear intention to restrict traffic in its centre, was taken as case study. Local stakeholders were engaged in a series of semi-structure interviews and a final face-to-face workshop to evaluate the potential impacts, acceptability, and feasibility of eight transport policies. Results show two distinct viewpoints: stakeholders from public institutions and eco-mobility sectors; and stakeholders linked to retail, logistics, and car-sharing services. Consensus between those two groups was hard to achieve for three specific policies: (i) license-plate restrictions; (ii) charges to motor vehicles; and (iii) development of walking and cycling infrastructure. The paper outlines the methodological process, reflects on the usefulness of stakeholder engagement in the policy-making process, and concludes with a discussion on the acceptability of the evaluated transport policies in the local context of Madrid.}

Supply chain of any organization connects inputs to outputs ensuring production of finished goods and delivering them to consumers. Quantity of waste generated, carbon footprint, other emissions, air pollution, deforestation, labor welfare, and health and safety are generally considered as factors that affect the sustainability of any supply chain. Raising environmental and social concerns of governments has forced the organizations to rework on their supply chain and making them sustainable. The major focus is toward closing the loop of the supply chain in all possible ways. Sustainable supply chain management focuses on addressing the environmental, social, economic, and legal facets of supply chain and its components. Responsible sourcing and supply chain partnerships made the contemporary organizations to develop and practice the best green operations and logistics with better industrial standards for worker’s safety, environmental protection, and adopt business ethics to be socially responsible. This chapter will summarize the transformation of supply chains from linear to circular and circular to sharing in a clear and effective context of understanding the supply chain transformation. This chapter will also focus on ways to improving the supply chain sustainability by identifying perilous issues and areas of by using supply chain management and measurement tools available from different agencies in evaluating their current supply chain sustainability level, setting supply chain sustainability goals in par with the government regulations and recommendations, selecting sustainable suppliers to reduce the environmental risks, exploring the possibilities of sharing the networks, and also carbon offsetting by investing in environmentally friendly initiatives for organizations which cannot work on sustainable strategies.}

Crop-type maps are often derived by the supervised classification of satellite imagery using machine learning models. The choice of data sampled during the data collection phase of building a classification model has a tremendous impact on a model's performance, and is usually collected via roadside surveys throughout the area of interest. However, the large spatial extent, and the varying accessibility to fields, often makes the acquisition of appropriate training data sets difficult. As such, in situ data are often collected on a best-effort basis, leading to inefficiencies, sub-optimal accuracies, and unnecessarily large sample sizes. This highlights the need for new more efficient tools to guide data collection. Here, we address three tasks that one commonly faces when planning to collect in situ data: which survey route to select among a set logistically feasible routes; which fields are the most relevant to collect along the chosen survey route; and how to best augment existing in situ data sets with additional observations. Our findings show that the normalised Moran's I index is a useful indicator for choosing the survey route, and that sequential exploration methods can identify the most important fields to survey on that route. The provided recommendations are flexible, overcome the main logistical constraints associated with in situ data collection, yield accurate results, and could be incorporated in a mobile application to assist data collection in real-time.}

Perishable food supply chains (PFSC) perform under higher risks as they struggle against greater wastage and product life cycle issues along with the logistics, operational, financial, and health risks during the COVID-19 pandemic. While facing these contingencies, it is essential to formulate strategies in real-time. In this paper, we identify and analyze risk mitigation strategies for PFSC during the current pandemic. We have initially discussed the uncertainties and risks related to pandemic situations and subsequently identified risk mitigation strategies to manage PFSC in such situations. We prioritized the identified strategies using the fuzzy-best worst methodology (F-BWM). The BWM is a highly effective decision-making method with higher consistency. The fuzzy extension to the best worst method (BWM) helps in incorporating vagueness and fuzziness in the decision. As a result, F-BWM is an excellent approach to analyze risk mitigation strategies as the business contingencies in PFSC during this pandemic are unique, with the industry having only a few clear ideas about how best to mitigate them. Among the risk mitigation strategies, “collaborative management,” “proactive business continuity planning,” and “financial sustainability” are the top risk mitigating strategies. Other identified strategies are also extremely useful for varied environmental contingencies. Thus, this research has been underpinned by the contingency theory and discusses all mitigation strategies concerning the socioeconomic contingencies originating from COVID-19. This research is a novel effort in identifying and analyzing the risk mitigation strategies for enhancing the socioeconomic-ecological performance of PFSCs in meeting the sustainable development goal of healthy and safe food for everyone.}

abstract = {Hydrogen can be transported over long distances when stored in Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carriers (LOHC). This transport is possible under the following conversion steps: first, hydrogen is stored inside a LOHC molecule (exothermic hydrogenation) at the starting point of the provision chain. Then, the loaded LOHC can be stored and transported. At the point of consumption, hydrogen is released (endothermic de-hydrogenation) and the unloaded LOHC returns to the point of hydrogen production. The optimal LOHC for transport should be liquid at ambient conditions and show similar properties to crude oil-based liquids (e.g., diesel, gasoline). This allows for a stepwise implementation using the existing crude oil-based infrastructure. However, there is a large variety of different LOHCs and other competing transport options; e.g., the transport of compressed hydrogen gas in pipelines or the transport of liquefied hydrogen in tanker ships. Against this background, this paper investigates the energy consumption and costs of these different hydrogen transport options. Therefore, the production of hydrogen is considered in areas with favorable renewable energy sources, followed by international transport logistics, and a local distribution in Germany. The assessment shows that the distance and the way heat is supplied to de-hydrogenate the LOHCs - especially for methanol - define the cost performance compared to a transport of compressed or liquid hydrogen. If the heat needed for dehydrogenation is covered by waste heat, dibenzyltoluene (DBT) or toluene can show benefits in terms of efficiency and costs. Furthermore, the different transport systems have different specific niches in which they are competitive; i.e., no specific transportation chain is superior to all systems under all circumstances. Nevertheless, the assessment shows that long-distance transport favors LOHC, while short-distance transport via pipelines can be used for lower costs.}

To evaluate the expression levels of ALDH1A1, PDL1, and PDL2 in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients, and explore their clinical relevance in prognosis of patients with HNSCC.
Methods
Immunohistochemistry of ALDH1A1 and PD-L1/PD-L2 in 85 primary HNSCC patients was carried out. The expression level of PD-L2 was assessed with the modified Moratin’s immune response scoring (IRS) system. tumor proportion score (TPS) was defined as the percentage of viable tumor cells showing partial or complete membrane staining at any intensity. The chi-square test and Fisher’s exact test were used to analyze the associations between ALDH1A1 expression and clinicopathological features. The Spearman’s correlation was applied to analyze the correlation of ALDH1A1 expression with PD-L1/PD-L2 expression.
Results
kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the expression levels of ALDH1A1 and PD-L1/PD-L2 were inversely associated with recurrence-free survival (RFS; P = 0.001, 0.014, and 0.023, respectively). Moreover, expression levels of ALDH1A1 and PD-L1 were correlated with poor overall survival (OS; P = 0.002 and 0.039, respectively). Furthermore, multivariate logistics regression analyses demonstrated that expression level of ALDH1A1 was independently associated with shorter RFS (P = 0.013) and poorer OS (P = 0.014) in HNSCC patients, and the expression level of PD-L2 was only negatively associated with RFS (P = 0.041), rather than PD-L1. Spearman’s correlation analysis unveiled that expression levels of PD-L1 and PD-L2 were positively correlated with ALDH1A1 expression in HNSCC patients (P = 0.000 and 0.015, respectively). Especially, the patients with expression levels of ALDH1A1 and PD-L1 had the worst prognosis.
Conclusions
Our results indicated that ALDH1A1 is an independent prognostic factor in patients with HNSCC, and the expression level of PDL-1 may be involved in ALDH1A1-mediated poor prognosis in patients with HNSCC.}

They are used extensively in military and civil applications such as search and rescue, reconnaissance, monitoring of the environment and traffic, entertainment, and logistics. UAVs usually operate with the assistance of various communication protocols, such as MAVLink, UranusLink, UAVCan, from a remote control or a ground control station (GCS). These protocols of communication are used for messages exchange. These messages contain important UAV status information and control commands that are sent from GCS to the UAV and GCS to the UAV, although these protocols offer better communication. However, most of the messages are not subtle, and there is no delicate way to secure such messages and are vulnerable to several security threats, including man-in-the-middle attack, DoS attack, packet data injection attack, and eavesdropping. It can lead to severe consequences, for example, a UAV crash, stealing important military operation data, falsifying reports in a reconnaissance or search and rescue operation, and much more. A new secure communication protocol is therefore required to ensure that the necessary safety standards for the communication of UAVs are met. This chapter gives an overview of UAV, their working mechanism, types, different communication protocols which are used for communication among UAVs. It also discusses the issues related to these communication protocols and propose a new secure communication protocol for UAVs.}

Immunization supply chains (iSC) are essential for ensuring access to vaccines that prevent diseases. Guinea, Madagascar, and Niger initiated iSC system design efforts to conduct analysis of alternative supply chain scenarios to identify areas for improvement.
Methodology
Key stakeholders from Ministries of Health and immunization programs identified bottlenecks in the current iSC and prioritized five general design scenarios to model in each country. Scenarios included aspects of integration, changing supply chain levels and delivery frequency, ignoring administrative boundaries, and direct delivery. Primary and secondary data were collected and cleaned. Analysis was completed using Supply Chain Guru (Madagascar and Niger) and AnyLogistix (Guinea) modeling software to build a virtual representation of the iSC physical components and operating policies.
Results
Modeling results were compared using both quantitative and qualitative criteria (total operating costs, cost per dose, cold chain capacity, risk of mishandling, logistics burden on healthcare workers, feasibility to implement, and equity). Using a Stop Light Analysis for user-friendly understanding of positive, negative or minimal impact on scenarios, cost savings were realized in most scenarios in Madagascar (except using autonomous aerial vehicles); proposed scenarios in Guinea increased costs or had minimal impact; in Niger, eliminating regional tiers reduced costs. Facility level cold chain was sufficient in all countries. Effect on qualitative indicators largely depended on the scenario and country context.
Discussion
Similarities in scenarios selected were seen across the three countries. Results suggest that efficiencies can be found through changes to the iSC design, but the benefits of each scenario must be considered in the country context. Results of the analysis do not provide “the right answer” but rather options and guidance which then must be grounded in the country context and used as evidence for decision making to ensure reliable availability of vaccines.}

abstract = {Background
Pain associated with surgical or enzymatic burn wound debridement prevents many burn centres from working outside an operating theatre, creating a burden. Alternatives for general anaesthesia to manage pain in burn patients treated with enzymatic debridements, such as regional anaesthesia, have not been studied in detail. This study explores the different possibilities for pain management during a bedside NexoBrid™ procedure.
Material and methods
We performed a single-centre retrospective study that included 82 paediatric, adolescent, and adult patients with deep dermal and full-thickness burns treated bedside with NexoBrid™ under regional or general anaesthesia. Outcome measures were pain during the NexoBrid™ procedure, the safety of the anaesthesia and the NexoBrid™ procedure, logistics of the bedside NexoBrid™ procedure, and time to wound closure.
Results
Forty-three patients in the adult group (43/67, 64%) only presented with burn wounds on one upper or the one or two lower extremities. In 29 of them (29/43, 67%), a NexoBrid™ procedure was performed under regional anaesthesia, which resulted in low pain levels without any adverse events. All seven patients in the paediatric group, where only one upper or one or two lower limbs were involved (7/15, 47%), underwent a NexoBrid™ procedure performed under regional anaesthesia where no adverse events were reported. In these children, the use of regional anaesthesia was associated with a significant decrease in time to wound closure (average treatment effect on the treated = −22.5 days, p = 0.021).
Conclusion
This study highlights that regional anaesthesia administered at the bedside should be the method of choice for pain management during NexoBrid™ procedures because often, it can be adequately and safely performed in all age groups. This approach will reduce the burden on operating theatres. A flow chart has been developed to guide pain management during a NexoBrid™ procedure.}

Selecting which foreign market entry mode is an important internationalization strategic decision of firms and could have a considerable impact on the firm's performance. The CBEC mode emerges as a plausible choice: e-commerce has grown rapidly in many markets, particularly in China. Additionally, foreign firms face high transaction costs due to unfamiliar consumer behavior and institutional barriers. It is especially difficult for SMEs. This study deploys transaction cost theory as the underpinning framework to explain the motivations for selecting a CBEC entry mode. The findings suggest that CBEC could reduce uncertainties and opportunistic behaviors, while increasing trust. Foreign firms could lower their asset investment in physical shops, staff requirements and training, logistics and warehousing: these supports are provided by marketplace platforms. This new entry mode also takes advantage of the involvement and the dependency of intermediaries. In addition to providing market knowledge, technology providers help to build trust and reduce risks and thereby transaction costs, despite the high transaction frequency of e-commerce.}

abstract = {The Electric Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows and Stochastic Waiting Times at Recharging Stations is an extension of the Electric Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows where the electric vehicles (EVs) may wait in a queue before the recharging service starts due to limited number of chargers available at stations. Since the customers and the depot are associated with time windows, long waiting times at the stations in addition to the recharging times may cause disruptions in logistics operations. To solve this problem, we present a two-stage simulation-based heuristic using Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS). In the first stage, the routes are determined using expected waiting time values at the stations. While the vehicles are following their tours, upon arrival at the stations, their queueing times are revealed. If the actual waiting time at a station exceeds its expected value, the time windows of the subsequent customers on the route may be violated. In this case, the second stage corrects the infeasible solution by penalizing the time-window violations and late returns to the depot. The proposed ALNS applies several destroy and repair operators adapted for this specific problem. In addition, we propose a new adaptive mechanism to tune the constant waiting times used in finding the first-stage solution. To investigate the performance of the proposed approach and the influence of the stochastic waiting times on routing decisions and costs, we perform an experimental study using both small and large instances from the literature. The results show that the proposed simulation-based solution approach provides good solutions both in terms of quality and of computational time. It is shown that the uncertainty in waiting times may have significant impact on route plans.}

Ils ont assuré la détection et l’extraction de sept victimes des décombres, la levée de doute et une mise en sécurité de produits chimiques, une aide en logistique de produits de santé d’urgence, l’apport de soins à la population, ainsi que des expertises bâtimentaires d’urgence. Le détachement ForMiSC a pu, en urgence, mettre au service du peuple libanais ses expertises des catastrophes lors de cette intervention au caractère très polyvalent.
Summary
Tuesday August 4th 2020, in Beirut city, around 6 p.m. (local hour), a gigantic explosion ravages the Lebanon's capital. It is a warhouse fire which triggers an explosion of 2700 tonnes of ammonium nitrate. At the last review, Lebanon deplores 202 deaths and more than 6500 injured. It's one of the biggest and deadliest industrial explosions of this century. France sends immediately first rescue means: French Military Units of Civil Defence. In this context of coronavirus epidemic, this operation mixed expertises in medical urban search and rescue, technological and sanitary risks of this unit. The French rescuers detected and extracted seven deceased victims, detected and secured chemicals products, provide logistics assistance for health products, provided cares for the population, realized emergency building expertise. The detachment was able, urgently, to put its disaster expertise at the service of the Lebanese people during this multi role intervention.}

abstract = {We address for the first time a platform able to distil small volume of crude oil, providing the generation of oil fractions for succeeding composition analysis and accurate quantification of significant derivatives, i.e., naphtha, kerosene, and diesel, through true boiling point (TBP) curves and machine learning. While conventional systems are slow (2 to 3 days), sample-consuming (1 to 30 L), and require expensive equipment, simple and low-cost components such as thermocouples, fractionation column, external resistance on column region, and condenser were herein integrated into a glass piece to distillate 2 mL of oil in 6.7 h. In addition to assuring fractional distillation, a wire rope-packed column allowed the addition of samples without contaminating the inner glass walls. Systematic temperature programs were applied to oil and column, whereas the temperatures on the top of column were monitored to obtain TBP curves. The accuracy associated with the determination of oil derivatives was remarkably improved with the aid of a simple machine learning-modeled equation. By enabling diverse tasks such as definition of the type of petroleum, its market value, royalties, well throughput, and logistics for fuel transport, storage, and distribution, our distiller holds great potential for the petrochemical industry, in special during the drilling and prospecting of new exploratory wells when only small volumes of crude oil are commonly available. This platform also provides faster and safer analyses bearing lower energy demand and waste generation.}

Today's AGV-systems offered by global manufacturers almost all operate under some form of centralized control where a single central controller coordinates the entire fleet of AGVs. There is a trend towards decentralized control of these systems where AGVs make individual decisions that promote the flexibility, robustness and scalability of transport. However, its practical implementation seems to be in its infancy. In addition to the lack of practical implementation of decentralized control in industrial AGV-systems, we have observed a research gap in intelligent resource management of AGV-systems, which we have tried to address in previous work by proposing a more intelligent resource management approach. In this paper, we have addressed both the perceived lack of practical decentralized AGV control and the lack of intelligent resource management by proposing a decentralized task allocation algorithm based on sequential single-item auctions, taking into account resource constraints, and in which our intelligent resource management approach from previous work is introduced. We have benchmarked our new approach to a genetic algorithm-based task-allocation solver that uses “threshold-100”-charging as a resource management strategy. The result of the proposal is a decentralized task-allocation architecture under resource constraints that could be used in current AGV-systems to add more decentralized features to the fleet.}

abstract = {Objectives
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer. Many countries in Europe have already implemented systematic screening programmes as per the recommendations by the European Union. The impact of screening is highly dependent on participation rates. The aim of the study was to identify barriers, facilitators and modifiers to participation in systematised, stool sample–based, publicly financed CRC screening programmes.
Study design
Systematic review.
Methods
A systematic search in PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane CENTRAL, Google Scholar and PsycINFO was undertaken. We included both qualitative and quantitative studies reporting on barriers and facilitators (excluding sociodemographic variables) to participation in stool sample–based CRC screening. Barriers and facilitators to participation were summarised and analysed.
Results
The inclusion criteria were met in 21 studies. Reported barriers and facilitators were categorised into the following seven themes (examples): psychology (fear of cancer), religion (believing cancer is the will of God), logistics (not knowing how to conduct the test), health-related factors (mental health), knowledge and awareness (lack of knowledge about the test), role of the general practitioner (being supported in taking the test by the general practitioner), and environmental factors (knowing someone who has participated in a screening programme). Six studies reported that non-participation was not due to a negative attitude towards screening for CRC.
Conclusion
Many barriers to screening were found. It is important to work with peoples' fear of screening. Moreover, this review suggests that it might be possible to increase participation rates, if the population-wide awareness and knowledge of potential health benefits of CRC screening are increased and proper logistical support is provided.}

Questioning behavior is a type of intraoperative communication for which little information exists on the types of questions that residents ask. The purpose of this study is to describe and identify themes of questions asked by residents in the operating room.
Design
Trained observers documented questions asked by residents during operations. Thematic analysis was applied.
Setting
University of Utah Hospital (Salt Lake City, Utah) operating rooms; institutional.
Participants
A total of 10 general surgical residents (postgraduate year 1 to 5) were observed along with 10 attending general surgeons. Cases were purposefully selected to be broadly representative of general surgery cases.
Results
Thematic saturation occurred following examination of 16 operative cases, which included 178 questions asked by residents. Two broad categories of questions emerged: case-related (71%) and noncase-related (29%), with multiple subcategories within the 2 groups. Case-related subcategories included operative techniques, logistics, patient care, and other. Questions unrelated to the case included subcategories of social, work-related but unrelated to case, other. Less than 1% of questions asked by residents during operations were reflective.
Conclusions
Most questions related to the case were technical and most of those unrelated to the case were social; almost all questions were transactional in nature. Our identification of questioning themes by residents expands understanding of resident questioning behaviors, and therefore may enable residents and faculty to be more effective in establishing entrustment.}

The question is whether waste-to–hydrogen can become part of the zero-carbon future energy mix and serve as one of the cleaner hydrogen sources which is economically viable and environmentally friendly. This work critically assessed the potential of waste as a source of hydrogen production via various thermochemical (gasification and pyrolysis) and biochemical (fermentation and photolysis) processes. Research has shown hydrogen production yields of 33.6 mol/kg and hydrogen concentrations of 82% from mixed waste feedstock gasification. Biochemical methods such as fermentation can produce hydrogen up to 418.6 mL/g. Factors including feedstock quality, process requirements and technology availability were reviewed to guide technology selection and system design. Current technology status and bottlenecks were discussed to shape future development priorities. These bottlenecks include expensive production and operation processes, heterogeneous feedstock, low process efficiencies, inadequate management and logistics, and lack of policy support. Improvements to hydrogen yields and production rates are related to feedstock processing and advanced energy efficiency processes such as torrefaction of feedstock which has shown thermal efficiency of gasification up to 4 MJ/kg. This will affect the economic feasibility and concerns around required improvements to bring the costs down to allow waste to viewed as a serious competitor for hydrogen production. Recommendations were also made for financially competitive waste-to-hydrogen development to be part of a combined solution for future energy needs.}

Hydrothermal liquefaction is an energy-intensive process that operates at high temperature and pressure and produces a biocrude similar to conventional crude oil. The key advantages of installing hydrothermal liquefaction in proximity with a Kraft Mills enables the use of black liquor as a feed to hydrothermal liquefaction, asset repurposing and optimisation, as well as supply chain and logistics integration. This work follows a design process to increase the energy efficiency of the hydrothermal liquefaction process by using an iterative mass and heat integration procedure to optimise mass and energy flows and assets of the hydrothermal liquefaction process. The method uses process simulation tools, Pinch Analysis, heat exchanger network design tool, and the understanding of the process constraints to develop a heat exchanger network for the hydrothermal liquefaction process with maximum energy recovery, minimum number of units and enhanced mass integration. The number of heat exchangers in the network reduced from 14 to 7 when the proposed method was applied. Substituting bio-crude from the new integration hydrothermal liquefaction process for conventional fuels has the potential to decarbonise transport fuels by 11.3 kg CO2-e/GJ of fuel.}

abstract = {Introduction
Rapid outbreak response vaccination is a strategy for measles control and elimination. Measles vaccines must be stored and transported within a specified temperature range, but this can present significant challenges when targeting remote populations. Measles vaccine licensure for delivery outside cold chain (OCC) could provide more vaccine transport/storage space without ice packs, and a solution to shorten response times. However, due to vaccine safety and wastage considerations, the OCC strategy will require other operational changes, potentially including the use of 1-dose (monodose) instead of 10-dose vials, requiring larger transport/storage equipment currently achieved with 10-dose vials. These trade-offs require quantitative comparisons of vaccine delivery options to evaluate their relative benefits.
Methods
We developed a modelling framework combining elements of the vaccine supply chain - cold chain, vial, team, and transport equipment types - with a measles transmission dynamics model to compare vaccine delivery options. We compared 10 strategies resulting from combinations of the vaccine supply elements and grouped into three main classes: OCC, partial cold chain (PCC), and full cold chain (FCC). For each strategy, we explored a campaign with 20 teams sequentially targeting 5 locations with 100,000 individuals each. We characterised the time needed to freeze ice packs and complete the campaign (campaign duration), vaccination coverage, and cases averted, assuming a fixed pre-deployment delay before campaign commencement. We performed sensitivity analyses of the pre-deployment delay, population sizes, and two team allocation schemes.
Results
The OCC, PCC, and FCC strategies achieve campaign durations of 50, 51, and 52 days, respectively. Nine of the ten strategies can achieve a vaccination coverage of 80%, and OCC averts the most cases.
Discussion
The OCC strategy, therefore, presents improved operational and epidemiological outcomes relative to current practice and the other options considered.}

This paper proposes a real-time crash risk prediction model on arterials using a long short-term memory convolutional neural network (LSTM-CNN). This model can explicitly learn from the various features, such as traffic flow characteristics, signal timing, and weather conditions. Specifically, LSTM captures the long-term dependency while CNN extracts the time-invariant features. The synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) is used for resampling the training dataset. Five common models are developed to compare the results with the proposed model, such as the XGBoost, Bayesian Logistics Regression, LSTM, etc. Experiments suggest that the proposed model outperforms others in terms of Area Under the Curve (AUC) value, sensitivity, and false alarm rate. The findings of this paper indicate the promising performance of using LSTM-CNN to predict real-time crash risk on arterials.}

abstract = {This paper proposes an approach to develop schedules for charging batteries in a battery center. This problem arises in warehouses and logistics centers that attempt to provide uninterrupted operations with battery powered machinery such as stackers. These operations often require recharging batteries on location, a process that involves two decisions: determining charging start-times and assigning batteries to chargers. Prices of grid-provided electric energy vary by hour of the day and can be almost negligible for energy available from photovoltaic solar collectors. Thus, efficient schedules should recharge batteries during time intervals with low tariffs while minimizing the time batteries spend in queue waiting for an available charger. In this situation, batteries arrive at the battery center during the operation. The model assumes that the counts of arriving batteries in time bands are known. The objective is to determine a charging schedule that minimizes a weighted sum of the costs of energy and delays. We develop a MIP model that incorporates the main features of the battery charging process. Unfortunately, computation times to solve these MIPs are too long to be practical. To overcome this limitation, we develop a constructive heuristic that finds a feasible solution in a matter of seconds, even for large-sized instances, with a relatively low GAP of 9.67%.}

Distributed recycling can be thought of as a sort of “smart grid”, composed of small and coordinated recycling units. However, the operational complexity of this distributed approach limits its application. Furthermore, the environmental and economic advantages have yet to be demonstrated. This article therefore explores the economic and environmental feasibility of this distributed plastic recycling approach from a logistics perspective, as a step towards its validation. To achieve this, an optimization mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model was used as an evaluation tool, representing a local closed loop supply chain (CLSC) network. The proposed model is illustrated using a case study of a university seeking to implement a distributed recycling demonstrator in order to recover 3D printing wastes from secondary schools in the northeast of France. Following this step, a sensitivity analysis was carried out considering the market variations (price of virgin plastic filament) and the amount of available plastic waste derived from the schools. The results obtained show positive economic and environmental benefits of carrying out this new method of plastic recycling. This work serves as a basis for continuing to explore the feasibility and replication of the distributed plastic recycling network in other contexts.}

Resource efficiency includes the reduction of primary and non-renewable materials, the creation of high-quality products with minimal waste, and the retention of long-term product value. One potential source of resource efficiency is the increased adoption of industrialized housing construction which includes novel construction methods and products. Current literature identifies numerous opportunities for resource efficiency in industrialized housing construction. However, this literature is scattered across several sources and units of analysis. Using a Systematic Literature Review, this paper identifies eight recurrent product and process-related themes and fifteen specific subthemes of resource efficiency in industrialized housing construction across building lifecycle phases. These themes can be based on product such as the use of innovative and industrial materials or on process such as the use of inventory monitoring and tracking. Additional industry and regulatory themes are also identified. Furthermore using frequency analysis of literature, the paper finds while themes of resource efficiency exist across all building lifecycle phases, the most recurring themes occur in design, manufacturing and logistics phases. There is less literature dedicated to resource efficiency during occupancy and end-of-life phases. The paper further discusses how early design decisions such as material design have a systems-level impact that propagates throughout the building lifecycle, and how a beyond-systems approach is needed between stakeholders and processes to integrate current resource efficiency potentials into industrialized housing construction practice. Finally, the paper identifies future research directions for resource-efficient industrialized housing construction including concepts of circular economy, value chain coordination, and socio-economic impacts.}

In order to save energy, communication tasks are grouped in time. The WSN applications, such as control loops used in production lines, impose deadlines on the message delivery time. By introducing a grouping constraint, this paper extends the polynomial cyclic scheduling problem of building a periodic schedule with uniform precedence constraints and no resource constraints. We consider that each task belongs to one group, and each group is to be scheduled as a super-task in every period. We show two examples issued from different applications of such grouping constraints, using uniform constraints to model the deadlines expressed in the number of periods. We tackle the feasibility problem (the existence of a periodic schedule), which has shown to be independent of the processing times. We propose a graph formulation of the problem using the retiming technique. In the ZigBee case, we prove that the particular tree structure of the groups and of the uniform precedences based upon the communication tree, lead to a polynomial algorithm to solve the problem. But the general problem is proven to be NP-complete even if no additional resource constraints are considered, and unit processing times are assumed. This extension of the cyclic scheduling leads to a new range of grouping problems with applications, not only in communication networks but also in production and logistics scheduling.}

These objectives are in line with the European Union (EU) guidelines on reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, renewable energy share, and improvements in energy efficiency for climate change mitigation and adaptation policies. Based on the difference in energy consumption between optimized and unoptimized industrial processes, the economic benefits can be quantified in terms of GHG emission quotas, volume of fuel consumed, and the indirect benefits with respect to improving corporate brand image. The methodology presented here has been successfully applied to several real case studies covering different manufacturing processes, robotic operations, and products. The results show that higher profits and sustainable growth are achieved when this methodology is used. It helps design Flexible Manufacturing Systems (FMS) and leads to shorter working times and higher energy efficiency and annual profits. In addition, Pareto frontiers show the trade-off between profits and product manufacturing times for different case studies.}

abstract = {Purpose
To adapt an evidence-based coping skills training program to the cultural context and healthcare system for youth with T1D in China, and to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the modified program.
Design and methods
A multiphase process was used based on a heuristic framework for program modification. This included information gathering, preliminary adaptation, and feasibility evaluation.
Results
In Stage 1, the coping skills training protocol was translated and evaluated for relevance by the stakeholders (youth diagnosed with T1D, parents, and healthcare providers). Recommendations for revisions and culturally relevant scenarios were identified. In Stage 2, the program was adapted for youth with a wider age range. Scenarios and logistics of the program were changed, and a session on blood glucose management was added to enhance cultural relevance. In Stage 3, the feasibility of the modified program was evaluated with 15 youth participants diagnosed with T1D (mean age: 13.88 years). Problem-solving coping and the self-efficacy of the youth improved over time (p < .05). High attendance, engagement, and satisfaction were achieved.
Practice implications
The CST-China program has the potential to provide Chinese youth with T1D an interactive and engaging program to improve health outcomes. The adaptation process of a CST program can provide a reference for pediatric nurses to develop programs which are culturally relevant, acceptable to stakeholders, and aligned with the healthcare system in China.
Conclusions
A coping skills training program was systematically adapted and aligned to the healthcare system in China, with evidence of feasibility and acceptability in Chinese youth with T1D.}

abstract = {Background
In 2019, the World Health Organization released guidelines reflecting major changes in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) management—prioritizing fluoroquinolones, bedaquiline, and linezolid (LZD) while de-emphasizing previously favored injectable agents. In some cases, linezolid use is associated with gastrointestinal intolerance, mitochondrial toxicity, and significant drug interactions. CDC’s Division of Tuberculosis Elimination supports a network of regional TB Centers of Excellence, which provide medical consultation to healthcare providers. Consultations are documented in a medical consultation database (MCD) enabling evaluation of management questions and recommendations. We describe the scope of clinical inquiries and responses specific to linezolid use for MDR-TB in the US.
Research Question
What are the major themes of provider and patient challenges regarding the use of linezolid for the treatment of MDR-TB in the US?
Methods
We queried MCD consults categorized as “MDR/XDR-TB” from 1/1/2013 to 12/31/2018. Only linezolid-specific consultations were included; incomplete and duplicate entries were excluded as were those citing linezolid historically or theoretically. Subgroup characteristics were assessed (e.g., Center, year, provider type). A descriptive coding scheme was developed through inductive thematic analysis.
Results
In 2013–2018 of the 1889 consults regarding MDR/XDR-TB, 934 MDR-TB consults referenced linezolid; 137 met inclusion criteria, representing between 4 and 10% of MDR-TB consults annually. Four main themes emerged: adverse effects (71.5%); concerns about linezolid use due to co-morbidities or concurrent medication use (15.3%); dosing adjustments (8.8%); and monitoring and maintenance logistics (4.4%).
Interpretations
Linezolid consults consistently exceeded 4% of all consults annually over the 6-year period, suggesting a need for access to expert opinion for providers using linezolid to manage MDR-TB. While only a snapshot of MDR-TB in the US, this evaluation summarizes major provider concerns regarding particular adverse effects, and highlights a need for evidence-based guidance regarding linezolid dosing and toxicity management.}

Most OECD countries have not yet taken considerable steps to tackle this growing challenge. This paper projected the PV waste stream from the year 2001 to the year 2058, based on the historical PV installation in OECD countries using Weibull function and implementation of two forecasting scenarios of early-loss and regular loss. The significance of the findings reveal that the cumulative volume of the waste is estimated to vary from 25 to 28.5 Million Tons (MT) breaking down to the major waste flow such as base and special metals (4.58 MT) and other metals (2.37 MT), followed by nonmetal waste (25.69 MT) including glass and EVA by 68% and 26% respectively. There are a few countries which meet the minimum annual PV waste of 20 Kilo Tons (KT) between 2026 and 2027 to establish the treatment business solely; however, few other countries do not meet the minimum waste generation level until 2032 and have to join other member countries to run a joined treatment program. The gross value creation of the recovered waste materials (Billion USD 36–42) disclosed a very promising vision that would be an attractive incentive to involve all parties. Finally, proactive policy and management strategy are required to create new economic avenues to prosper competitive markets on the recovered materials leading to environmental and economic sustainability.}

The aim is to identify the network configuration with the least total cost subject to side constraints related to resource availability, technological conditions, and customer service level requirements. In addition to in-house manufacturing, end products may also be purchased from external sources and consolidated in warehouses. Therefore, our model identifies the best mix between in-house production and product outsourcing. To measure the impact of this strategy, we further present two additional formulations for alternative network design approaches that do not include partial product outsourcing. Several classes of valid inequalities tailored to the problems at hand are also proposed. We test our models on randomly generated instances and analyze the trade-offs achieved by integrating partial outsourcing into the design of a supply chain network against a pure in-house manufacturing strategy, and the extent to which it may not be economically attractive to provide full demand coverage.}

abstract = {Background
To achieve Measles and Rubella elimination and Polio Endgame goals, Tanzania implemented country-wide integrated Supplementary Immunization Activities (SIAs) in October 2019 involving two injectable vaccines of MR and IPV. The SIAs targeted children aged between 9 and 59 months for Measles-Rubella and 18 to 42 months for IPV vaccines. This article aims to share lessons learnt in the implementation of SIAs field guidelines in Tanzania in 2019 to inform future implementation of the SIAs within and outside the country’s boundaries.
Methods
Focus groups discussions (FGDs) were conducted among Regional Immunization and Vaccines Officers from all regions and National Supervisors and Partners responsible for implementing the SIAs. Key areas discussed were pre-planning activities, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the SIAs based on key thematic areas including; planning and coordination, logistics management, trainings, and demand creation. Pre-described templates were used to guide the discussion and keep record of the discussions.
Results
The SIAs achieved national target based on administrative coverage. This was due to a high sense of ownership of the SIAs and strong staff commitment to attain high coverage rates manifested through effective planning and coordination within and between levels; effective execution of SIAs activities; involvement of key stakeholders at all levels; and strong advocacy, communication and social mobilization activities. Despite the success observed through administrative coverage, the WHO target of attaining 95% coverage using the gold standard - national coverage survey, was not reached. The main barrier to success was inadequate and delayed disbursement of funding.
Conclusion
The 2019 SIA achieved high administrative coverage as a result of effective coordination; adequate micro-planning; timely logistical preparations; and effective demand creation activities. Future campaigns need to give high priority to hard-to-reach and densely populated areas during planning and ensure timely disbursement of funds to the operational level during implementation.}

Advanced age is associated with comorbidities and immune system impairment, which may influence the efficacy and tolerability of immune checkpoint inhibitors. There is evidence that anti-PD1 antibodies in advanced melanoma are equally effective in patients >65 years. However, data on patients >75 years are lacking as co-morbidities and logistics often exclude them from clinical trials.
Methods
We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of older patients with advanced melanoma undergoing any-line treatment with an anti-PD1 (nivolumab/pembrolizumab) to investigate its clinical effectiveness and toxicity in a real-life setting. Clinical response was assessed using RECIST criteria and toxicity was evaluated according to CTCAE 4.0. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method and the Cox model was used to assess potential prognostic factors.
Results
174 patients were considered; 59.2% males, median age 79 years (range 75–93). The majority had a performance status of 0 and normal lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels (55.2% and 52.4%, respectively). 69.1% had multiple co-morbidities. 56.9% received nivolumab. 36.7% of cases showed an objective response and the disease control rate was 56.3%. Median OS was 17.2 months [95% CI: 8.87-not reached] and a better prognosis was observed for patients with normal LDH (p < .001) and lower performance status (p < .001). Treatment was well tolerated, only 11 patients experiencing severe (grade 3/4) toxicity. There were no treatment-related deaths. Adverse events were managed with corticosteroids and additional immunosuppressive agents were unnecessary.
Conclusions
Anti-PD1 antibodies appear effective and well tolerated in older patients with advanced melanoma.}

abstract = {To ensure the competitiveness of Germany in the manufacturing of composite parts, greater resource efficiency and higher standards of quality are needed. The process of vacuum infusion is used by many companies to produce a great variety of composite parts for markets like shipbuilding, wind energy and many more. Often, those parts have a complex structure requiring a great amount of skill and experience to produce at a high quality. Therefore, the development process often requires several experimental trials before sufficient quality is reached, using up material and time. By using RFID (radio frequency identification) transponders as sensors, the manufacturing process can be monitored, and less reject is produced. When using RFID transponders as sensors, they can then be used to track the component through further assembly steps and as a storage device during the lifetime of the finished product, enabling a simultaneous way of protecting against product piracy and structural health monitoring. The correlation between the RFID signal and the resin state in the fiber layup is shown for several systems. The results show that RFID transponders can be used for both glass and carbon fiber parts to monitor the production process. This will allow a more efficient production of composite parts, shortening process duration and saving resources. The monitoring of the resin flow and cure in the fiber layers underneath an RFID transponder allows the manufacturer to gain information about the state of the process during production. Resin profiles in a thick fiber layup were successfully tracked using an RFID transponder placed above them. The monitoring of the resin in the fiber layers allows the manufacturer to gain information about the state of the process during production. Summarizing the results of our research, the use of RFID transponders as sensors allows an efficient and process friendly monitoring of the resin behavior during vacuum infusion, and the transponders can be further used in logistics. The tracking of the resin behavior beneath a sensor opens up possibilities for further optimization of the part quality.}

This problem is formulated to find an optimal condition for both receiving and shipping trucks sequences. Due to the difficulty of the practicality of the truck scheduling problem for large-scale cases, the literature has shown that there is a chance, even with low possibility, for a new optimizer to outperform existing algorithms for this optimization problem. Already applied successfully to solve similar complicated optimization problems, the Social Engineering Optimizer (SEO) inspired by social engineering phenomena, has been never applied to the truck scheduling problem. This motivates us to develop a set of novel modifications of the recently-developed SEO. To validate these optimizers, they are evaluated by solving a set of standard benchmark functions. All the algorithms have been calibrated by the Taguchi experimental design approach to further enhance their optimization performance. In addition to some benchmarks of truck scheduling, a real case study to prove the proposed problem is utilized to show the high-efficiency of the developed optimizers in a real situation. The results indicate that the proposed modifications of SEO considerably outperform the state of the art algorithms and provide very competitive results.}

Although extensive studies exist on the impact of international shipping at a global scale, few tools and empirical papers are available to assess the progress made so far in the shift towards carbon clean maritime supply chains. The paper identifies the key factors affecting CO2 emissions by container ships based on extant literature and business insights and measures how much has been already achieved in the past decade by offering multi-trade comparisons of the situations in 2007 and 2016. The paper concludes to a general decrease in annual CO2 emissions estimated at 33% since 2007. Two factors explain this decrease: first, the CO2 fuel efficiency in grams per TEU-km (−53%) due to the general decrease in speed and change in technology, and second, the decrease from changes in network design leading to less distance travelled (−21%). One factor counterbalances these positive effects, i.e. the increase in the total deployed fleet capacity, partly due to an increase in the number and average size of vessels (+81%). Finally, the paper discusses how these findings could be used by shippers and logistics service providers when designing cargo routing solutions in a supply chain setting based on their carbon efficiency.}

In this paper, we focus on operational ground handling planning and model it as an archetype of vehicle routing problems with multiple synchronization constraints, coined as “abstract vehicle routing problem with worker and vehicle synchronization” (AVRPWVS). The AVRPWVS deals with routing workers to ground handling jobs such as unloading baggage or refuelling an aircraft, while meeting each job’s time window. Moreover, each job can be performed by a variable number of workers. As airports span vast distances and due to security regulations, workers use vehicles to travel between locations. Furthermore, each vehicle, moved by a driver, can carry several workers. We propose two mathematical multi-commodity flow formulations based on time-space networks to efficiently model five synchronization types including movement and load synchronization. Moreover, we develop a branch-and-price heuristic that employs both conventional variable branching and a novel variable fixing strategy. We demonstrate that the procedure achieves results close to the optimal solution in short time when compared to the two integer models.}

Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) are a group of lysosomal storage disorders, leading to the progressive accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and the subsequent compromising of tissues and organ malfunction. Although incurable, most types of MPS can be treated with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), an approach that has had positive effects on the natural clinical evolution and which impact has been extensively investigated. Unfortunately, to date, there is relatively little data regarding the effects of ERT interruption, especially in Latin America, where such interruption may be frequent due to a variety of issues (for instance, difficulties involving logistics, reimbursement and/or payment withdrawal).
Method
A group of medical professionals from Latin America with experience in Genetics, Pediatrics and Neurology held an Advisory Board Meeting in the city of São Paulo, in October 2018, to discuss the issue of ERT interruptions in the region and recommendations to health care professionals on how to deal with these interruptions and better assess the therapeutic effects of ERT.
Conclusion
Recommendations provided by the experts may support physicians in dealing with the most common reasons for ERT interruptions in Latin America. Most importantly, recommendations for data collection at specific timepoints (at baseline, throughout the treatment and during the interruption period of ERT and after its resumption) can significantly improve the collection of real world evidence on the effects of ERT and its interruptions, supporting health care professionals and policy makers in the decision making regarding the provision of these therapies for MPS patients.}

abstract = {Supply chain risk analysis is an important field in operations management and logistics. Identifying those risks, assessing the probability of those risks, and understanding how those risks change if mitigation strategies are implemented contribute to better supply chain risk management. Reliability analysis has a long tradition of assessing the probability of failure, and fault trees are typically used to understand how the failure of individual components can lead to system failure within an engineered system. More recently, fault trees have been proposed to assess the probability of a supply chain failure. Dynamic fault trees, which are relatively new in reliability analysis, model the dependency among possible component failure and how these probabilities change over time. This paper applies dynamic fault trees to model supply chain risk for different types of supply chains. The dynamic fault tree allows a firm to model complex interactions among suppliers and understand how those interactions impact its risk. The model incorporates an information system that relays information about the status of suppliers to the firm, and this information system could also fail. A Markov chain model and Monte Carlo simulation are used to numerically assess supply chain risk as modeled by these dynamic fault trees.}

Of the 454 cases reported, cases that were of trauma/post-operative, undergone epidural block, lumbosacral level, paralysis-free, were excluded. 10 clinical items were identified as factors related to the outcome of therapy, and a total of 142 cases (73 surgical and 69 non-surgical/observation cases) which included all items in its record, were extracted for this study. 104 cases that made complete recovery from spinal paralysis (CR) includes 65 cases without surgical intervention (NOP-CR). Using “paralysis recovery start time (PRST)”, ROC analysis was conducted to show the diagnostic time needed to detect the cases of CR and NOP-CR. Clinical characteristics of CR and NOP-CR were identified using multiple logistics regression analysis. CR probability were higher at PRST < 15 h from the onset and NOP-CR was even higher at < 11 h. Three clinical items: incomplete motor paralysis, no use of anti-coagulant therapy, and PRST within 15 h were found to be the characteristics of CR and NOP-CR. The case with all 3 items; especially PRST within 11 h from onset, is applicable to non-operative observation. Immediate surgical intervention at 6-hours is recommended in cases that presented with unchanged complete motor paralysis. Observation treatment is discontinued and converted to surgery if motor usefulness is not regained at 15-hours.}

abstract = {In this study, we address an Inventory Routing Problem for hazardous and deteriorating pharmaceutical items in a healthcare network. Each hospital's demand is assumed to be deterministic but time varying over a finite planning horizon. Demand can be satisfied through a supply network, either from the main central pharmacy, or from other related hospitals' drugstores by allowing the transshipment option. The medicines deteriorate under a constant rate during the storage period. The proposed model is a bi-objective mixed integer mathematical programming. The first objective aims to minimize the total cost of logistics including ordering, transportation, delivery, pickup, shortage and inventory holding costs. The second objective function attempts to minimize the maximum accident loss during distribution among all periods. To consider the accident loss, for each route, two essential parameters are estimated based on historical data; the occurrence probability and severity index of accident. The model therefore attempts to utilize the best configuration of the routes and transshipment option to satisfy the demand while minimizing the costs and accident loss simultaneously. Several numerical examples are generated and solved by CPLEX and compared with the solutions of an efficient Hybrid Genetic Algorithm (HGA). The results show that the transshipment option not only can be used as a lever to increase the economic supply network performance through saving the routes, but also it can help the system to avoid risky routes.}

This paper aims to develop a unifying global network representation and strategic, system-wide decision model, the Strategic Cargo Routing Model, incorporating both liner and bulk shipping markets to estimate real-world traffic flows and study traffic patterns at the global scale. Specifically, taking a shipper's perspective, containerized and bulk movements are jointly modelled within a mixed-integer linear program that includes inbound, outbound, and transshipment cargo flows at ports. An iterative approach that combines heuristic Gradient Descent and Relax-and-Fix Decomposition methods is proposed for the calibration and solution of the Strategic Cargo Routing Model over a proposed joint liner and bulk services Global Cargo Shipping Network representation. The Global Cargo Shipping Network contains 161 seaports covering 52 countries. It is created from updatable, publicly available, data sources, and all data needed for the network representation are made available. Sufficient network details, as well as data sources and methods for extracting needed inputs, are given to allow others to use and update the network. Using the developed maritime network, mathematical model and calibration-solution methodology, 2018 global maritime traffic flow patterns were estimated. The estimates were found to achieve a 91% fit overall to real-world average annual port throughputs. This strategic model provides support to evaluate future, real-world, worldwide changes, such as increased seaborne trade demand, new routes, shipping infrastructure expansion, and transport policies.}

Due to the role of resource utilization as a key component of logistics network design, another primary goal of design is ensuring available scarce resources are used as efficiently as possible across all facilities. To address efficiency issues in a sustainable closed-loop supply chain network, a stochastic integrated multi-objective mixed integer nonlinear programming model is developed in this paper, in which sustainability outcomes as well as efficiency of facility resource utilization are considered in the design of a sustainable supply chain network. In doing so, efficiency is assessed using a bi-objective output-oriented data envelopment analysis model. A hybrid three-step solution methodology is presented that creates a linear form of the original mixed integer nonlinear programming problem using piecewise McCormick envelopes approach. In the second step, an aggregated single objective programming model is derived by exploiting the multi-choice goal programming. Finally, a Lagrangian relaxation algorithm is developed to effectively solve the latter stochastic single objective mixed integer linear programming problem. The application of the proposed approach is investigated with data drawn from a case study in the electronics industry. This case study illustrates how firms may balance sustainability and efficiency in the supply chain network design problem. Further, it demonstrates the integration of efficiency results in improving economic aspects of sustainability as well as social responsibility outcomes, but also highlights the trade-offs that exist between efficiency and environmental impacts.}

This assumption necessitates that manufacturing and remanufacturing processes are static in all cycles, i.e. it ignores the impact of the first cycle. This implies that the result of such modelling may not be an optimal policy. Another implicit assumption embedded in the classical formulation is that input parameters remain static indefinitely. In practice, however, it is often desirable that input parameters are adjusted to be responsive to a new policy due to acquired new knowledge. This paper develops a general joint model for production of new items together with remanufacturing of returned items “as good as new” condition. The proposed model focuses on a single production cycle and a single remanufacturing cycle and, as part of its formulation, considers the first time interval. This implies that the decision variables should vary from cycle to cycle until the system plateaus. Adopting this approach ensures a more realistic tractability of the impact of previous cycles, including the first time cycle. The mathematical formulation considers arbitrary functions of time, which allows the decision maker to assess and compare the consequences of a diverse range of time-varying forms by employing a single inventory model. All functions and input parameters may change their values for subsequent cycles and/or periodic review or remain static. A rigorous method is utilised to show that the solution, if it exists, is unique and global optimal. The paper provides illustrative examples that demonstrate the application of the theoretical model in different settings.}

In FCMs, system variables (concepts) and degree of interrelationships are quantified by means of fuzzy sets. However, these fuzzy sets are defuzzified and fuzzy singletons are processed in the inference algorithm. Defuzzification of fuzzy numbers before the FCM inference implies information loss which is an undesired situation. Moreover, the resultant concept values are fuzzy singletons that these crisp numbers do not provide any information about the range of possible outcomes. There is a research gap in the literature regarding fuzzy number representation in FCMs that the both of the inputs and outputs of FCMs being fuzzy sets. This study proposes alpha-cut based computational procedures for simulating FCMs in which concepts and degree of relationships are represented via fuzzy numbers. The proposed model is tested on well-known problems adopted from the literature by using type-1 fuzzy numbers and the results are compared with the extension principle-based approach. Moreover, the proposed model is extended to interval type-2 (IT2) fuzzy sets and computational details regarding IT2 FCMs are given. Because relative importance of criteria is usually modeled via fuzzy sets in multiple-attribute decision making problems, a new FCM-based objective weighting method is proposed in order to demonstrate the usefulness of fuzzy number representation in FCMs. The proposed model is implemented in the real-life third-party logistics service provider selection problem.}

abstract = {This paper presents an analysis of the potential impacts of large-scale adoption of driverless trucks on transport patterns and system costs for a national freight transport system with Sweden as a case study. The analysis is performed by extending the application domain of the Swedish national freight transport model Samgods to analyze two types of driverless truck scenarios. The first scenario represents a full adoption of driverless trucks that can operate the complete road network and thereby substitute manually driven trucks. In this scenario, road transport tonne-kilometers on Swedish territory increase by 22%, vehicle kilometers traveled by trucks increase by 35% and annual total system costs decrease by 1.7 B€ compared to a baseline scenario without driverless trucks. In the second scenario, the current fleet of manually driven trucks is complemented by driverless trucks that can operate on major roads between logistics hubs, but not in complex traffic environments like urban areas due to a limited operational design domain. This may be an initial use-case for driverless trucks operating on public roads. In this scenario, road tonne-kilometers increase by 11%, truck vehicle kilometers traveled increase by 15%, and annual total system costs decrease by 1.2 B€ compared to the baseline. For both scenarios, the impacts of driverless trucks vary significantly between commodity types and transport distances which suggests heterogeneity of benefits of automated driving between different types of freight flows. A sensitivity analysis is performed in which the costs for driverless truck operations is varied, and for the second scenario, also which parts of the road network that driverless trucks can operate are varied. This analysis indicates that the magnitude of impacts is highly dependent on the cost level of driverless trucks and that the ability for DL-trucks to perform international, cross-border transport is crucial for achieving reductions in system costs. An overarching conclusion of the study is that driverless trucks may lead to a significant increase in road transport demand due to modal shifts from rail and sea as a result of the improved cost performance of road transport. This would further strengthen the need to decarbonize road transport to meet non-negotiable climate targets. Important topics for future research include assessing potential societal costs related to driverless trucks due to infrastructure investments and negative externalities such as increasing CO2 emissions and congestion.}

Using a case study in the electronics manufacturing industry, we identify and analyze barriers in terms of their impact along the value chain (VC) as well as the level of difficulty required to overcome them. This allows us to map barriers to managerial responsibilities, thus improving the organizational transition process. The key findings of this research are: (1) To scale up CEBM on the firm-level, additional changes need to be implemented next to the oft-cited and discussed changes towards a Product-Service-System (PSS) and reverse logistics. Based on literature research and our case study, we put forward an extensive list of 29 potential barriers. (2) As managerial and financial resources are limited, we also suggest a priority ranking for barriers. Specifically, we show that barriers should be prioritized along the dimensions of their organizational resistivity and their impact on the VC. Organizational resistivity refers to the estimated effort along managerial time, financial resources, and cultural resistance for change, while VC impact refers to the ability of the barrier to influence and re-direct product, parts, and material flows along the foreword and reverse supply chain. This type of barrier assessment is new to the literature. (3) We argue that the proposed method for barrier prioritization, which we term the Circular Economy Matrix, can be readily transferred to manufacturing firms in other industries. (4) Clustering the barriers along managerial responsibilities (sets of barriers) is shown to lead to a more efficient and effective transition, as gauged by incurred transaction costs.}

The proposed model tries to maximize profit primarily while capturing societal community development by prioritizing the less developed regions. Moreover, the model ensures that the environmentally friendly facilities can operate in the supply chain network while others have to be repaired. Furthermore, quantifying the benefits of transportation decisions in terms of both cost and environmental impact savings to improve the sustainability of logistics systems is considered. In addition, the model is regarded as robust programming for the problem to approximate real situations. The proposed model is implemented in some numerical examples and in a real case study. Numerical results and computational analysis are indicative of the significance of the model and through conducting the case study, it is demonstrated that the proposed model can be implemented successfully in practice and it would be beneficial to all the three pillars of sustainable development. Moreover, the managerial insights for the managers of the supply chain networks are provided to make the most appropriate decisions.}

Preoperative anemia is an important pillar of perioperative patient blood management. However, there was no literature comprehensively described the current situation of preoperative anemia in China.
Methods
We conducted a national retrospective cross-sectional study to assess the prevalence and intervention of preoperative anemia in Chinese adults. Data were from the National Preoperative Anemia Database based on hospital administration data from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2018.
Findings
A total of 797,002 patients were included for analysis. Overall, 27.57% (95% CI 27.47–27.67) of patients had preoperative anemia, which varied by gender, age, regions, and type of operation. Patients who were female, age over 60 years old, from South China, from provinces with lower per capita GDP, underwent operations on the lymphatic and hematopoietic system, with laboratory abnormalities were more likely to have a high risk of preoperative anemia. Among patients with preoperative anemia, 5.16% (95% CI 5.07–5.26) received red blood cell transfusion, 7.79% (95% CI 7.67–7.91) received anemia-related medications such as iron, erythropoietin, folic acid or vitamin B12, and 12.25% (95% CI 12.10–12.40) received anemia-related therapy (red blood cell transfusion or anemia-related medications) before operation. The probability of preoperative RBC transfusion decreased by 54.92% (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.46–0.47) as each 10-g/L increase in preoperative hemoglobin. Patients with preoperative hemoglobin less than 130 g/L was associated with longer hospital stay and more hospital costs. Patients with severe preoperative anemia given iron preoperatively had lower intra/post-operative RBC transfusion rate, shorter length of stay and less hospitalization costs, but no similar correlation was found in patients with mild and moderate preoperative anemia and patients given erythropoietin preoperatively.
Interpretation
Our present study shows that preoperative anemia is currently a relatively prevalent problem that has not been fully appreciated in China. More researches will be required to optimize the treatment of preoperative anemia.

However, the actual performances of these consolidants have always left doubts, mostly as regards to their long-term – and, in some situations, short-term – behaviour when used for outdoor objects. The encouraging results that have been reported for the biomineralisation process in limestones, both for laboratory conditions and in trial tests, led to test it under onsite conditions to assess the operational aspects, as well as on a conservation intervention carried out for a limestone portal in the south of Portugal. The biotechnology approach reported here resorts to the activation of carbonatogenic bacteria present in the substrate’s microbiota. In this paper, the main steps and logistics requirements for this consolidation treatment - environmental control, product transport and application conditions – are summarised, onsite test results are presented and discussed, and its application in a conservation intervention is described and commented. The onset of this new consolidation treatment led us to revisit past experiences on Portuguese heritage objects as an opportunity to discuss the practical significance and applicability of the concepts of effectiveness and compatibility in the consolidation of soft calcareous stone materials. A new conceptual and practical approach to deal with the very complex and difficult problem posed by the consolidation of real outdoor exposed and decayed objects is proposed. The discussion is based on the authors’ experience on four Portuguese monuments: the Santa Cruz church (Coimbra), the Porta Especiosa of the Old Cathedral of Coimbra, the National Palace of Queluz, and the Main Portal of the Loulé church. The potential of the method and its encouraging results may represent the crossing of a new technological and practical frontier to consolidate decayed highly porous limestones.}

However, current business practices are limited to reuse or shredding of HDDs for base metal recovery, which are not optimal for environmental sustainability. In particular, the neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnets, which contain rare earth elements (REEs) that have significant environmental impacts and supply chain risks, are not recovered. To address this challenge, technologies are emerging to enable REE recovery from HDDs. This work focuses on comparing novel technologies, including direct reuse of magnet assemblies, magnet-to-magnet recycling, and recovery of REEs. Life cycle assessment (LCA) was performed on each recovery pathway to quantify and compare the environmental impacts. Primary data were collected from Seagate and other key stakeholders in the HDD value chain. LCA results showed that reusing HDDs is the most environmentally friendly option in terms of global warming potential, reducing CO2 eq. emissions by 5∼18 kg per drive life cycle, when compared to the virgin production and shredding for aluminum recovery. Reuse of magnet assembly is the next best option (reducing ∼1.9 kg of CO2 eq. emissions), followed by magnet-to-magnet recycling (∼1.2 kg of CO2 eq. emissions), and metal recycling (∼0.02 kg of CO2 eq. emissions). Environmental hotspots were also identified, revealing the significant contribution of intercontinental transportation mode for the reverse logistics. Future research is suggested on optimizing the reverse supply chain to reduce the environmental footprint of HDD value recovery.}

In RFID systems, a tag usually stores private or sensitive information, and so it needs an access control mechanism. When a tag's owner is changed, the read permission of the tag needs to be transferred from the old owner to the new owner, and this is when ownership transfer schemes come into play. In fact, not only do RFID ownership transfer schemes do ownership transfer, but they have to make sure that the ownership transfer procedure is executed under proper security protection. Besides, in some particular environments, the ownership transfer would be far more efficiently done if the tags could be treated as a group instead of individual tags. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel group ownership transfer protocol that satisfies all important security requirements including mutual authentication, data and location privacy, forward/backward secrecy, ownership privacy, and group ownership integrity. In addition, due to the use of cloud computing, our new protocol provides ubiquitous authentication. Based on homomorphic encryption and quadratic residues, our novel RFID group ownership transfer protocol can have encrypted data efficiently processed, and the communication cost is very low. The results of our BAN logic correctness check, security analysis, and performance evaluation confirm that the new protocol is logically correct and is capable of providing high level security/privacy protection on the basis of high cost-effective performance.}

The paper also discusses key challenges that restrict the compliance of the policies to the Strategy, identifies policy gaps and provides recommendations for future policy formation. A structured review was conducted of over ninety policies relevant to the biomass, bioprocessing and biobased products. The value chain approach was used as a tool to harmonise these sectors under a common bioeconomy framework and provides an understanding of how key activities and challenges are being addressed. Several gaps were identified in relation to these challenges in each stage, at land use stage a lack of European-wide harmonised characterisation of marginal land and integration among sectoral policies targeting soil quality and financial measures incentivising the uptake of sustainable soil improvers. At the biomass production stage, inadequate policy support was found for waste mobilisation and valorisation. Furthermore, there is a lack of policy provisions and financial support improving collaborations among value chain actors to overcome the complexity associated with harmonising biomass logistics and conversion processes. Finally, regarding the end use stage, policy interventions targeting the distribution and standardisation of the wide, available range of biobased products and services remain limited. Based on this gap analysis, a set of recommendations was produced outlining ways in which policy measures can be updated through introducing either financial, regulatory or information provisions, or formulating novel policies altogether. These recommendations were made following the value chain analysis approach, which addresses specific challenges in relation to the five core objectives of the Bioeconomy Strategy, with the aim of further increasing the level of coherence among sectoral policies.}

However, abandoned bicycles have caused a waste of resources and environmental damage. Additionally, the negative effects will exceed the positive impact that sharing bicycle creates if these abandoned bicycles are handled improperly. This paper proposes a two-stage method to study the recycling of abandoned bicycles, including the selection of the third-party logistics suppliers (3 PLs) and the recycling network design. In the first stage, interval type-2 fuzzy sets (IT2FSs) and Vlse Kriterjumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) are used to select the 3 PLs. The dynamic time series, individual regrets, and group efficiency are all taken into account. In the second stage, From the perspective of maximizing overall benefits, a mathematical model considering the purchase cost of raw materials, transportation costs, recovery costs, and environmental benefits is established to design a recycling network. Finally, the applicability of the proposed method is numerically demonstrated by solving a real case, and key conclusions are that the recycling mode with the participation of the 3 PLs in sharing bicycle system is the most reasonable and feasible. However, in this mode, the selection criteria of the 3 PLs are different from other industries, which need to be given enough attention by the sharing bicycle operators. Additionally, in the recycling network design, considering the maximum overall interests of the three parties, the factory, the 3 PLs, and the operators, must coincide with the social philosophy of sustainable development. The results are of great guiding significance to the recycling of sharing bicycles.}

In recent years, these delivery costs have increased as a result of changes in fuel costs, which has brought new challenges to retailers in terms of offering competitive prices. Many retailers have begun to utilize a drone-based aerial delivery system as an alternative solution to overcome the problems related to the high transportation costs and traffic jams in large cities. This study provides a mathematical model for minimizing the total costs of the aerial delivery system concerned with refuel stations, warehouses, drone procurement, and transportation. The waiting time of the customers is restricted based on the M/G/K queueing system. The fuel stations and warehouses are the main components of the network. The demand (occurring at the lowest level) is ultimately satisfied via launch stations (the network's highest level). Refuel stations support drones along their long routes between the launch stations and demand points. To account for the different levels of the facilities, a multi-level facility location approach is utilized. Moreover, the nondeterministic nature of the problem is tackled using fuzzy variables. The ultimate mathematical model is a congested fuzzy capacitated multi-level facility location problem that is solved by the possibilistic approach.}

Explore current maternal and infant nutrition education practices and family medicine primary care providers' views on a group care model to deliver nutrition education to mother–infant dyads.
Design
In-depth interviews.
Setting
Family medicine clinics in 1 Midwestern US hospital system.
Participants
Family medicine primary care providers (n = 17) who regularly see infants during well-baby visits.
Phenomenon of Interest
Current maternal and infant nutrition education practices; views on ideal way to deliver nutrition education to mother–infant dyads; feedback on group care model to deliver nutrition education to mother–infant dyads.
Analysis
Audio recordings transcribed verbatim and coded using conventional content analysis.
Results
Family medicine primary care providers are limited in the ability to provide maternal and infant nutrition education and desire a different approach. Group care was the preferred method; it was shared most frequently as the ideal approach to nutrition education delivery and participants reacted favorably when presented with this model. However, there were many concerns with group care (eg, moderating difficult conversations, program implementation logistics, sufficient group volume, and interruption in patient–provider relationship).
Conclusion and Implications
Family medicine primary care providers desire a different approach to deliver nutrition education to mother–infant dyads in clinic. A group care model may be well-accepted among family medicine primary care providers but issues must be resolved before implementation. These results could inform future group care implementation studies and influence provider buy-in.}

With technological improvements, inputs, such as the first-generation feedstock (i.e., corn and sugarcane) have been the primary sources for bioethanol production. Nevertheless, their seasonal availability, competition with food/feed, and the fluctuating prices play significant roles in commercial bioethanol industries. In consequence, waste-based biofuels, such as lignocelluloses and algal biomass, which have the potential to fight aforesaid bottlenecks are targeted for cost-effective bioethanol production. Although these biomasses offer encouraging economic potential through varied value chains and low feedstock costs, relatively immature technologies, demanding logistics for sourcing, and wavering investors pose barricades in their utilization potential. Fostering the use of feedstock requires setting ambitious targets for the use of biofuels in transport for cost-competitive waste-based ethanol production and stringent policy supports. In recent year, the life cycle analysis methodology has been implied to assess the potential economic benefits as well as ecological and possible environmental impacts owing to biobased ethanol industries.}

Although freight transport systems are driven by private sector initiatives, the role of the public sector is crucial in developing the proper regulatory framework, addressing social issues, and providing the necessary transportation infrastructure. This role is even more important in emerging market cities, in which urbanization is increasing very rapidly, posing significant opportunities and major challenges to policymakers and companies alike. Emerging market cities exhibit a changing environment in terms of structure and needs of industries requiring goods movement activity, consumption pattern fluctuations due to transformations in population and economy, and logistics processes and supply chains associated with the evolution in international trade. The existence of a port within the region is a critical factor for increasing economic prosperity and development potential but adds to the overall complexity and contributes to negative impacts from port-related activities. Port cities have peculiarities in regard to freight movements and face the challenge of balancing the demand for additional space for different activities (i.e., operational, industrial, touristic, etc). Constructive dialog among key stakeholders with the aim of determining priorities and objectives in freight movement planning could provide a solid basis to overcome the difficulties derived from the interaction of port activities and urban growth. The focus of this chapter is on how stakeholder consultation may support freight planning with the aim of achieving sustainable development in emerging market port cities. The policy challenges, previous experience, and the mix of commonly acceptable plans from different stakeholders are presented for supporting decision-making of public sector and industry.}

A two-phase approach, called clustering first, packing-routing second, is proposed for use during the first stage. The clustering of backhauls is carried out using the k-means algorithm. A hybrid approach is provided, which combines the packing of orders by first solving a 3D loading problem for each cluster using machine learning with a best-fit-first strategy, with routing using a genetic algorithm. During the second stage, the train-loading problem is solved using a mixed integer programming approach to minimise the total costs by incorporating various cost types, in which detention and demurrage costs are taken into account. All solution approaches are computationally evaluated on real-world data provided by an international logistics firm and new randomly generated instances. Comparisons are carried out using both exact solution methods and heuristic approaches, and the proposed approach was shown to be more effective for real-world problems.}

Everyday, several vehicles, usually internal combustion engine vehicles, have to serve a high number of customers spatially distributed in an urban area. Their presence generates several negative externalities, such as, noise, congestion and pollutant emissions. Drones have become a valid alternative to support the delivery process and several big companies, such as, Amazon and DHL, have started to use them for parcels deliveries. On the one hand, drones drastically reduce negative externalities, allowing a more sustainable delivery process. On the other hand, several technical aspects must be carefully taken into account. In particular, they have a limited flight endurance and capacity. In addition, several restrictions related to safety and flight area must be considered. Indeed, not all countries allow the use of drones in the urban area. In this work, we provide a qualitative and quantitative analysis on benefits and drawbacks in using drones in the parcels delivery process. We analyze three different transportation systems with incremental use of drones for the delivery. In particular, we address the problem of delivering parcels without drone, known as vehicle routing problem, the problem in which the deliveries are performed by a fleet of drones starting from the central depot, and a hybrid transportation system where the classical vehicles are equipped with drones. In the latter case, the classical vehicles perform the deliveries and the drones can get in charge some deliveries. The drone takes off from the vehicle, carries out the delivery, and lands to the same vehicle at a randevouz-location. During the drone delivery, the classical vehicle continues its work. The three transportation systems are formalized via mathematical programming models. The solutions obtained by solving the models via a general-purpose solver are compared and insights on the use of drones in the urban area are provided.}

The newest agricultural frontier in Brazil is the Matopiba region, which is a continuous zone formed by the states of Maranhão, Tocantins, Piauí, and Bahia, located mostly within the Cerrado biome. The objective of this study was to analyze the spatiotemporal dynamics of soybean production and yield in the Matopiba region. We analyzed municipality-based planted areas and production data obtained by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics during 1990–2015. Yield was estimated from the production and planted area, and the data were analyzed using global and local Moran indices. The results showed that soybean production in the Matopiba region does not occur randomly. Positive and significant autocorrelation was found at the beginning of the time series among those municipalities located in the west of Bahia. This region influenced the soybean expansion from south to north. Currently, high-production areas are concentrated in two autocorrelated blocks: one in western Bahia and the other in the central Matopiba region. Analysis of spatial autocorrelation involving yield showed a decreasing trend at the end of the time series. The presence of municipalities with high yield surrounded by others with low yield, and vice-versa, were observed. The findings of this study could assist local and regional agricultural planning in the Matopiba region, and support related analyses in other fields of agriculture, the environment, and logistics.}

Within the biorefinery paradigm, where renewable resources are converted into a range of high, medium and low value products, in an analogous manner to fossil fuels in a petrochemical refinery, SCG have been established as an amenable lignocellulosic feedstock through numerous research efforts. In this critical review, we give an extensive overview for the first time of the primary and secondary product suites that can be generated from SCG, along with their potential applications. The handful of preliminary technoeconomic and lifecycle assessment of using SCG for bioenergy is discussed, highlighting the economic limitations of a single capability, phase one biorefinery operating under the current scale and logistics of SCG collection. A concluding perspective towards future SCG-based biorefineries is presented, where isolation and production of higher value bioactive products is expected to be integral to the economic feasibility of the process.}

The focus of this study is on additive manufacturing (also known as 3D printing), which was the dominant manufacturing method employed in these production efforts. Production details from a variety of informal production efforts were systematically analyzed to quantify the scale and efficiency of different efforts. Data for this analysis was primarily drawn from detailed survey data from 74 individuals who participated in these different production efforts, as well as from a systematic review of 145 publicly available news stories. This rich dataset enables a comprehensive summary of the community-driven production efforts, with detailed and quantitative comparisons of different efforts. In this study, factors that influenced production efficiency and success were investigated, including choice of PPE designs, production logistics, and additive manufacturing processes employed by makerspaces and universities. From this investigation, several themes emerged including challenges associated with matching production rates to demand, production methods with vastly different production rates, inefficient production due to slow build times and high scrap rates, and difficulty obtaining necessary feedstocks. Despite these challenges, nearly every maker involved in these production efforts categorized their response as successful. Lessons learned and themes derived from this systematic study of these results are compiled and presented to help inform better practices for future community-driven use of additive manufacturing, especially in response to emergencies.}

A simulated plume of strong radiation was generated from the explosion site, contaminating the surrounding area. Several atmospheric conditions impact on the contamination. However, this study focusses on the following main variables considered by HotSpot for a conservative simulation: (a) the atmospheric stability conditions (Pasquill-Gifford - PG classes); (b) the explosive power, and (c) the source-term. Gaussian modeling was used for its speed, and for its capacity to estimate the time-integrated atmospheric concentration of an aerosol at any point in 3D space. The simulation provided information about four main outcomes: (a) contamination plume area; (b) radiological risk dependency on PG classes; (c) total effective dose equivalent (TEDE) with a possible dependence on receptor height; and (d) potentially affected population's size. The findings suggest that a protocolled response from authorities should be implemented in order to effectively follow possible changes in the PG class. Which, in turn, may negatively impact the decision-making process.}

Using sedaDNA, palaeo-communities have been detected, including prokaryotes and eukaryotes that do not fossilise, thereby revolutionising the scope of marine micropalaeontological research. However, many studies to date have not reported on the measures taken to prove the authenticity of sedaDNA-derived data from which conclusions are drawn. aDNA is highly fragmented and degraded and extremely sensitive to contamination by non-target environmental DNA. Contamination risks are particularly high on research vessels, drilling ships and platforms, where logistics and facilities do not yet allow for sterile sediment coring, and due consideration needs to be given to sample processing and analysis following aDNA guidelines. This review clarifies the use of aDNA terminology, discusses common pitfalls and highlights the urgency behind adopting new standards for marine sedaDNA research, with a focus on sampling optimisation to facilitate the incorporation of routine sedaDNA research into International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) operations. Currently available installations aboard drilling ships and platforms are reviewed, improvements suggested, analytical approaches detailed, and the controls and documentation necessary to support the authenticity of aDNA retrieved from deep-sea sediment cores is outlined. Beyond practical considerations, concepts relevant to the study of past marine biodiversity based on sedaDNA, and the applicability of the new guidelines to the study of other contamination-susceptible environments (permafrost and outer space) are discussed.}

abstract = {Background
Australia’s increasing organ donor rate has translated to increased lung donor referrals and subsequent lung transplantation (LTx). The LTx sector attempts to utilise as many organs as possible—but in reality, not all are used. This analysis aims to assess the utility and efficiency of donor lung referrals to the Alfred Hospital.
Methods
All Donatelife Australia donor lung referrals for the year 2017 were analysed retrospectively.
Results
From a total of 440 lung referrals, 220 were local from the state of Victoria (population 6.4 million) and 220 from the Rest-of-Australia (ROA). Sixty-eight per cent (68%) of Victorian and 48% of the ROA were via the donation after circulatory death (DCD) pathway. One hundred and two (102) LTx were performed: 32 represent 21% of 149 Victorian and 8% of 106 ROA DCD donors, 70 represent 54% of the Victorian and 24% of the ROA donation after brain death (DBD) donors. Eighty per cent (80%) of all donors aged <35 and 30% >35 years were used or potentially useable. Thirteen per cent (13%) of DCD and 44% of DBD donors aged >65 years were used. Logistical and resource considerations, around the retrieval of older DCD lungs, are a significant issue. At 11.1 LTx per-million-population the Alfred has one of the highest lung donor conversion and LTx activity rates in the world.
Conclusion
The Australian donor lung pool could still be further extended by focussing effort and logistics on optimising DBD referrals. Additional resources (staff and transport), tighter referral criteria, and the use of extended warm ischaemic time donors could increase particularly DCD recovery rates.}

abstract = {Purpose
Cardiac transplantation is still underperformed in India. There is a glaring disproportion between the patients who suffer from heart transplant and those who get it done. The post-transplant rehabilitation also is dependent on the socioeconomic status of patients. The healthcare system in India is not yet fully dependent on the government and most transplants happen in private hospitals with minimal support from the state. This study investigates these socioeconomic aspects of transplant from a Centre that performs the largest number of transplants in the state of Kerala which ranks highest in healthcare in India.
Methods
All heart transplants that happened since 2013 at our centre were investigated by looking into records and follow up charts. Special emphasis was given to the social and economic aspects pre- and post-transplant. The preoperative workup, immunosuppression and surgical procedures were identical for all patients.
Results
25 transplants were performed in this period. There were 3 perioperative deaths due to primary graft dysfunction. There was one sudden cardiac death six months from transplant. There were 2 suicides of which one was directly related to the financial crisis following losing job after transplant. There were 3 deaths related to graft rejection. Two recipients who worked in corporate offices could continue their job. Two patients were supported by local Church and friends and obtained a job with decent living. Majority of patients were supported by friends, relatives and local government bodies by raising funds which saw them through the expenses of transplant and initial rehabilitation.
Conclusion
The logistics involved in cardiac transplantation are more than other organs and there is an emotional component to it. Developing countries find it difficult to sustain a viable transplant program under the government sector. Private hospitals fill in this void but the economic implications are not well taken care of. Government needs to invest more in this and make it affordable to the socially and economically deprived who often are more susceptible to end stage heart failure.}

abstract = {Objective
To examine whether the Wijma Delivery Expectation Questionnaire (W-DEQ-A) and the one-item Fear of Childbirth-Postpartum-Visual Analogue Scale (FOCP-VAS) - measuring high FOC - are useful tools in predicting requested and received non-urgent obstetric interventions in pregnant women.
Design
A prospective cohort study.
Population and setting
Self-selected pregnant women from midwifery care settings (n=401).
Methods
W-DEQ-A and FOCP-VAS were assessed at two timepoints in pregnancy. Measures of non-urgent obstetric interventions which were derived from medical files were: induction of labour, epidural analgesia, augmentation with oxytocin due to failure to progress and self-requested caesarean section. Hierarchical logistics regression models were used.
Main outcome measures
The change in the Nagelkerke R2 was examined for three models predicting two outcome measures: (1) explicitly requested non-urgent obstetric interventions during pregnancy and (2) received non-urgent obstetric interventions during labour. The first model only included participants’ characteristics, the second model also included FOCP-VAS ≥5, and in the third model the W-DEQ-A ≥66 was added.
Results
High FOC measured with FOCP-VAS≥5 predicted requested (pseudo-R2=0.33, X2=59.82, P<0.001) and received non-urgent obstetric interventions (pseudo-R2=0.19, X2=32.81, P<0.001) better than high FOC measured with W-DEQ-A≥66.
Conclusion
This study is the first evaluating self-reported FOC and postpartum based on VAS (subjective outcome) in relation to actual pregnancy and childbirth outcomes derived from medical files (objective outcome). Non-urgent obstetric interventions could already be predicted in the first half of pregnancy by means of a simple FOC assessment with the one-item FOCP-VAS. Implementing this easy to use one-item screening tool in midwifery care is suggested.}

This study investigates the main causal and intermediate events that led to risk propagation in, and disruption of, the U.S. pharmaceutical supply chain following Hurricane Maria. A causality Bayesian model is developed to depict linkages between risk events and quantify the associated cumulative risk. The quantification is further examined through different advanced techniques such as predictive inference reasoning and sensitivity analysis. The general interpretation of these analyses suggests that port resilience is imperative to pharmaceutical supply chain performance in the case of Puerto Rico.}

abstract = {Introduction
All three evidence-based treatment options for adults with severe obesity – behavioral weight management, weight management medications (WMM), and bariatric surgery – are underutilized in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) system. Our objective in this study was to develop and pilot-test the TOTAL (Teaching Obesity Treatment Options to Adult Learners) intervention, which seeks to increase Veteran participation in obesity treatment.
Methods
In this single-site, parallel, pilot RCT, Veterans with severe obesity with an upcoming behavioral weight management visit were sent a recruitment letter after meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria via electronic health record screening. Eligible Veterans were randomized to TOTAL or usual care. TOTAL consisted of an 18-min video highlighting obesity health risks and treatment outcomes, eligibility criteria, and pros/cons of all three evidence-based obesity treatments. The primary outcomes were trial design feasibility (recruitment and retention rates) and acceptability to Veterans, which was assessed via semi-structured interviews with participants one week after randomization to TOTAL. Secondary outcomes included attitudes and self-efficacy to initiate treatment one week post-randomization and BMI change six months post-randomization (assessed via Cohen's d).
Results
Forty-two Veterans were randomized (recruitment rate = 47.2%), and 40/42 completed one-week assessments (retention rate = 95.2%). The mean participant age was 59.2 ± 11.9 years. Female and non-White participants comprised 14.3% and 11.9% of the cohort, respectively. Semi-structured interviews with all 20 participants who received TOTAL suggested that the delivery logistics and content of TOTAL were acceptable to Veterans. Attitudes toward behavioral weight management and bariatric surgery and weight loss improved in TOTAL vs. usual care patients (Cohen's d ranging from 0.3 to 0.6).
Conclusions
TOTAL was feasible to implement, acceptable to Veterans, and has the potential to increase obesity treatment participation in VHA. An adequately powered RCT is warranted to assess its impact on population-level weight loss.

This paper aims at VRPTW with the objectives of reducing the number of vehicles and minimizing the time-wasting during the delivery process caused by early arrival. To solve this NP-hard problem, a hybrid multiobjective evolutionary algorithm with fast sampling strategy-based global search and route sequence difference-based local search (HMOEA-GL) is proposed. Firstly, fast sampling strategy-based global search (FSS-GS) of HMOEA-GL extensively explores the entire solution space to quickly guide the search direction towards the center and edge areas of Pareto frontier. Secondly, route sequence difference-based local search (RSD-LS) is executed on the individuals with poor performance in the population obtained by FSS-GS to enhance the search ability of HMOEA-GL. In addition, the suitable coding method and proper genetic operators are designed, especially, a simple insertion search is used to reduce the number of vehicles in VRPTW. Comparing with NSGA-II, SPEA2, and MOEA/D, experimental results on 12 Solomon benchmark test problems indicate that the proposed HMOEA-GL is effective, and more excellent in convergence, while maintaining a satisfying distribution performance. HMOEA-GL could be an effective intelligent algorithm for expert and intelligent decision support system to help logistics companies to make decisions.}

Good animal welfare promotes the healthy growth of poultry, which can reduce the disease rate and improve the production quality and capacity. As behaviour responses are an important expression of welfare, the study of behaviour is a simple and non-invasive method to assess animal welfare. The use of modern technology offers the possibility to monitor the behaviour of broilers and laying hens in a continuous and automated way. This paper reviews the latest technologies used for monitoring the behaviour of broilers and laying hens under both experimental conditions and commercial applications and discusses the potential of developing a precision livestock farming (PLF) system. The techniques that are presented and discussed include sound analysis, which can be an online tool to automatically monitor poultry behaviour non-invasively at the group level; wireless, wearable sensors with radio-frequency identification devices, which can automatically identify individual chickens, track the location and movement of individuals in real time and quantify some behavioural traits accordingly and image processing technology, which can be considered a direct tool for measuring behaviours, especially activity behaviours and disease early warning. All of these technologies can monitor and analyse poultry behaviour, at the group level or individual level, on commercial farms. However, the popularity and adoption of these technologies has been hampered by the logistics of applying them to thousands and tens of thousands of birds on commercial farms. This review discusses the advantages and disadvantages of these techniques in commercial applications and presents evidence that they provide potential tools to automatically monitor the behaviours of broilers and laying hens on commercial farms. However, there still has a long way to go to develop a PLF system to detect and predict abnormal situations.}

abstract = {Background
Evidence of a gender wage gap has been identified across many professions, with some evidence in pharmacy. Negotiation is one potential strategy to address this gap and it is underutilized, especially among women. No studies to date have examined pharmacy student perceptions of negotiation when applying for co-operative education positions – a potential sign of willingness to negotiate for entry-level positions upon graduation.
Objectives
To examine pharmacy students' comfort with and ability to engage employers in negotiation over wage and other work-related considerations for mandatory and paid co-operative education work terms at the University of Waterloo (Waterloo, Ontario, Canada).
Methods
Two focus groups, one for female and one for male students, were performed with students who had completed at least one co-operative education placement. Focus groups aimed to elucidate students perceived ability to negotiate with potential employers, to identify strategies that educators can employ to better support students through the hiring and negotiation process, and to elicit student perceptions on the gender wage gap in pharmacy. Focus groups were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim, and data were coded inductively by two independent reviewers, employing thematic analysis.
Results
Three major and two minor themes were identified: Preservation of the relationship; Power differential and perceived ability to negotiate; Institutional support and training; Negative experience with negotiation and wage gaps; and the presence of a gendered approach to negotiation. Pharmacy students rarely engage in negotiation during co-operative hiring processes at the University of Waterloo, with some female students expressing hesitation to negotiate due to concerns about being perceived as “bossy”. Students of both genders felt poorly equipped to engage in negotiation with a potential employer, and lacked confidence in initiating such a conversation.
Conclusions
Students identified a number of factors which influence their ability and desire to negotiate wages during co-op placement, including the requirements and logistics of placements, the perceived power imbalance between students and potential employers, and a concern that any wage negotiation may overshadow the value placed by students on the opportunities to provide patient care. Educators can play a role in equipping students, especially female students, with tools to enter into conversations on wages with potential employers.}

It is recognized that thermal perception has an essential impact on people's outdoor activities and use of open space. However, the specific association between influencing factors and the elderly's thermal perception and use of open space has not yet been fully investigated. On-site measurements of thermal conditions were carried out and 485 questionnaire surveys were conducted in six parks in two districts in Hong Kong. The ordered probit model and the binary logistics regression model were employed to investigate the relationship between the factors and the elderly's thermal perceptions, using the measure of thermal comfort, thermal sensation and thermal acceptability and use patterns and satisfaction with using open space. The study adopted a comprehensive framework, which included individual, physical and social and psychological factors. The results show the factors which influence the elderly’s thermal perceptions vary in the winter and summer and there is a significant association between thermal acceptability and satisfaction with open space. Under the trend of global warming, more attention should be paid to mitigate summer heat stress in outdoor space. The empirical findings of the elderly’s thermal perceptions and use patterns of parks in the summer provide insight for urban planners when considering flexible and responsive designs that reflect the special needs of the elderly.}

An efficient supply chain network may contribute to fulfill the customers’ demands in a quick and least cost manner. Therefore, it is important to solve the problem dealt with in this article concerning the design of the distribution network under demand uncertainty. The problem is to determine which warehouses to open and how much space to rent (outsource) in warehouses owned by third-party logistics providers. This paper presents the development and application of the robust optimization methodology to distribution network design problem under demand uncertainty. The proposed method allows the designer to find a network configuration having a total cost that is robust to typical changes in the geographical distribution of the demand. The Algorithm is an iterative process based on Benders decomposition. At each iteration, the following two steps are performed. In the first step, the global design problem (master problem) is solved to decide on the best use of warehouses according to the information provided by the previous iterations. For a given warehouse configuration and under some restrictions on demand variations, the second step determines the demand that incurred the largest transportation cost, granted that the transportation cost is optimal. These steps are repeated until finding the warehouses configuration that gives the smallest worst-case transportation cost. At each iteration the worst-case transportation cost sub-problem provides new information to the global design problem, such that the latter can improve its robustness. We report numerical results for real size network problems. The main results show that a high level of robustness of the distribution network can be achieved at a relatively low cost.}

Therefore the proposed bottom-up model aims to quantify the sustainability of rooftop-farm technologies application in school building stocks, thus permitting an objective comparison and ultimately selection of the best-fitted farm system. This model handles large building samples by combining Statistical Mining Techniques with the Integrated Value Model for Sustainability Assessment. It uses data on the economic, environmental and social aspects of the farms, and relates them to the technical limitations and functionality found in the host buildings. The model has three consecutive stages: 1) in the City Stage reference buildings are identified from the stock, 2) the Building Information Stage determines the logistics and infrastructure requirements; and, 3) the Farm Technology Stage quantifies the farms’ sustainability. This model was used to assess the potential implementation of three rooftop-farms (edible-green roofs, rooftop greenhouses and integrated rooftop greenhouses) in the primary school stock in Quito, Ecuador. Two reference buildings represented the primary school stock of the city; and, in both typologies, edible-green roofs obtained the highest sustainability values of 0.62 and 0.65. The environmental pillar was the most discriminant in which green-roofs achieved twice the sustainability values for the rooftop-greenhouses due to their larger rainwater harvesting capacity, thermal resistance and contribution to the increment of urban greenspaces.}

The challenge for educational institutions is to deal with this broad spectrum. Departments and institution with different specialization are required to work more closely with each other to be able to teach the topic of Industry 4.0 in all its dimensions. One of the approaches of the University of Applied Sciences Emden/Leer is to build a platform, where different departments can work on, collaborate and use it to teach the various aspects of Industry 4.0. This platform is called the “Automated Class Room” and is a physical demonstrator, which consists of many different modules from different departments, such as mechatronic machines, simulation tools, management tools, logistics systems which are integrated into an Industry 4.0 compliant ICT (information-communication technologies) architecture. This paper provides an overview about the platform and discusses in depth how it is currently used for teaching Industry 4.0 to different target audiences. It describes in which parts the individual departments and specific courses set their focus and how they can demonstrate the benefits of Industry 4.0 for students but also for visitors of the university and enterprises. Furthermore, the “Automated Class Room” is used as a practical test bed, where students from different departments can learn together how to implement Industry 4.0 concepts and technologies.

abstract = {Background
Digital twins have advanced fast in various industries, but are just emerging in postharvest supply chains. A digital twin is a virtual representation of a certain product, such as fresh horticultural produce. This twin is linked to the real-world product by sensors supplying data of the environmental conditions near the target fruit or vegetable. Statistical and data-driven twins quantify how quality loss of fresh horticultural produce occurs by grasping patterns in the data. Physics-based twins provide an augmented insight into the underlying physical, biochemical, microbiological and physiological processes, enabling to explain also why this quality loss occurs.
Scope and approach
We identify what the key advantages are of digital twins and how the supply chain of fresh horticultural produce can benefit from them in the future.
Key findings and conclusions
A digital twin has a huge potential to help horticultural produce to tell its history as it drifts along throughout its postharvest life. The reason is that each shipment is subject to a unique and unpredictable set of temperature and gas atmosphere conditions from farm to consumer. Digital twins help to identify the resulting, largely uncharted, postharvest evolution of food quality. The benefit of digital twins particularly comes forward for perishable species and at low airflow rates. Digital twins provide actionable data for exporters, retailers, and consumers, such as the remaining shelf life for each shipment, on which logistics decisions and marketing strategies can be based. The twins also help diagnose and predict potential problems in supply chains that will reduce food quality and induce food loss. Twins can even suggest preventive shipment-tailored measures to reduce retail and household food losses.}

abstract = {The robotic job-shop scheduling problem (RJSP) has become increasingly important due to the wide application of robots for material delivery in modern logistics and supply chain systems. With the common assumptions of negligible material transportation procedures and infinite machine buffers, the traditional job-shop scheduling problem (JSP) models can lead to system failures due to the potential deadlock for a robot-driven production line. In this study, we propose two novel robotic job-shop scheduling models with deadlock and robot movement considerations (RJSPDT). The proposed novel models simultaneously consider the scheduling of job operations and the movement of the robot, with the objective of minimizing makespan. In order to avoid deadlock, the machine blocking strategy is applied and a set of tight deadlock-avoidance constraints is proposed. Two modelling approaches are applied: the traditional position-based approach and the novel network-based approach which is inspired by aviation scheduling studies. Through numerical examples, it is illustrated that our proposed models can completely avoid transportation conflicts by considering deadlock and robot movement. Besides, through computational experiments, the network-based RJSPDT shows higher solution efficiency owing to the smaller model size than the position-based RJSPDT (e.g., reducing the computational time by 96% for small-scale problems). Moreover, we explore the impacts of job settings (e.g., number of jobs, number of operations in a job) and job entrance strategies (i.e., fixed entrance and flexible entrance) on model performances. Results show that the number of jobs imposes greater impacts than the number of operations in a job, while the fixed entrance strategy can reduce the average computational time by 60% with little impact on the makespan.}

abstract = {This paper analyzes the contestedness of contemporary operations of capital by looking at the conflictual constellation between corporate security frameworks and ‘logistical resistance’. In recent years, protest movements around the world have engaged in acts of logistical resistance – such as blocking ports, occupying financial districts and disrupting infrastructural flows – with the intention of rendering capitalist transactions inoperable. Corporate actors increasingly regard these movements as threats to their operations and implement security frameworks such as Business Continuity Management (BCM) in finance and Supply Chain Security (SCS) in logistics. These security strategies help to maintain connectivity between heterogeneous operations of capital. Logistical resistance targets this connectivity and constitutes a threat to endeavours to ‘secure circulation’. We analyze the uneasy relationship between logistical resistance and corporate security strategies. To do so we adopt an operational perspective that provides a particularly revealing lens for looking at technologies of security, which try to protect and maintain operations, as well as practices of resistance that try to disrupt or block them. We argue that both practices of resilience and resistance rely on and enact a particular ontology of operations. We combine our conceptual considerations concerning operations of capital, security and resistance with an analysis of particular cases: the role of BCM during public protests in Frankfurt’s financial district which attempted to interrupt the banking business, and the role of SCS during attempts to block seaports in the context of Occupy Oakland and demonstrations against a recent G20 summit in Hamburg.}
