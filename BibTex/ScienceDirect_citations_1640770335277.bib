abstract = {Sustainable freight transportation is a logistics approach that provides affordable services to consumers where environmental, economic, and social sustainability dimensions are concerned. Governments usually improve sustainability dimensions in freight transportation by imposing taxes on transportation systems. Therefore, they should extend their knowledge on interactions between sustainability dimensions and how their interventions affect each dimension. In this regard, we analyze competition between two freight transportation systems in the context of government intervention. These systems include road and intermodal road–rail transportation modes, where the latter is regarded as an environmentally sustainable mode. A sequential game is addressed to analyze the duopoly competition. In the upper level, a government, as a Stackelberg leader, imposes taxes on fuel usage based on environmental, economic, and social concerns. In the lower level, a Nash game is developed to analyze price competition in the transportation market. Our analyses reveal that: (a) Given a fixed level of the consumers' loyalty to their specific transportation systems, economic and social sustainability are consistent with each other, while they conflict with environmental sustainability. (b) Economic risks increase economic sustainability requested by the transportation systems. Such a relationship and the mentioned conflict between environmental and economic sustainability imply that a reduction of economic risks by the government indirectly contributes to environmental sustainability. (c) An increase in the consumers' loyalty simultaneously improves the three sustainability dimensions. (d) The energy efficiency improvements of the transportation systems may pose adverse environmental and social effects, called the rebound effects. Moreover, government intervention effectively eliminates such rebound effects. (e) Government support for the service enhancement of the intermodal system, combined with the national advertisement of this system, may exempt the government from subsidy payment.}

abstract = {Torrefaction and slow pyrolysis are processes that can be used for improving the fuel properties of low-quality biomass, which could be effectively used for improving fuel logistics and making biomass a fully tradeable commodity. Automation of these processes could prove vital for their economic viability and carbon footprint, giving the possibility to reduce manpower requirement and raining time for operators. Automation based on online control of the quality of biocoal is not possible. However, finding a suitable marker in torgas could make automation possible. Results presented in the study show that formaldehyde can be considered as a viable marker. Obtained results are limited to torrefaction and slow pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass at a maximum reactor temperature of 430 °C. Temperature measurements show that endothermal evaporation of the bound moisture delays the time necessary to reach the point where exothermal reactions start taking a leading role in the thermal decomposition process, which is extremely important in the context of thermal run-away of such installation. Artificial neural network proved to be an effective tool for determining of correlation between the heating value of pyrolysis gas and its concentration of formaldehyde. This could be used in advanced control solutions for pyrolysis gas combustion systems.}

A classification of the materials has been done considering the importance of each of them. To obtain a complete overview of the problem, different criteria have been compared: the cost, the scarcity of the material and the affections these materials can cause not only to the environment but also to the humans. This classification has been used to identify which are the most critical materials. Moreover, other transversal issues have been studied as the regulations that apply to FCH technologies from a paneuropean perspective and the strategies to face the end-of-life of this equipment. A holistic point of view has been considered in order to see how the process of dismantling and recycling faces different problems and which milestones to achieve in a future with a deep market penetration are.}

abstract = {Background
Atrial fibrillation (AF) increases the risk of stroke. It can be asymptomatic and patients may be unaware they have AF. Therefore, there is a need to develop a sustainable community model to screen for unrecognized AF.
Objective
The objective is to assess a curriculum driven model developed by the University of New Mexico College of Pharmacy (UNM-CoP) to evaluate AF screening at three community pharmacy sites.
Methods
Screenings and education for AF were performed by fourth year pharmacy students during their advanced pharmacy practice experience (APPE) community rotation at pre-selected independent pharmacies. Patients were screened using the KardiaMobile device (AliveCor®, Mountain View, California), an FDA-cleared device that interprets a medical-grade ECG in 30 seconds. All screening materials and devices were provided by UNM-CoP. Semi-structured interviews with each targeted pharmacy were conducted to assess the logistics, value, and sustainability of the program (N=5 pharmacists).
Results
AF assessment was performed over a 7-month period by 8 students at three pharmacies. Students screened a total of 63 patients (62% female, 56 ± 14 years of age) with 92% of the encounters taking less than 10 minutes to complete. Three patients (4.7%) were found to have possible AF. Positive scores were noted when assessing value to the pharmacy (8.8 ± 0.8, scale 1-10 with 10 being high value) and professionally (9.7 ± 0.6).
Discussion
Student-pharmacists provides a likely pathway for sustainability for this clinical initiative and provides for a novel and measurable APPE patient interaction.
Conclusion
Curricular driven AF assessment in community pharmacies was shown to be a feasible model. Additional studies are needed to assess whether population-based real-time assessment and detection of AF can reduce the risk of stroke in previously undetected AF. If stroke reduction is realized, reimbursement for service is likely and can contribute to further sustainability.}

abstract = {Many manufacturing companies experience increasing product variety, which not only leads to significantly increased operations’ costs but also to an uneven distribution of these costs across product variants. To deal with this challenge, managers need to accurately quantify the costs of product variety-induced complexity to understand its impact on company revenues. However, quantifying complexity costs is no trivial task, as both the variety-related factors that generate more complexity and the costs implied by these factors are specific to each company. Therefore, we extensively reviewed the relevant literature to build a list of possible complexity cost factors generated by product variety, which are here named variety-induced complexity cost factors (VCCFs). This list is intended to be used by managers as a reference set of VCCFs to help identify and subsequently quantify the costs of product variety-related complexity in manufacturing companies and finally attribute them to end product variants. To evaluate the usefulness of this list, the identified VCCFs were examined in six companies using both the judgment of managers and data from their enterprise resource planning systems. This empirical examination not only provides evidence of the usefulness of this list but also data, rarely available in academic literature, on the costs of product variety-induced complexity and its proportion of company revenue. It also suggests that it is important to research effective ways to get, elaborate, and present data to calculate the costs of product variety-related complexity and reports a viable approach used in six companies.}

Brazil, a prominent food producer, has high levels of food losses and, consequently, loss/waste of natural resources. This study estimated the loss of energetic and nutritional potentials, as well as the economic loss, associated with rice (Oryza sativa L.) and maize (Zea mays L.) losses in Brazil, analyzing available data of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) regarding food supply, food losses, and gross production value of rice and maize in Brazil from 2014 to 2018. The analysis revealed that the average annual loss of maize and rice in Brazil is approximately 8.3 million tons and 1.2 million tons respectively, enough to feed about 37 million people per year, or to produce 3.67 billion liters of bioethanol. Also, the average annual gross economic loss associated with maize and rice losses in Brazil is estimated at US$ 1.7 billion. This study reinforces the need for better public and private initiatives in Brazil to reduce the high levels of grain loss, recommending increasing investments in logistics infrastructure and grain transportation modalities, the adoption of more appropriate transport and storage practices, use of stricter regulatory measures, and systematic monitoring of the efficiency of Brazilian food systems.}

abstract = {In the 20th century, there has been a significant development in logistics systems owing to market globalisation. From this perspective, our study focuses on designing novel models of inventory systems to reflect these real-time systems with improved accuracy and eventually design optimal control systems. Many mathematical inventory models lack details. Most of the existing models in the literature neglect the inclusion of closing days despite the shortening of the shelf-lifes of perishable items daily. In this study, a hybrid dynamic discrete-time inventory model with random lifetime perishable products, first in–first out (FIFO) and last in-first out (LIFO) issuing policies, positive lead time, and time-varying demand, including closing days, is developed. It is assumed that the demand is an external input to the model, and thus, it is easy to implement or test various market scenarios. The developed model is fitted to real data obtained from the research on the formation of botulinum toxin on packaged cubed melons and microbial spoilage at various incubation temperatures. Our study shows that the implementation of the Weibull distribution in modelling perishability can improve the accuracy of reflecting the performance of real physical inventory systems. We compare the developed model to an existing one in the literature, considering different issuing policies: FIFO, LIFO, and their combination. The study also includes a comparative analysis of the fixed and random lifetimes of products in terms of closing days.}

The potentially curative clinical outcome of these therapies diverges from the traditional pharmaceutical model of ongoing treatment and in the case of autologous (personalized) ATs, shifts away from the current “one-size-fits-all” therapeutic development approach to one that is centered around individual patient needs. This novel therapeutic modality offers the potential for safer, targeted medicines, however new manufacturing models and supply chains will need to be developed to facilitate their cost-effective production and timely delivery. Never before has the supply chain and associated logistics been so deeply interconnected and embedded in the manufacturing process for therapeutic development. Whilst this presents inherent challenges and critical translational bottlenecks that must be addressed to deliver these ATs, it also presents opportunities for creative solutions, new value chains and innovative approaches.}

abstract = {Background
The 2017–2018 influenza season was associated with high demand for both emergency department (ED) care and inpatient acute care for influenza-like illness (ILI). This high demand resulted in increased numbers of inpatients and ED patients, including prolonged ED length of stay. A large, urban, academic medical center in a cold-weather region was limited in its ability to expand its footprint to create de novo locations of care, such as temporary outbuildings or tents. As such, a large conference room was rapidly converted and placed in service as a temporary inpatient unit for adults requiring inpatient admission.
Logistics and Implementation
The logistical, infection prevention, safety, information technology, staffing, and other concerns of creating a clinical environment during a high demand scenario is challenging. However, the lessons learned in this study are reproducible despite the complexity of this issue.
Conclusion
This is believed to be the first published account of successful conversion of a nonclinical area to an operational clinical unit in response to a surge in demand for hospital care and admission. This may be a valid option for hospitals of all sizes as part of a surge or disaster plan.}

Infection with EBOV can cause a severe viral haemorrhagic fever with no licensed vaccine or treatment, restricting work with live EBOV to Containment/Biosafety Level 4 facilities. Whilst the magnitude of recent outbreaks has provided an impetus for vaccine and antiviral development, establishing the efficacy of candidate vaccine materials relies on EBOV challenge models and advanced human trials should outbreaks occur and where logistics and funding allow. To address these hurdles in vaccine development, we investigated whether a recently established serological reference standard, the 1st WHO International Standard for Ebola virus antibody, could be used to provide a quantifiable correlate of immune protection in vivo. Dilutions of the International Standard were inoculated into naïve guinea pigs 24 h before challenge with a lethal dose of Ebola virus. Only subjects receiving the highest dose of the International Standard exhibited evidence of delayed progression. Due to it being a WHO established reagent and available globally upon request, this standard allows for effective comparisons of data between laboratories and may prove valuable to select the candidate vaccines that are most likely to confer humoral immune protection ensuring the most promising candidates progress into efficacy studies.}

The technologies discussed are reforming natural gas; gasification of coal and biomass; and the splitting of water by water electrolysis, photo-electrolysis, photobiological production, and high-temperature decomposition. For all hydrogen production processes, there is a need for significant improvement in plant efficiencies, for reduced capital costs, and for better reliability and operating flexibility. In the medium to long term, centralized fossil fuel-based production of hydrogen, with the capture and storage of CO2, could be the technology of choice. However, the capture and storage of CO2 are not yet technically and commercially proven. Further Research and Development (R&D) on the processes of absorption and separation is required. Other methods for hydrogen production are further away from commercialization and need additional R&D. The production of hydrogen from biomass needs additional focus on the preparation and logistics of the feed, and such production will probably only be economical at a larger scale. Photo-electrolysis is at an early stage of development, and material costs and practical issues have yet to be solved. The photobiological processes are at a very early stage of development with only low conversion efficiencies obtained so far. High-temperature processes need further materials development that focuses on high-temperature membranes and heat exchangers.}

These protocols, although very costly and usually exhaustive, are prone to human errors and infractions that can become fatal. Localization techniques and communication technologies are two excellent means to help minimize latent risks for worker’s safety. This work describes a set of lessons learned in real initiatives for remote monitoring of workers’ activities in refineries. It focuses especially on aspects beyond technical issues usually treated in the literature, i.e., deployment, logistics, and sociological issues.}

abstract = {A task of the Arctic integrated development affects the development of the new safe and waste-free technologies of waste processing using hydrogen electric power generation. This problem is multifaceted and concerns both large port cities and small towns, mines, islands, platforms, mining and processing plants, etc., despite the fact that many of them have not removed the wastes from their previous activities. The presence of melting permafrost, especially in the Western part of the Russian Arctic, high logistics costs, a small number of indigenous people and mainly rotational method of development make use of new technologies for the production of electricity, heat, water treatment, which provide the use of hydrogen power on the basis of liquefied natural gas (LNG). The use of LNG as a fuel is not effective enough, especially in the Arctic, given the low efficiency of diesel and gas turbine power plants, as well as the environmental degradation from their use. A more effective, environmentally friendly and integrated solution is the use of hydrogen electric power generation together with hydrogen fuel cells (HFC). The structure and method of waste-free technologies of waste processing are analyzed. The structure of wastes is multifaceted and contains: the most common solid waste from industry and life, including natural and man-made landfills; liquid wastes including sewage sludge from household and rainwater, oil-containing and other industrial wastes; leachate from landfills, including landfill gases; wastes resulted from transportation and transshipment of oil products, etc. In the paper purification methods are described; industrial shipping equipment and its characteristics for the application at facilities of the Arctic are presented. These installations include: incinerators, installations for treatment and filtrate of sewage from municipal solid wastes (MSW), desalination plants of reverse osmosis, snow-and ice-melting installations, cleaning and filtration of flue gases with an emphasis on methods of electric cleaning, cargo arms for loading and unloading the oil products and hazardous wastes. The advantages of hydrogen sources and energy storage using LNG in the Arctic both in terms of energy efficiency and ecology, the possibility of their use in conjunction with the above waste treatment plants are shown. Characteristics of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) and solid polymer fuel cells and their scope are presented. For the most dynamically developing solid oxide elements, their characteristics in the traditional and cogeneration cycles are given and the scope of their application in small and distributed energy at power up to 10 kW is shown. Atmospheric hybrid schemes for thermodynamic efficiency are significantly inferior to schemes under pressure, but in large-capacity plants, for example, with coal gasification, they can be quite promising. Modern SOFC work under pressure of 7–9 bar; with the growth of their capacity over 1–5 MW in hybrid power plants (HPPs) it is necessary to increase the pressure up to 11 bar and even more. For HPPs with capacity over 10 MW, cogeneration cycle with gas turbines (CCGT) is the most efficient. The highest electrical efficiency of HPPs with the capacity over 10 MW reaches 75% with the use of CCGT and boilers at three pressure units with intermediate superheating. The paper presents the characteristics of traditional sources of electricity based on ship and aircraft gas turbine units operating on LNG, which can be used in autonomous power supply networks of Arctic facilities. Their advantages in terms of specific power in comparison with diesel power plants and storage devices are shown, but high LNG consumption and environmental indicators limit their use in the Arctic, taking into account the logistics problems. Comparison of the energy efficiency of traditional sources and hydrogen storage shows significant advantages of the latter, and if the efficiency of traditional sources increases with their power, the efficiency of storage devices does not change in the entire range of capacities. This circumstance makes the use of hydrogen sources and accumulators uncontested in the field of small capacities typical for Arctic consumers, especially taking into account the possibilities for safe and waste-free technology for processing industrial and life wastes.}

We assessed the possibility to rule out negative urine cultures by counting with UriSed 3 PRO (77 Elektronika, Hungary) at Helsinki and Uusimaa Hospital District.
Materials and methods
Bacteria counting of the UriSed 3 PRO automated microscope was verified with reference phase contrast microscopy against growth in culture. After acceptance into routine, results of bacteria and leukocyte counting from 56 426 specimens with eight UriSed 3 PRO instruments were compared against results from parallel samples cultured on chromogenic agar. Laboratory data including preanalytical details were accessed through the regional database of the Helsinki and Uusimaa Hospital District.
Results
A combined sensitivity of 87–92% and a negative predictive value of 90–96% with a specificity of 54–50% was reached, depending on criteria. Preanalytical data (incubation time in bladder) combined with the way of urine collection would improve these figures if reliable.
Conclusions
Complex patient populations, regional logistics and data interfases, and economics related to increased costs of additional particle counts against costs of screening cultures of all samples, did not support adaptation of a screening process of urine cultures. This conclusion was made locally, and may not be valid elsewhere.}

It helps the transportation and distribution companies in routing by aiding to establish a proper balance between the number of vehicles and total distance. In this work combined objective capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP) is considered. CVRP is a combinatorial optimization problem in which a fleet of vehicles with limits on capacity are available to service a set of customers from a central depot with their individual demands known in advance. Genetic Algorithm technique is adopted to solve the problem. Performance of GA’s largely depends on the type of genetic operators used. In this work two different crossovers are selected and an attempt is made to bring out the impact of these selected crossovers on the quality of solutions generated. Since the focus is on two objectives of VRP i.e. the number of vehicles and the distance, the fitness assignment procedure with GA known as Fitness Aggregated Genetic Algorithm (FAGA) is employed. The model is validated using information obtained from a distribution firm. The result suggests that the proposed algorithm is highly competitive and extremely efficient for combined objective optimization of vehicle routing.}

Children with visual impairments (VIs) face challenges in social play activities, which limits their opportunities to practice social skills.
Aims
We investigated whether augmented toys were effective to facilitate play in 52 children with VIs who attended special schools for students with visual impairments and blindness.
Methods and procedures
52 children with VIs (mean age: 9.22 years, SD = 2.07) played three times with both an augmented and a non-augmented toy. A Playmobil® knight’s castle was augmented with Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology, such that each play figure produced audio feedback during play. The RFID-technology could be activated and deactivated. Social and cognitive aspects of play were coded from video and data were analyzed using multilevel logistics.
Outcomes and results
Children showed less disengagement and more parallel play, but less cooperative play when they used the augmented versus the non-augmented castle. This pattern persisted after repeated play sessions with both toys.
Conclusions
The addition of sounds to physical toys increased shared attention between children with VIs during the exploration of play materials, yet it interfered with social interaction during peer play.}

The RFID reading and writing system based on Zig Bee technology is developed, and focuses on the hardware interface circuit design of the fusion system, the development of compatible communication protocols, the anti-collision algorithm, and the transmission performance of the system under two outdoor environments. The design of the environmental collection terminal uses relevant sensors to collect the transport environment data in the carriage. And Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) combined with General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) technology realizes the function of the main aggregation node of wireless sensors. The method achieves data aggregation and data transmission, and the development of the application platform of the monitoring system uses software technology. Based on the browser/server (B/S) architecture, the development of the monitoring system is finally realized. Finally, the cold chain transportation simulation experiment was conducted to test the system, and the results showed that the hardware of the cold chain coordination monitoring system can work normally and the software design of the monitoring system can meet the basic requirements of the system for the third-party logistics enterprises. The efficiency of our results is improved by about 10% compared to other studies, and their accuracy is improved to a higher degree, which makes our model more practical.}

keywords = {Kidney transplantation, Barriers, Referral, Evaluation},
abstract = {Background
In the United States (US), barriers in access to later steps in the kidney transplantation process (i.e. waitlisting) have been well documented. Barriers in access to earlier steps (i.e. referral and evaluation) are less well described due to the lack of national surveillance data. In this review, we summarize the available literature on non-medical barriers in access to kidney transplant referral and evaluation.
Methods
Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a scoping review of the literature through June 3, 2021. We included all studies (quantitative and qualitative) reporting on barriers to kidney transplant referral and evaluation in the US published from 1990 onwards in English and among adult end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42014015027). We narratively synthesized results across studies.
Results
We retrieved information from 33 studies published from 1990 to 2021 (reporting data between 1990 and 2018). Most studies (n = 28, 85%) described barriers among patient populations, three (9%) among provider populations, and two (6%) included both patients and providers. Key barriers were identified across multiple levels and included patient- (e.g. demographic, socioeconomic, sociocultural, and knowledge), provider- (e.g. miscommunication, staff availability, provider perceptions and attitudes), and system- (e.g. geography, distance to care, healthcare logistics) level factors.
Conclusions
A multi-pronged approach (e.g. targeted and systemwide interventions, and policy change) implemented at multiple levels of the healthcare system will be necessary to reduce identified barriers in access to early kidney transplant steps. Collection of national surveillance data on these early kidney transplant steps is also needed to enhance our understanding of barriers to referral and evaluation.}

abstract = {This paper proposes a novel matheuristic algorithm for solving the Production Routing Problem (PRP). The PRP is a hard-to-solve combinatorial optimization problem with numerous practical applications in the field of freight transportation, logistics and supply chain management. A manufacturer is responsible for determining production decisions, as well as the timing and the quantity of replenishment services offered to a set of geographically dispersed customers over a multi-period time horizon. The problem calls for jointly optimizing the production, inventory, distribution and routing decisions. The paper provides a novel two-commodity flow formulation and proposes a two-phase infeasible space matheuristic algorithm for solving the examined problem. The first phase deals with a relaxation of the problem to construct production-distribution plans. In the second phase, these are completed with routing information and optimized via a local search framework which oscillates between the feasible and the infeasible solution space. The framework is equipped with mixed integer programming components for restoring infeasibility and for diversifying the conducted search. Computational experiments demonstrate that the infeasibility space exploration significantly contributes to the quality of the final solutions. The results obtained by the proposed matheuristic out-match the results of state-of-the-art approaches. More specifically, 594 and 55 new best solutions out of 1440 and 90 instances of two well-established benchmark data sets of small-medium and large instances are reported, respectively.}

Although many publications indicate that renewables are already a cost-effective solution, especially for economies dependent on expensive fuels, the conventional generation is still the main source of electricity on isolated systems, even in recent projects. This paper presents suggestions of public policies to stimulate the use of environmentally friendly energy sources at off-grid places in Brazil and discusses the probable reasons why this transition has not been driven yet, including barriers related to subsidies, energy tariffs and tax rules. To evaluate these policies, a multicriteria decision model was developed using the AHP (Analytical Hierarchy Process) and TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) methods, combined with fuzzy logic. Eighteen criteria were assessed, and ten specialists were interviewed. The study concluded that pilot projects of hybrid power plants, combining diesel engines and renewable technologies, would be the most effective policy. Other relevant policies pointed as relevant were the simplification of environmental licensing for projects based on renewables and the adoption of a more mandatory energy planning.}

In this contribution, ammonia and biogas are considered for high-efficient electricity production in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). It is demonstrated that the properties and operating conditions of SOFC allow for direct use of these fuels, with fuel pretreatment inside the SOFC anode.

abstract = {Background
Between 25%-50% of patients hospitalized with (COVID-19) suffer cardiovascular events. Limited information is available to identify those at greatest risk for cardiac complications.
Objectives
Objectives were to analyze risk factors associated with cardiovascular events (CE); analyze whether risk factors and outcomes were influenced by race; and analyze survival differences among various groups.
Methods
This retrospective cohort study of 700 inpatients with COVID-19 was conducted at nine hospitals within a large urban midwestern city. Data was collected from March 9, 2020, to June 20, 2020. Inclusion criteria included all COVID-19 inpatients and excluded non-inpatients. Predictor variables included demographics, comorbidities, and current clinical data. The outcomes were heart failure (HF), deep-vein thrombosis, myocardial infarction, pulmonary edema, stroke, cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, reduced ejection fraction, cardiac arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, and cardiac arrest. Pearson's correlation coefficients were used to evaluate the correlation between different variables. Multiple logistics regression analyses were conducted to examine which variables predict cardiovascular events for the entire cohort, African American patients, and white patients, respectively. Mann-Whitney U, Chi-square, or Fisher's exact tests were used to examine differences in groups with and without CE and Kaplan-Meier was conducted for survival comparisons between groups.
Results
Of 700 COVID-19 positive inpatients, 126 experienced cardiovascular events and 574 did not. The incidence of cardiovascular events in our sample population was 18%. As shown in Table 1, we found the following factors were highly associated with the odds of new-onset of CEs: advanced age in years, males, non-Hispanic African American, presence of comorbidities, and decreased saturation levels. Numerous laboratory values were significantly associated with the risk of CEs (Table 1). African Americans had greater odds of CEs in the presence of diabetes and cardiovascular comorbidities (p=0.008, p=0.014, respectively). However, multiple logistics analysis was used to examine the joint effect of the risk factors which suggested that lower serum albumin and neoplastic/immune compromised diseases count were highly associated with CEs for African American COVID-19 inpatients (p=0.001, p=0.044, respectively). SaO2/FiO2 ratio and cardiovascular comorbidities were significantly associated with CEs for white inpatients (p=<0.001, p=0.007, respectively). As shown in Figure 1, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed inpatients with CEs had a much higher mortality rate than those without CEs (45.2% vs. 8.7%). Median survival for patients with CEs was 18 days as opposed to 100 days for those that did not experience CEs. African Americans with CEs experienced higher mortality than those without CEs (43.9% vs. 7.8%). White COVID-19 inpatients' mortality rates were 46.3% and 9.0% for those with and without CEs, respectively. Of the 126 COVID-19 inpatients who had a CE, 14.3% had cardiac arrhythmias and 8.7% had new onset of HF diagnoses, and 4.8% had acute myocardial infarctions.
Conclusion
Multiple risk factors for CEs and death were identified in this sample of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, and mortality was increased significantly in those inpatients who had CEs. HF, cardiac arrhythmia, and acute myocardial infarction were the most frequently cited CEs implicating the need for long-term follow-up.}

However, this assumption does not apply for logistics operations in cities with significant road grades. We study an extension to the VRP model that plans vehicle routes considering the combined impact of detailed road grade information and vehicle load-weight in fuel consumption cost. We refer to this model as the VRP with Steep Roads (VRP-SR), which is formulated as an integer linear program and solved heuristically. In simulated experiments performed for a mountainous metropolitan region in Chile, we estimate operating cost reductions up to 12.4% when compared to the real cost of a plan disregarding road grade information. In addition, we obtain valuable managerial insights from our routing plans; our planned routes tend to initially use roads with relatively small grades to avoid abrupt altitude changes with a loaded vehicle. Higher altitude changes are planned after the vehicle unloads a significant fraction of its cargo. Also, we identify instances in which it is cheaper to insert an intermediate depot visit to drop off weight and split a feasible route in two subroutes to travel over mountainous areas with a lighter vehicle.}

Minimal access surgery is not available to most people in rural areas of low-to middle-income countries. This leads to an increase in morbidity and economic loss to the poor and marginalized. Gasless laparoscopic (GAL) procedures are possible in rural areas because they can be performed under spinal anesthesia. In most cases, it does not require the logistics of providing gases for pneumoperitoneum and general anesthesia. The current study compares GAL with conventional laparoscopic (COL) operations for general surgical procedures.

A single-center, nonblinded randomized controlled trial was conducted to evaluate noninferiority of GAL vs COL at a teaching hospital in New Delhi, India. Patients were allocated into 3 groups and underwent minimal access surgery (cholecystectomies and appendectomies). The procedures were performed by 2 surgeons choosing randomly between GAL and COL. The data were collected by postgraduates and analyzed by a biostatistician.
Results
One hundred patients who met the inclusion criteria were allocated into 2 groups. No significant difference was observed in the mean operating time between the GAL group (52.9 minutes) and the COL group (55 minutes) (p = 0.3). Intraoperative vital signs were better in the GAL group (p < 0.05). The postoperative pain score was slightly higher in the GAL group (p = 0.01); however, it did not require additional analgesics.
Conclusions
No significant differences were found between the 2 groups. GAL can be considered as noninferior compared with COL and has the potential to be adopted in low-resource settings.}

abstract = {In this paper we consider the sourcing process of a production facility from the process industry. The production facility sources raw materials from a set of suppliers that offer different discount schemes. For storing raw materials, heterogeneous storage facilities can be used, which vary with respect to their associated costs and capacities. We formulate the corresponding planning problem of selecting suppliers and storage facilities as well as determining order quantities and transport flows under the discount schemes offered by the suppliers. For solving large problem instances, a heuristic based on kernel search is proposed and evaluated in a real world case study. The case study reveals that supplier selection and storage selection are highly interdependent decisions. By integrating both perspectives, significant savings can be generated. It turns out that single-sourcing is the dominant strategy for most raw materials. However, the selection of the optimal suppliers depends on both the prices offered by the suppliers as well as the associated logistics costs for transportation and stock-holding.}

In this problem, a fleet of vehicles can service a set of customers earlier and later than the required time with a given tolerance. This flexibility enables a logistics company to save distribution costs at the expense of customer satisfaction. This paper uses a direct interpretation of the vehicle routing problem with flexible time windows (VRPFlexTW) as a multi-objective problem, where the total distribution costs (including travel costs and fixed vehicle costs) are minimized and the overall customer satisfaction is maximized. We propose a solution strategy based on ant colony optimization and three mutation operators, which incorporates the concept of Pareto optimality for multi-objective optimization. The performance of the proposed approach was evaluated using the well-known benchmark Solomon’s problems. Our experimental results show that the suggested approach is effective, because it provides solutions that are comparative to the best known results in the literatures. Finally, we not only highlight the advantages of MOVRPFlexTW when compared with the single objective VRPFlexTW, but also illustrate its applicability and validation by analyzing a real case.}

We focus on the supply and maintenance of rifles, among many other types of weaponry, as they are the very basic armament of the rank and file. In a modern army, every soldier is trained to disassemble and reassemble a rifle. However, a damaged rifle still must be transported to the nearest unit specialized in repairing, adding a logistics hurdle to an already-busy fighting unit. Carrying numerous spare parts just to repair rifles could hurt the fighting unit’s mobility. Thus, in this research, we developed Integer Programming model and analysed the efficiency of the model of distributing an affordable 3D printing capacity to combat units in straightening out the rifle repairing process. The usage of 3D printers allows more centralized control and efficient utilization of raw materials.

abstract = {Background and aims
Gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE) is characterized by angliodysplastic lesions that can cause upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The mechanism behind GAVE and its association with other diseases remains unknown. We investigated the association of metabolic syndrome in cirrhotic GAVE patients when compared to esophageal variceal hemorrhage (EVH) patients.
Methods
We performed a retrospective review of 941 consecutive esophagogastroduodenoscopies (EGDs) for UGIB at a medical center between 2017 and 2019. The GAVE group consisted of EGD or biopsy diagnosed cirrhotic GAVE patients, and the EVH group consisted of EVH patients with active bleeding or stigmata of recent hemorrhage on EGD. Baseline variables including co-morbidities and cirrhotic etiology were recorded. Continuous variables were compared using Wilcoxon test and categorical variables were compared using Chi-square or Fisher's exact test. Multiple logistic regression analysis evaluated the association between GAVE and covariates.
Results
The final cohort had 96 GAVE and 104 EVH patients. Mean BMI was significantly higher in the GAVE cohort (32.6 vs 27.9, p < 0.0001) in addition to diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia (53.1% vs 37.5%; 76% vs 47.1%; 38.5% vs 14.4%; respectively, all p < 0.05). Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) cirrhosis was more prevalent in GAVE than EVH patients (50% vs 24%, p = 0.0001). Multiple logistics regression revealed female sex, increased BMI, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia all having significantly higher risk of GAVE (all p < 0.05).
Conclusion
Our data indicates that when compared to cirrhotics patients with EVH, cirrhotics with GAVE have increased risk of metabolic syndrome. This may play a role in the underlying pathophysiology of GAVE.}

In this study, the impact of wastewater on the western shore of Admiralty Bay was investigated during austral summer in 2017 and 2019. A range of physicochemical parameters and the presence of selected trace metals, formaldehyde and different groups of surfactants were determined in wastewater coming from Arctowski Station and in nearby coastal waters. The presence of selected trace metals (e.g., Cr: 2.7–4.4 μg/L; Zn: 15.2–37.3 μg/L; and Ni: 0.9–23.3 μg/L) and the sums of cationic (0.3–1.5 mg/L), anionic (3.1–1.7 mg/L), and non-ionic (0.6–2.4 mg/L) surfactants in wastewater indicated the potential influence of anthropogenic factors on sea water. The determined surfactants are found in many hygiene products that end up in the waste water tank after human use and, if untreated, can be released into surface waters with discharge. In addition, the levels of some trace metals indicate that they cannot come only from natural sources, but are the result of human activity. The reported data show disturbances in the marine environment caused by non-treated wastewater discharge, e.g. by comparing the obtained results from the values of the no observed effect concentrations (NOECs) on selected Antarctic bioindicators, and provide information for the implementation of proper wastewater treatment at any Antarctic station in the future.}

MiC offers a range of benefits including cost-effectiveness, high productivity, and high sustainability for construction industry. Multiple stakeholders in MiC project, such as project client, module manufacturer, logistics company, and building contractor, normally use their own proprietary and centralized Enterprise Information System (EIS). However, stakeholders are facing challenges to share information throughout MiC projects. “Islands of Information” issue is commonly existing and creates information fragmentation and discontinuity. As an emerging Information and Communication Technology (ICT), blockchain provides unified standards and protocols for information sharing based on decentralized P2P framework with enhanced transparency and security. Aiming to address the information fragmentation and discontinuity in MiC project, this paper proposes a blockchain-enabled cyber-physical smart MiC platform to facilitate cross-enterprise information sharing among multiple stakeholders based on User-Centered Design (UCD) method. A practical roadmap is presented for the design, development, deployment, and application of MiC blockchain with new opportunities and guidelines. Initial investigations based on an industrial collaborated company are analyzed and the blockchain-enabled cyber-physical MiC workflow is designed. The user-centered blockchain explorers with high-fidelity digital twins are illustrated. Some preliminary results are found that MiC blockchain not only facilitates cyber-physical construction progress traceability, and real-time KPI visualization & evaluation, but also improves the information reliability, immutability, and transparency in MiC projects.}

In this context, the main driver is establishing feedstocks with lower environmental loads and higher energy use efficiency. The objective of this study was to evaluate the energy requirement and environmental impacts of hydroprocessed renewable jet fuel (HRJ) production from pennycress. The system boundary included pennycress production, logistics, oil extraction and conversion to HRJ, wastewater treatment, and electricity and steam generation. Energy allocation method was used for the analysis. The functional unit was considered to be one GJ of HRJ, and the biorefinery size was considered to be 18.9 million l/yr (5 million gal/yr) HRJ. Energy use efficiency of pennycress-based HRJ production was estimated to be 3.9–5.5 (90% central range), which was higher than that of HRJ from other oilseeds, such as canola. Global warming potential of pennycress-based HRJ (35–49 kgCO2eq/GJ of HRJ (90% central range)) was also lower than those of HRJ from similar oilseeds and the commercial jet fuel baseline. Pennycress production was the main contributor to the total energy use and environmental impacts of HRJ production, mainly due to the use of nitrogen fertilizer for production, and fuel combustion for farm operations. Pennycress yield was identified as the most sensitive parameter affecting the energy use efficiency and environmental impacts of HRJ production. The outcomes of this study are useful for identifying the performance targets towards improving energy use efficiency and environmental performance of pennycress-based HRJ production at the commercial scale.}

Furthermore, many options exist on how to reduce and abate emissions. They can be of pure technical character, such as installation of exhaust gas treatment in a ship, or relate to ship operation and logistics, for example, slow steaming when approaching the port. In this chapter a selection of these abatement measures is discussed and put in the context of who has the power to increase the environmental performance of ships in port.}

Different types of sensors are available as per the suitability and applications; some of them are produced in mass and available in the market at affordable costs. The standard sensor types available are position sensors, pressure sensors, flow sensors, temperature sensors, and force sensors. They are used in many sectors, such as motorsport, medical, industry, aerospace, agriculture, and daily life. The objective of Industry 4.0 is to increase efficiency through automation. Sensors are vital components of Industry 4.0, allowing several transitions such as changes in positions, length, height, external and dislocations in industrial production facilities to be detected, measured, analysed, and processed. Smart factories will also enhance sustainability by tracking real-time output, and automated control systems will minimise potential factory maintenance costs. It can also be seen that digitalisation can improve production mobility, which gives advanced manufacturing firms a competitive advantage. This paper discusses sensors and their various types, along with significant capabilities for manufacturing. The step-by-step working Blocks and Quality Services of Sensors during implementation in Industry 4.0 are elaborated diagrammatically. Finally, we identified thirteen significant applications of sensors for Industry 4.0. Industry 4.0 provides an excellent opportunity for the development of the sensor market across the globe. In Industry 4.0, sensors will enjoy higher acceptance rates and benefit from a fully enabled connecting and data exchange and logistics integration.

This problem emanates from logistics related to biogas transportation in which biogas is transported in containers from many suppliers to a single facility. We present a novel and compact formulation for the supply-driven IRP which addresses the routing decisions in continuous-time in which inventory levels within the containers are continuous. Valid inequalities are included and realistic instances are solved to optimality. For all experiments, we found that the total transportation time is minimized when the storage capacity at each supplier is larger than or equal to the vehicle capacity. These routes are characterized by tours in which mostly single suppliers are visited. In 95% of the instances, the average content level of the exchanged containers exceeded 99.6%.}

Transport and collection of biomass as well as non-uniform material characteristics are issues related to decreasing efficiency of logistics and fuel manipulation which can also cause economic problems with biomass collection, transport, and storage. Since biomass is an especially reactive fuel, this has raised concerns over its safe handling and utilization. Fires, and sometimes explosions, are a risk during all stages of fuel production as well as during handling and utilization of the product. This paper presents a novel method for assessing ignition risk and provides a ranking of relative risk of ignition of biomass fuels. Tests within this method include physical and chemical properties of biomass, thermal analysis measurements, and the calculation procedure steps which were made using characteristic temperatures from thermogravimetry recordings. The results of thermogravimetry analysis were used for determination of tangent slope of the mass loss rate curves in devolatilization zone at considered heating rates for all tested samples. Linear interpolation of the data obtained by tangent slope analysis and used heating rates may provide unique straight line for each sample in the ignition testing. Thermogravimetry index of spontaneous ignition (TGspi) is obtained for all samples based on newly established formula. By varying gradient of linear dependence of self-heating coefficient against reference temperatures, mass and heat transfer limitations for various biomasses were discussed. The proposed method is accurate as well as relatively simple and quick, enabling determination of data necessary for design and application of appropriate measures to reduce fire and explosion hazard related to operation of biomass.}

Then platform leases products to customers with per-use price and service level. Since platform keeps the ownership of products, reverse logistics from platform to manufacturer is explored. In both cases, cooperative and noncooperative relationships between manufacturer and platform are discussed. The results show cooperation is better than non-cooperation in profit and service aspects. Total profit in non-cooperative case accounts for 3/4 of the total profit in cooperative case, among which manufacturer’s profit is 1/2 and platform’s profit is 1/4. We also investigate the coordination policy between manufacturer and platform in noncooperative case via the recycling subsidy and find that subsidy affects the wholesale price merely.

To understand how obtaining a medication abortion by mail with telemedicine counseling versus traditional in-clinic care impacted participants’ access to care.
Study design
We conducted a qualitative study with semi-structured telephone interviews with individuals who completed a medication abortion by mail through the TelAbortion study. We asked participants how they learned about telemedicine abortion, reasons for choosing it, what their alternative would have been, and about their experience. We transcribed, coded, and performed qualitative content analysis of the interviews and are presenting a subset of themes related to access to care when the restrictions on clinic dispensing of mifepristone are removed.
Results
We interviewed 45 people from January to July 2020. Direct-to-patient telemedicine abortion was more convenient and accessible than in-clinic abortion care when considering the burdens of travel, clinic availability, logistics, and cost that were associated with in-clinic abortion. Stigma led to a prioritization of privacy, and by going to a clinic, participants feared a loss of privacy whereas obtaining a medication abortion by mail made it easier to maintain confidentiality. Faced with these barriers, 13% of participants stated they would have continued their pregnancy if TelAbortion had not been an option. Participants found direct-to-patient telemedicine abortion to be acceptable and recommended it to others. Benefits of telemedicine were amplified during the COVID-19 pandemic due to concerns around infection exposure with in-clinic care.
Conclusion
Going to a clinic was a burden for participants, to the point where some would not have otherwise been able to get an abortion. Medication abortion by mail with telemedicine counseling was a highly acceptable alternative.
Implications
Medication abortion by mail can increase access to abortion with the added benefits of increased perceived privacy and decreased logistical burdens. Removing the in-person dispensing requirement for mifepristone would allow direct-to-patient telemedicine abortion to be implemented outside of a research setting without compromising the patient experience.}

The demand for practice-oriented training and education of customers is key to master upcoming challenges of warehousing facilities. This paper intents to develop a learning factory for services that promise 1) customers a better operation of their warehouses by correct use of services; 2) innovation opportunities for the service provider; and 3) further research opportunities between industry and academia. For this reason, in the first phase existing learning factories and services of an intralogistics company have been analyzed. Based on that service-learning factory concepts have been developed. In a third phase, a concept was chosen, further detailed and training contents were created. Based on this concept a prototype was built at the LEAD Factory of Graz University of Technology and tested.}

abstract = {This paper explores how the consideration of two important practical aspects related to transportation in the forestry industry, wood moisture content and seasonal limitations on the maximal truck's payload, may lead to savings in procurement costs. To this end, it proposes a multi-period mathematical formulation that decides on the location of potential stockyards and the quantities to move from suppliers to yards and from yards to factories at each period. The formulation accounts for the wood's weight loss achieved by natural drying at the stockyard. Drying depends on the number of periods that the wood stays in the yard but also on the particular weather conditions during the length of stay. The formulation also incorporates the dynamic seasonal restrictions on the allowed payload, in an attempt to mitigate their economic impact on transportation costs. Numerical results on randomly generated instances, as well as a real instance provided by a large pulp and paper producer in Québec, Canada, show that important improvements on the logistics’ costs can be achieved by explicitly considering these aspects.}

However, few empirical studies have investigated the benefits of BDA-AI in the supply chain integration process and its impact on environmental performance. To fill this gap, we extended the organizational information processing theory by integrating BDA-AI and positioning digital learning as a moderator of the green supply chain process. We developed a conceptual model to test a sample of data from 168 French hospitals using a partial least squares regression-based structural equation modeling method. The findings showed that the use of BDA-AI technologies has a significant effect on environmental process integration and green supply chain collaboration. The study also underlined that both environmental process integration and green supply chain collaboration have a significant impact on environmental performance. The results highlight the moderating role of green digital learning in the relationships between BDA-AI and green supply chain collaboration, a major finding that has not been highlighted in the extant literature. This article provides valuable insight for logistics/supply chain managers, helping them in mobilizing BDA-AI technologies for supporting green supply processes and enhancing environmental performance.}

abstract = {Many real-life systems in production and transportation logistics are complex, large-scale, and stochastic in nature. As a consequence, simheuristic approaches – which integrate simulation inside a metaheuristic framework – are becoming increasingly popular in the optimization and simulation communities. In a simheuristic algorithm, time-consuming simulation runs are required in order to: (i) obtain accurate results on the stochastic performance of solutions generated by the metaheuristic; and (ii) provide feedback that can be useful to better guide the metaheuristic search. If the underlying system is complex, discrete-event simulation might be needed, and then the simulation component could easily overrun the computational time of the metaheuristic component. Thus, for each new solution generated by the metaheuristic, several related questions arise: (i) should the simulation component be applied to that solution? – i.e., is that solution ‘promising’ enough to invest additional computational time on retrieving information about its performance in a stochastic environment?; and (ii) if so, how many simulation runs are needed in order to obtain useful information (i.e., statistics with a minimum level of accuracy)? This paper discusses these issues and proposes several concepts that allow to improve the efficiency (in terms of computational time) of simheuristic algorithms. A case study, based on a typical manufacturing system, is introduced. In order to illustrate and test different speeding-up techniques, the system is optimized by using a simheuristic that integrates a genetic algorithm with discrete-event simulation.}

abstract = {Purpose
To report three-decade changes of clinical characteristics, progress of treatments and risk factors associated for mortality and enucleation in patients with retinoblastoma in China.
Design
Retrospective cohort study
Methods
This multicenter study included 2552 patients diagnosed with retinoblastoma in 38 medical centers in 31 provinces in China from 1989 to 2017 with follow up data. Kendall's tau-b value was used to describe correlation coefficients between eras and clinical or demographic features. Hazard ratios and odds ratios were applied to measure risk factors.
Results
In this study, 324(13%) patients died of retinoblastoma and 1414(42%) eyes were removed. The 1-, 3-and 5- year disease-specific survival were 95%, 86% and 83%, respectively. Patients were diagnosed at a better stage by International Classification for Retinoblastoma over time (Kendall's tau-b value=-0.084, P<0.001). Pathological risk factors were also less observed in recent era. New conservative therapies were adopted and used in more patients. The eye removal rate gradually decreased (Kendall's tau-b value=-0.167, P<0.001). The disease-specific survival rate were 81%, 83% and 91% in the three eras. By multivariate cox regression, bilateral tumors and extraocular extension were risk factors for death. Among intraocular disease, group E indicated higher risk of mortality. By multivariate logistics regression, unilateral tumors, earlier era of diagnosis and extraocular extension were risk factors for eye salvage failure. Among intraocular retinoblastoma, groups D and E had higher risk of eye salvage failure.
Conclusions
Patients were diagnosed at earlier stage in recent era. Conservative therapies including IAC were increasingly used. The above changes may contribute to the decreasing enucleation rate. Although no significant difference was identified in the mortality of the three eras, a decreasing trend was shown.}

The global trend towards reducing the consumption of non-renewable energy has led to a significant reduction in the number of refineries in Europe. The purpose of this paper was to determine the trends in oil production and delivery and to assess the capacity of the oil transportation systems in Southern Europe. The allocation of crude oil production and delivery facilities in Southern European countries from 2005 to 2015 was analyzed using quantitative evaluation methodology. Changes in European crude oil production and delivery were highlighted. The transport infrastructure potential of oil supplies to consumers and oil production was studied. The study established that from 2013 to 2015, the oil supply to the refineries increased and generated additional stress on the transportation infrastructure. However, European infrastructure capacities had the necessary reserves to operate for the next several years without additional investment. In this paper, aggregate numbers for oil production and delivery are used. In addition, different refineries process different oil types. Nevertheless, the approach designed in this study can be applied to study the supply of certain oil types on the market.}

abstract = {Objectives
Large longitudinal cohort studies in infants are needed to understand oral microbiome maturation in relation to general health. The logistics of such studies are complex and costs involved high. Methods like home sampling by caretakers might be a solution to these issues. This study aimed to evaluate feasibility of home sampling by caretakers and to assess which oral niche provides the most reliable sample.
Methods
In this cross-sectional study 30 mothers and their infants aged 2–15 months participated. Swabs of the tongue, buccal mucosa, saliva, and dental plaque of the mother and the infant were collected by the mother after watching an instruction video. Thereafter, the trained researcher repeated the sample collection. Variations on the sampling protocol were listed. Bacterial DNA was quantified and microbial composition was assessed using 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing.
Results
None of the sampled niches appeared to be unfeasible based on interviews and observed variations on protocol. No significant differences in bacterial DNA concentration between operators (mother and researcher) were found. In infant's saliva, Shannon diversity of samples collected by the researcher was significantly higher than those collected by mothers (p = 0.0009) and the bacterial composition was influenced by variations on sampling protocol (p = 0.01).
Conclusions
Home sampling by caretakers is a feasible method for oral sample collection in infants and mothers. Oral samples collected by mothers resemble samples collected by a trained researcher, with the tongue sample being the most similar and saliva the least.
Clinical Significance
Home sampling can simplify longitudinal oral microbiota collection.}

Treatment burden is high, extending beyond time taken to perform routine daily treatments, with impact varying according to person-specific factors. Approaches to communication, support, evaluation of current treatments, service set-up, and treatment logistics (obtaining/administration) contribute to burden, offering scope for evaluation in clinical trials or service improvement.}

FASTCOLD project intends to provide fatigue design rules because until nowadays there is no reference about fatigue rules of bolted connections between thin-walled cold-formed steels, under diverse preloaded bolts, including snug tight condition. This work revealed differences between S-N curves suggested by Eurocode 3 and fatigue data obtained experimentally. In addition, preloaded bolts presented better fatigue resistance than snug tight bolts; the use of multiple bolted joints also improves the fatigue resistance due to the joint effect of bolts. Failed specimens showed that if the bolts preload and applied load level are respectively high and low enough, the specimen failures occurs along the gross cross-section, near the hole vicinity, instead of the typical net cross-section failure as occurred in single and multiple connections with snug tight bolts.}

abstract = {A non-stationary Gaussian random field model is developed based on a combination of the stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) approach and the classical deformation method. With the deformation method, a stationary field is defined on a domain which is deformed so that the field becomes non-stationary. We show that if the stationary field is a Matérn field defined as a solution to a fractional SPDE, the resulting non-stationary model can be represented as the solution to another fractional SPDE on the deformed domain. By defining the model in this way, the computational advantages of the SPDE approach can be combined with the deformation method’s more intuitive parameterization of non-stationarity. In particular it allows for independent control over the non-stationary practical correlation range and the variance, which has not been possible with previously proposed non-stationary SPDE models. The model is tested on spatial data of significant wave height, a characteristic of ocean surface conditions which is important when estimating the wear and risks associated with a planned journey of a ship. The model parameters are estimated to data from the north Atlantic using a maximum likelihood approach. The fitted model is used to compute wave height exceedance probabilities and the distribution of accumulated fatigue damage for ships traveling a popular shipping route. The model results agree well with the data, indicating that the model could be used for route optimization in naval logistics.}

The food supply chain faced severe difficulties, although its anti-cyclical nature allowed for greater resilience compared to other economic sectors. In this framework of ongoing uncertainty, it is important to understand the response of farms to the crisis, and their role in the sustainability of the post-pandemic food supply chain, even for future policy interventions in the short and medium term. The purpose of the paper is to investigate how diversification affected the response of farms to the Covid-19 crisis, and explore whether the changes required by the post-crisis scenario can produce opportunities for their activities. The study investigates a sample of fifteen farms in central Italy through semi-structured interviews, performing a lexicon-based text and sentiment analysis. The results highlight the importance of farm diversification in dealing with the Covid-19 crisis, and emphasise the role of diversified farms for the sustainability of the agri-food system. These results have interesting policy implications, particularly regarding support for the competitiveness of farms by improving sustainable logistics, electronic commerce and exchanges of knowledge and innovations among farmers; these measures should be taken into account to target the future agricultural, rural and food policies, at both national and local level.}

We build an inventory model for the system, design an iterative procedure using Mathematica to minimize the total cost and compare with the case that the buyers do not invest. The results show that the optimal cost of the case where the buyers invest is much lower than that of the case where the buyers do not invest. Moreover, the quantity of returnable containers the buyers receive and the replenishment frequency are both lower than the case that the buyers do not invest.}

Since sustainability projects are multi-disciplinary in the real world, ill-structured problem solving incorporated in semester-long team projects showed that students learned to work in diverse teams and understood team dynamics. These skills are expected to be transferred into students’ future engineering professional careers where they could demonstrate broader management, multidisciplinary, and communication skills, in addition to social, economic and environmental responsibilities.}

abstract = {Introduction
Though point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) is recognized as a useful diagnostic and prognostic intervention during cardiac arrest (CA), critics advise caution. The purpose of this survey study was to determine the barriers to POCUS during CA in the Emergency Department (ED).
Methods
Two survey instruments were distributed to emergency medicine (EM) attending and resident physicians at three academic centers in the South Florida. The surveys assessed demographics, experience, proficiency, attitudes and barriers. Descriptive and inferential statistics along with Item Response Theory Logistic Model and the Friedman Test with Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests were used to profile responses and rank barriers.
Results
206 EM physicians were invited to participate in the survey, and 187 (91%) responded. 59% of attending physicians and 47% of resident physicians reported that POCUS is performed in all their cases of CA. 5% of attending physicians and 0% of resident physicians reported never performing POCUS during CA. The top-ranked departmental barrier for attending physicians was “No structured curriculum to educate physicians on POCUS.” The top-ranked personal barriers were “I do not feel comfortable with my POCUS skills” and “I do not have sufficient time to dedicate to learning POCUS.” The top-ranked barriers for resident physicians were “Time to retrieve and operate the machine” and “Chaotic milieu.”
Conclusions
While our study demonstrates that most attending and resident physicians utilize POCUS in CA, barriers to high-quality implementation exist. Top attending physician barriers relate to POCUS education, while the top resident physician barriers relate to logistics and the machines. Interventions to overcome these barriers might lead to optimization of POCUS performance during CA in the ED.}

However, the uncertainty in customer’s demand, travel times or service times make it difficult to achieve 100% accuracy of these objectives. In the present study, one such issue has been considered as vehicle routing problem with time windows having stochastic demands and stochastic service times. To address this problem, a mathematical model has been developed which tries to maximize customer’s satisfaction and at the same time minimize total transportation cost. A modified ant colony system is proposed to solve the developed mathematical model. Numerical results on suitably modified datasets of Solomon benchmarks show that the proposed approach provides low cost solutions while maximizing the number of customers served and minimizing the penalties imposed due to late deliveries with little increase in total travelled distance. Certain penalties formulations provide several managerial insights to decision makers in the transportation industry.}

Nevertheless, a few of these novel solutions could represent radical game changers for the whole shipping business. Among the latter category, blockchain registers a particular role, given the possibility for smoothening administrative problems, providing new ways to achieve secure and frictionless transactions at a global level. Despite the importance of such innovation, most of the published studies have just focused on technical aspects, while the adoption and implementation processes are far to be clarified since there is not a clear understanding on the potential effects of blockchain on shipping and logistics actors, especially at local level. The proposed study aims at filling this gap, providing insights that might help to better understand: i) which are the actors that impact the most on the blockchain implementation (and related potential frictions), and ii) the difference among alternative initiatives currently present on the market. In order to achieve these twofold aim, the study uses a triangulation approach, mixing literature and media reports research with both web-based research on main initiative characteristics and expert opinions. The proposed study defines that regulators and public authorities might potentially represent the main barrier to the full implementation of the block chain technology, especially due to a missing market standard.}

The purpose of this research is to analyze factors that affect Brandenburg-State, DEU SMEs in their decision making process for an effective implementation of digital technologies in their daily business routine. The results of this study are based on a survey that was conducted in cooperation with fifty SMEs, which currently face problems in the areas of enterprise resource planning (ERP), CAD/CAM, automation, logistics and production/factory planning. Ten of these SMEs have decided to invest in digitalization measures and started the implementation process. Three of them were chosen for the case study to evaluate potential benefits, trade-offs and barriers hampering the implementation of digitalization technologies. These three companies are considered representative items, since their needs and measures investigated were identical to most of the companies of this survey. It was found that the overwhelming majority of the companies regard ERP implementation as their highest priority when investing in the most cost-effective technology.}

The COVID-19 diagnosis is difficult and ambiguous due to nonspecific symptoms. Further, data from Mexico arehospitable population-based without signs and symptoms information. Thus, this work aims to provide epidemiology information about the burden of COVID-19 in Mexican outpatients and to identify symptomatic COVID-19 profiles that could help in the early diagnosis of the disease.
Methods
From June to September, epidemiological, clinical, and demographic data of 482,413 individuals diagnosed by RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 in Salud Digna clinics were collected.
Results
We observed a 41% incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections with a mean age of 36 years and with young adults (20–40 years) being the most affected. Among occupations, delivery persons (OR 1.38) or informal traders (OR 1.33) had a higher risk of COVID-19. Moreover, 13% of SARS-CoV-2 infections were in presymptomatic patients. Finally, we identified three different symptomatic profiles (common, respiratory, and gastrointestinal) associated with COVID-19.
Conclusion
The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 was high among outpatients with a significant proportion of presymptomatic carriers, and thus it is necessary to increase testing and continue SARS-CoV-2 surveillance with a better description of signs and symptoms; in this regard, we identified three symptomatic profiles that could help in the diagnosis of COVID-19.}

In this context, and from the logistics point of view, ports are critical infrastructures not only because of their great vulnerability to such device phenomena, but also because of their key importance in global supply chains. We therefore need indications that will allow us to both determine a port’s resilience to the various challenges posed by climate change and take preventive actions to ensure the port can function correctly over time. This study presents a port resilience index (PRI), which, unlike existing indices, considers all stakeholders to determine the level of operational resilience of port processes. The index was validated in the external port of A Coruña (Galicia), chosen because of its especially adverse conditions and because in Spain, the effects of climate change are likely to be especially damaging. The results show that this port has an overall PRI of 52% and that its infrastructure and facilities and operational environment against the climate change challenge are especially sensitive. Analysis of the different factors of resilience allows port managers and policy makers to focus their actions on the factors that have the greatest impact of resilience. This should lead to better use of resources and more efficient contingency plans.}

The improvement of cold chain performance, data transparency, real-time temperature monitoring, and reporting is now enabled thanks to technological advancements. However, such technologies have not been massively adopted, adapted, and implemented.

In recent years, centralized management systems for fleets of heavy vehicles have been adopted in transportation networks for logistics and other applications. These vehicles can be instrumented and easily integrated with the existing fleet management systems to provide information that can be used for bridge health monitoring. In this study, a numerical investigation is carried out to evaluate the feasibility of an indirect bridge monitoring system considering responses from several vehicles under operational conditions. The proposed method uses the vertical acceleration responses from a fleet of vehicles passing over a healthy bridge to train a deep autoencoder model (DAE) for bridge damage sensitive features. It is shown that the error in signal reconstruction from the trained DAE is sensitive to damage, when considering the distribution or results from several separate vehicle-crossing events. The bridge damage is quantified with a damage index based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence that evaluates the change in the distributions of the reconstruction errors. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated for two numerical scenarios of vehicle populations, for different damage cases including the effect of operational uncertainties (road profile, measurement noise, and variability in vehicle properties). The proposed method is also evaluated for more realistic multi-span continuous bridge for different damage cases in the presence of random traffic. The result show that the proposed method can detect damage under operational conditions and that it has the potential to become a new tool for cost-effective bridge health monitoring.}

Purpose
Radiation oncologists need to have more than sound clinical and technical competencies. To optimize care for patients and advance all aspects of radiation oncology (RO), radiation oncologists must also be effective leaders. Embedding systematic leadership education into RO training programs is challenging. This study examined RO residents’ perspectives and preferences relating to leadership education. Such data informs the integration of universal leadership learning into RO training in Australian and New Zealand, and identifies priority areas to facilitate successful leadership development initiatives in RO training programs worldwide.
Methods and Materials
Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with 13 RO residents across eight Australian training departments and all stages of training. Data from transcriptions of taped interviews were coded by ≥ 2 researchers and collected to saturation. Qualitative thematic analysis was conducted employing an iterative inductive process to develop codes into themes and subthemes. Representative quotes were collated to illustrate subthemes.
Results
Four key themes related to leadership education were identified and labelled: (1) Recognition, credibility and value of education, (2) Logistics of formal learning, (3) Real-world opportunities: ‘seeing and doing’, and (4) One size does not fit all. Residents unanimously felt formal leadership education was important and that aspects of becoming a good leader could be learned. Organisational and cultural factors emerged as either barriers or facilitators to learning. There was strong support for interactive methods of learning, and role-modelling by senior colleagues was identified as having a major impact on junior learners.
Conclusions
This study offers insight into RO residents’ perspectives and preferences around their own leadership development. Findings have practical implications for the design of effective RO leadership programs and bring us one step closer to the ultimate goal of enhancing leadership capability for all RO professionals.}

In efforts to alleviate these problems in metropolitan cities, logistics companies plan to introduce a new Urban Air Mobility (UAM) service called air taxis. These are electric-powered vehicles that would be tested and operated in the forthcoming years by international transportation companies like Airbus, Uber, and Kitty Hawk. Since these flying taxis are an emerging mode of transportation, it is necessary to provide recommendations for initial design, implementation, and operation. This study proposes managerial insights for these upcoming UAM services by analyzing online customer reviews and conducting an internal assessment of helicopter operations. Helicopters are similar to air taxis in regards to their vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) operations, and therefore, customer reviews pertaining to the former can enable us to obtain insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the short-distance aviation service, in general. A four-stage sequential approach is used in this research, wherein online reviews are mined in Stage 1, analyzed using bigram and trigram models in Stage 2, 7S internal assessment is conducted for helicopter services in Stage 3, and managerial recommendations for air taxis are proposed in Stage 4. The insights obtained in this paper could assist any air taxi company in providing better customer service when they venture into the market.}

Foreign corporations possess the dynamic capabilities to improve the environment of developing countries through adoption of Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM) practices and collaborating with governments and domestic firms to further reduce the environmental footprint. In this context, three strands of GSCM literature have been critically analysed for this paper. Firstly, drivers and pressures for the adoption of GSCM were studied and three high priority drivers were selected for the conceptual model namely government regulations, customer demands and supplier performance. Secondly, the GSCM practices and their adoption benefits relevant to the developing countries were reviewed resulting in selection of four promising practices; eco-design, green purchasing, green manufacturing and reverse logistics. After that, the literature was reviewed on application of management theories in GSCM to testify the theoretical implications of the model. Finally, the conceptual model is presented that coincides with the systems, institutional and diffusion of innovation theories and purposes high degree of collaborations among foreign and domestic firms, governments, customers and suppliers. Hence, this study adds to the existing literature on GSCM adoption by identifying the base practices and drivers exclusive to the developing countries. It also purposes a collaboration mechanism in a novel conceptual framework to integrate the foreign and domestic firms under common agenda of improving the environment. In future, the theoretical model will be tested empirically to develop a practical model for industrial zones in developing countries.}

In this problem, first-level plants serve different demand patterns of scattered clients over a planning horizon via second-level facilities. In the first variant, second-level facilities can be supplied by only one of the plants (single assignment); whereas, in the second, they can be served by more than one of the first-level plants (multiple allocation). As the demands vary over time, the different operating settings for plants and facilities, and client assignments need to be sought in each period to serve demands at minimal installation and transportation costs. Since both problem variants arise naturally in the context of logistics systems, it is of interest to have solution methods at hand for practitioners and researchers. To provide such a tool, this work presents an efficient decomposition approach to solve the two problem variants. It relies on Benders decomposition reformulations combined with a greedy randomized adaptive search procedure and different Benders cut separation procedures. The devised solution framework outperformed CPLEX and its Benders built-in algorithm on solving two different challenging large-scale instance sets.}

In the COPTW, a certain number of team members are required to collect the associated reward from each node simultaneously and cooperatively. This requirement to have one or more team members simultaneously available at a vertex to collect the reward poses a challenging task. It means that while multiple paths need to be determined as in the team orienteering problem with time-windows (TOPTW), there is the additional requirement that certain paths must meet at some of the vertices. Exact methods are too slow for operational purposes and they are not able to handle large scale instances of the COPTW. In this paper, we address the problem of finding solutions to the COPTW in times that make the approach suitable for use in certain emergency response situations. This is achieved by developing new merit-based heuristics as elements of an Adaptive Large Neighbourhood Search (ALNS) algorithm. We validate the performance of this new approach through an extensive computational study. The computational results show that the proposed method is effective in obtaining high quality solutions in times that are suitable for operational purposes.}

Most practicing providers reported similar-to-increased caseloads (62%), new patients seeking services (67%), and appointment frequency (70%). Approximately 97% of providers used telemedicine, with 54% providing services mostly-to-exclusively via telemedicine.

In the CMCVRP, suppliers form a coalition to reduce their operating costs and improve service levels. Traditional approaches cannot coordinate the interests of all decision subjects in this process. To fill this gap, an integrated modeling method is proposed considering the objectives at both coalition and partner levels. In the model, two constraints are presented to guarantee the interests of all decision subjects. The constraint at the coalition level defines the acceptable region of solutions to ensure the efficiency of the coalition. And the constraint at the partner level limits the difference among partners' benefits to avoid excessive profit imbalance in the alliance. After that, a metaheuristic algorithm called the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-large neighborhood search is proposed to solve the model. Numerical experiments are conducted on thirty instances with three kinds of logistics networks, and the integrated method is compared with an existing approach (centralized method). The results show that the integrated method has a better performance to coordinate the benefits of all decision-makers when forming the coalition than the centralized method. Also, the impact of the network structures in the collaboration on the performance of the integrated method is investigated, and the conclusions can provide guidance for suppliers to choose their cooperators.}

abstract = {Summary
Background
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of a worldwide rapidly spreading illness, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Patients fed enterally and parenterally at home are exposed to the same risk of infection as the general population, but more prone to complications than others. Therefore the guidance for care-givers and care-takers of these patients is needed.
Methods
The literature search identified no relevant systematic reviews or studies on the subject. Therefore a panel of 21 experts from 13 home medical nutrition (HMN) centres in Poland was formed. Twenty-three key issues relevant to the management of SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 in the HMN settings were identified and discussed. Some statements diverge from the available nutrition, surgical or ICU guidelines, some are based on the best available experience. Each topic was discussed and assessed during two Delphi rounds subsequently. Statements were graded strong or weak based on the balance between benefit and harm, resource and cost implications, equity, and feasibility.
Results
the panel issued 23 statements, all of them were graded strong. Two scored 85.71% agreement, eleven 95.23%, and ten 100%. The topics were: infection control, enrolment to HMN, logistics and patient information.
Conclusions
the position paper present pragmatic statements for HMN to be implemented in places without existing protocols for SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. They represent the state of knowledge available at the moment and may change should new evidence occurs.}

abstract = {Collaborative Decision Support Systems (CDSSs) have been increasingly used to organize collaborative transport networks to develop sustainable freight transport. CDSSs involve two main components: a collaborative planning algorithm for matching transport orders to trucking capacities and an interactive front-end (e.g., websites and Email systems) for dispatching freight matches and communication among collaborators. The literature has mostly focused on developing and testing advanced algorithms using historical data. However, these studies test only one component and ignore the front-end that greatly affects the CDSS performance in daily practice. Overall, the literature lacks studies that evaluate and improve the CDSSs based on the feedback of end-users with a pilot test. Though poor data availability and quality are well-known issues in the logistics industry, no previous studies have discussed how to deal with the data issues in the real applications of CDSSs. To bridge these gaps, this study reports our experiences with testing an early version of a CDSS for automated freight matching in Denmark. The test results revealed some issues related to the ease of the CDSS usage and validity of the identified matches. A methodology is proposed to analyze the test results and to inspire ideas for improvement. The analyses showed that low data quality (e.g., missing values) is a significant barrier to developing effective front-end and valid matching. Due to the low data quality, automated matching can be more effective if carriers set their matching preferences through access to the CDSS. Besides, the front-end Email system should be developed in a way that reduces the number of emails, enables snap judgment, and visualizes the match details. Finally, some improvement suggestions are proposed and evaluated.}

Many countries are facing various levels up to severe energy crisis due to limited natural resources, coupled with the Covid-19 pandemic. This crisis can lead to the shutdown or restriction of many industrial units, limited energy access, exacerbating unemployment, simultaneous impacts on people's lives. The main reason for these problems is the increasing gap between energy supply and demand, logistics, financial issues, as well as ineffective strategic planning issues. Different countries have different visions, missions, and strategies for energy management. Integrated strategic management is requisite for managing global energy. This study aims to develop a strategic management framework that can be used as a methodology for policymakers to analyse, plan, implement, and evaluate the energy strategy globally. A conceptual research method that relies on examining the related literature is applied to develop the framework. The present study yielded two main observations: 1) The identification of key concepts to consider in designing the strategic management framework for global energy, and 2) A strategic management framework that integrates the scope, process, important components, and steps to manage global energy strategies. This framework would contribute to providing a standard procedure to manage energy strategies for policymakers at the global, regional, national, state, city, district, and sector levels.}

The experimental analysis of CCML shows that it exhibits weak or even lose chaotic behaviors in a large range of parameters. To enhance its chaotic performance, the new model changes the internal chaotic map of CCML from the logistics map to the tent map and introduces the module operations to limit the obtained value. The theoretical analysis and experimental results prove that the proposed model has a broad chaotic regime over an extensive range of system parameters, positive Lyapunov exponents, higher information entropies and lower mutual information values when compared to CCML, which are highly suitable for chaos-based image encryption. Moreover, this paper applies that model on a bit-level image encryption scheme. The algorithm consists of three main operations: the generation of secret keys, confusion and diffusion operations that can break the limitation of row and column. To confirm the novel algorithm's effectiveness and safety against the common types of attacks, many experiments are done and security analyses are discussed. It demonstrates the good chaos of the proposed model from the aspect of encryption performance.}

abstract = {Background
Community pharmacy is shifting its focus from traditional, product-focused roles to the provision of cognitive pharmaceutical services (CPS). Previous research has indicated that community pharmacists predominantly want to devote their capacity to CPS. Ideally, services provided also address users' needs. The general public's preferences regarding the services provided by community pharmacists are currently less understood.
Aim
This study investigates the general public's preferences and perceived importance of CPS versus convenience in community pharmacy practice.
Method
An online survey of 1.500 members of the Dutch Health Care Consumer Panel containing questions regarding preferences for CPS and convenience was distributed. Descriptive statistics and linear regression analysis were performed to investigate the relationship between preferences and participant characteristics.
Results
516 panel members completed all questions regarding preferences and importance of the availability of services. The majority preferred convenience (68.2%) and a smaller proportion preferred CPS (27.7%). However, participants considered it important from a societal viewpoint that CPS is provided (45.0%). Participants who preferred CPS over convenience were generally older (p < 0.001) and used more medicines (p < 0.001).
Conclusion
Convenience of community pharmacy services is most preferred by the general public. However, CPS is perceived as important, especially for elderly who use more medicines. Elderly patients who use more medicines more often rate CPS as more important than convenience. These findings suggest that community pharmacists should ensure that pharmacy logistics are organized efficiently before focusing on the provision of CPS.}

We examine the evidence base related to domains of procedural mastery, development of communication skills, and interprofessional team performance, with specific examples from the literature in which simulation has been used successfully in these domains in critical care training. We also review the data assessing the value of simulation in other areas highly relevant to critical care practice, including assessment of performance, integration of HCS in decision science, and critical care quality improvement, with attention to the areas of system support and high-risk, low-volume events in contemporary health-care systems. When possible, we report data evaluating effectiveness of HCS in critical care training based on high-level learning outcomes resulting from the training, rather than lower level outcomes such as learner confidence or posttest score immediately after training. Finally, obstacles to the implementation of HCS, such as cost and logistics, are examined and current and future strategies to evaluate best use of simulation in critical care training are discussed.}

However, UAV-based delivery services are limited by several binding factors, such as low battery capacities and short delivery range, which in turn require simultaneous use of a large fleet for commercial scale operations. In such cases, congestion in low-altitude air will inevitably arise. This paper investigates self-organized UAV traffic flow in low altitude 3D airspace, and formulates the user equilibrium condition as a set of partial differential equations. We propose a finite element scheme to numerically solve the traffic equilibrium and compute system performance. Two specific test scenarios for last-mile freight delivery systems are studied, including one with a conventional ground-based distribution facility, and the other with a novel concept of airborne fulfillment center. We evaluate the operational cost and energy consumption of these systems under a variety of system configurations. The results provide insights that could be useful for logistic carriers and policy makers to achieve efficiency and sustainability for last-mile delivery.}

abstract = {Background
Despite many serious and organized efforts worldwide, Tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the major public health concerns in many countries. India accounts for more than one quarter of global TB cases and deaths each year. India's National Tuberculosis Elimination Programme (NTEP) is the largest TB control program in the world, placing more than 100,000 patients on treatment every month. There have been so many revisions in the programme guidelines in the last 5 years. As we are gearing up for TB elimination in India, knowledge regarding the barriers is very crucial in the successful undertaking of these revised guidelines. Exploring perceptions of health care workers, both from the private and public sector will help to design appropriate strategies at the field level.
Objective
To explore the barriers and facilitators among health care workers in the implementation of revised NTEP guidelines in a selected district of central Kerala.
Methodology
This qualitative study was conducted among health care workers from all levels involved in the implementation of NTEP from private and public sector. Qualitative data was collected through Focus Group Discussions (FGD) and Key Informant Interviews using a topic guide till data saturation. All discussions were audio recorded with the consent of participants. Sociogram was plotted to confirm equal participation of interviewees. A total of 4 FGDs (2 from each sector) and 12 Key informant interviews (7 from public sector and 5 from private sector) were conducted after obtaining written consent from the participants.
Results
Overall awareness about revisions was found to be good. However, the study identified a “Gap between planners and implementers”. Frequent nature of revisions without understanding the practical difficulties in the field, additional job responsibilities, inadequate knowledge among grass root level workers/private practioners in small clinics and increased side effects were the major barriers identified. In addition to that, insufficient logistics, not enthusiastic in learning revisions, fear of losing patients, delay in communication, decreased compliance with new regimen, increased out of pocket expenditure and grey areas in the current guidelines were also adversely affecting the successful implementation At the same time, facilitators like positive attitude and commitment of health care workers, introduction of M-health technology, strong public private partnership, inclusion of costly investigations in the revised guidelines, good administrative support, financial assistance, innovative initiatives like Treatment Support Groups (TSGs) and concept of Family Directly Observed Treatment Short-Course increased the effectiveness of the programme to a large extent.
Conclusion
The study identified gaps in knowledge, attitude and practice of revised guidelines at the field level. Gap between ‘Planners and implementers could impede the successful implementation of TB Elimination programme and needs to be addressed.}

Our study captures the narratives of street vendors (seen as the ‘invisible’ entrepreneurs), working in markets across Delhi (India) and Phnom Penh (Cambodia) and analyzes the inventory logistics of products sold by them, thereby, reflecting the complex nature of an inter-twined, existential relationship between what's classified as ‘informal’ and ‘formal’ in urban economies. The mutual interdependence seen in the governing dynamics of economic exchange (for example, in selling commodities and services across identified markets in Phnom Penh and Delhi), argues for a need to inclusively study urban ecosystems while addressing the needs of street vendors. This paper does so by incorporating ethnographic methods with a specific reference to street vending (as a commercial urban activity). Further, we emphasize on an epistemic need to cross-fertilize thought(s) and method(s) across social science disciplines to produce more of such urban narratives, exploring the inter-twined relationship between the ‘informal’ and ‘formal’ aspects of urban ecosystems.}

GIS has been widely used in various applications and fields such as scientific investigations, resource management, asset management, environmental impact assessment, urban planning, cartography, criminology, history, sales, marketing, and logistics. Previously, 3D images were produced manually by using cardboard sheet. The advancement of 3D printing technology helps to accelerate the process of building 3D images effectively and one is able to produce more accurate representation of the real conditions. The most commonly used 3D printing approach in geospatial technology is fused deposition method (FDM). It uses filament type of material, which is usually made from acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) or polylactic acid (PLA). This article discusses in details the impact performances of both materials including the testing procedures and analysis of withstanding the impact. Based on the experimental data, it shows that ABS has greater impact performance that PLA, which makes it the preferred choice to be used by FDM in producing 3D images for the topographical data.}

abstract = {The poultry industry is one of the most important agricultural sectors, which constitutes a significant part of the per capita consumption of protein and meat. Integrating operations of poultry industry sections including production, distribution and consumption becomes vital. Although the proper poultry supply chain has been established and made plenty of benefits for a long time, the global outbreak of COVID-19 shows that operations under pandemic are still challenge for the poultry industry. In this paper, the impacts of pandemic on poultry industry is investigated by developing a multi-period multi-modal stochastic poultry supply chain. Two models are developed aiming to mitigate the negative effects of pandemic occurrence through product stocking policy. In the first model, distribution system is in accordance with a multi-component structure, while the second model allows direct connections between suppliers (farmers) and demanders (customers). In both models, poultry productions are negatively affected by COVID 19. Due to the complexity of the model, a hybrid solution approach based on Branch and Cut and Dynamic Programming is developed. To validate the performance of the proposed model and solution procedure, a case study on the broiler industry in the state of Mississippi is performed. The results show that storing poultry products in the pre-pandemic along with direct logistics during pandemic period can save the broiler supply chain cost up to 30%.}

abstract = {Background
Airport quarantine is required to reduce the risk of entry of travelers infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, it is challenging for both high accuracy and rapid turn-around time to coexist in testing; polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is time-consuming with high accuracy, while antigen testing is rapid with less accuracy. However, there are few data on the concordance between PCR and antigen testing.
Methods
Arrivals at three international airports in Japan between July 29 and September 30, 2020 were tested for SARS-CoV-2 using self-collected saliva by a screening strategy with initial chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA) followed by confirmatory nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) only for intermediate range antigen concentrations.
Results
Among the 95,457 persons entering Japan during the period, 88,924 (93.2%) were tested by CLEIA, and 0.29% (254/88,924) were found to be SARS-CoV-2 antigen positive (≥4.0 pg/mL). NAAT was required for confirmatory testing in 0.58% (513/88,924) with intermediate antigen concentrations (0.67–4.0 pg/mL) whereby the virus was detected in 6.6% (34/513). This two-step strategy reduced the utilization of NAAT to one out of every 173 test subjects. The estimated performance of this strategy did not show significant increase in false negatives as compared to performing NAAT in all subjects.
Conclusions
Point of care testing by quantitative CLEIA using self-collected saliva is less labor-intensive and yields results rapidly, thus suitable as an initial screening test. Reserving NAAT for CLEIA indeterminate cases may prevent compromising accuracy while significantly improving the logistics of administering mass-screening at large venues.}

abstract = {Recent advancements in sensing and robotic technologies facilitate the use of on-demand building service robots in the built environment. Multi-robot based systems have arguably more advantages when compared to fixed sensor-based and single-robot based systems. These task-oriented building service robots face several challenges, such as task-allocation and route-planning. Previous studies adopted approaches from other domains, such as outdoor logistics, and made application-specific assumptions. This study proposes a new methodology to optimize the task-allocation and route-planning for multiple indoor robots with multiple starts and destination depots where each robot begins and ends at the same depot (referred to as a fixed destination multi-depot multiple traveling salesman problem-fMmTSP). The performance of the proposed algorithm was compared with two existing outdoor-based algorithms. Results show that the proposed algorithm performs better in almost all the cases for the assumed network, which supports the need to develop algorithms specifically for indoor networks.}

The objectives are to (1) complete a brain death examination; (2) improve knowledge of pitfalls in brain death evaluation; (3) perform an apnea test correctly; and (4) understand the physiology of the oxygen diffusion method. Simulation scenarios also can include discussions with family members and the logistics of involving an organ-donation agency after the declaration of brain death.}

abstract = {The paleoclimate community has an interest in distributed subglacial bedrock sampling but, while capable drill systems do exist, they are often incompatible with Twin Otter logistics aircraft. To address this issue, a design built on the existing low footprint ice-sampler, the Rapid Access Isotope Drill (RAID), is investigated. The new device will retain key features of the parent system, but the ice drilling elements of the RAID will be replaced by a self-contained rotary-percussive core-drill capable of penetrating ice-consolidated and rocky terrain at and below the ice/rock interface. This new front-end will only be deployed once the interface itself has been attained, providing a pristine core sample from the underlying terrain. The proposed Percussive Rapid Access Isotope Drill (P-RAID) has been inspired by planetary drilling technologies to allow autonomous operations at the bottom of the hole. This paper details the development and testing of the proof-of-concept hardware. The mechanical and electrical design challenges encountered, and the results obtained from a series of prolonged cold chamber tests will be discussed, alongside lessons learned from initial testing in Antarctica.}

abstract = {Digitalization is changing industrial production and is offering huge potential for producing companies. One effect resulting from the increasing presence of information and communication technology in production is the increasing quantity and quality of production feedback data. However, only collecting large amounts of data of data does not lead to high logistical performance and low logistical costs. It is essential to acquire the right data with as little operating expenses as possible, to analyze the acquired data target-oriented and to present the results user-oriented, so that concrete actions can be derived. In practice, this is a challenge for producing companies. To demonstrate the opportunities in this field of action, a concept was developed at the Institute of Production Systems and Logistics (IFA) (Hannover, Germany) and, furthermore, implemented in the IFA learning factory. This paper starts with a short introduction of the IFA learning factory. After that, the paper presents the developed concept in detail, describing the PPC system, the data acquisition using RFID, an order processing support system using ESL and the (real-time) data analysis. In the end a summarizing conclusion is given underlining the importance of an integrated concept for data acquisition and utilization.}

abstract = {Digitalization has become a widely used term both in professional language and in scientific literature. It may be seen as a manifestation of technological progression which has been traditionally given a strong emphasis in theories of economic growth. The roots of digitalization are thus old, but the terminology has experienced rapid growth during the last decades. This paper focuses on the future prospects of digitalization in Finnish ports operating international trade and transports. In the case of transport, logistics, and ports the public sector has, mainly through ministries and offices focusing on economic development and employment, initiated numerous development programs with foresight ambitions. Commonly, these programs have a mid-range target setting referring to a 5–10-years time span into the future. The primary data is collected from two workshops (group interviews). As a result, the research identifies the main drivers and technologies that are significant for port digitalization. These are discussed in the context of three alternative scenarios: Digital supremacy; business as usual; and digital failure. These three scenarios are classified with SWOT (Strengths; Weaknesses; Opportunities; Threats) and PESTEL (Political; Economic; Social; Technological; Environmental; Legal) frameworks. It is assumed that the actualized future development will follow the mid-sections of the scenarios depending on global trends in politics and trade that impact the supply and demand that underlie the need for transport.}

abstract = {This study presents a novel method for the selection of sites for floating wind farms based on marine spatial optimization. After providing a review of the present state of the art, a tool based on geographic information systems is presented, consisting of three main stages and built in Python language. The first stage collects and analyses the information of the different regulatory bodies, marine spatial planning, maritime concessions and other sources. The second stage excludes not feasible sites for floating wind farms, based mostly on marine space use and on environmental constraints. The third stage characterises the available locations based on five major categories that are spatially dependent: metocean data, viability data, logistics, facilities, marine environment and techno-economic data. The proposed methodology is implemented at the Europe Atlantic coast, with specific reference to Portugal, Spain and France. These three countries together combine 3.362.408 km2 of the Atlantic Exclusive Economic Zone, where in only 0.22% of that area could host floating offshore wind turbines. While further detailed studies about locations and legislative considerations are required, the effort made has contributed to eliminate unsuitable areas and identify those where sustainability can be maximized.}

In this study, a mixed solution of tetradecane (TD) and lauryl alcohol (LA) was selected as the base liquid. In view of the low thermal conductivity of organic phase change materials, expanded graphite (EG) was added to TD-LA to improve the thermal conductivity. This study also developed a new type of cold storage equipment for vaccine, which can monitor the temperature of the vaccine in real time on the user's mobile phone. The cold storage equipment is equipped with a special cold storage box of vaccine. The vaccine reagent tube can be placed in the storage hole of the cold storage box. It can ensure that the cold storage agent in the cold storage box releases and transmits the cold quantity more evenly among the goods. Coupling the developed low temperature phase change material with the cold storage equipment can ensure that the vaccine is always in the required low temperature environment in the process of transportation for a long time to ensure its quality.}
