abstract = {Background/aim
The safety of amateur and professional boxing is a contentious issue. We hypothesised that advanced magnetic resonance imaging and neuropsychological testing could provide evidence of acute and early brain injury in amateur boxers.
Methods
We recruited 30 participants from a university amateur boxing club in a prospective cohort study. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and neuropsychological testing was performed at three time points: prior to starting training; within 48h following a first major competition to detect acute brain injury; and one year follow-up. A single MRI acquisition was made from control participants. Imaging analysis included cortical thickness measurements with Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTS) and FreeSurfer, voxel based morphometry (VBM), and Tract Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS). A computerized battery of neuropsychological tests was performed assessing attention, learning, memory and impulsivity.
Results
During the study period, one boxer developed seizures controlled with medication while another developed a chronic subdural hematoma requiring neurosurgical drainage. A total of 10 boxers contributed data at to the longitudinal assessment protocol. Reasons for withdrawal were: logistics (10), stopping boxing (7), withdrawal of consent (2), and development of a chronic subdural hematoma (1). No significant changes were detected using VBM, TBSS, cortical thickness measured with FreeSurfer or ANTS, either cross-sectionally at baseline, or longitudinally. Neuropsychological assessment of boxers found attention/concentration improved over time while planning and problem solving ability latency decreased after a bout but recovered after one year.
Conclusion
While this neuroimaging and neuropsychological assessment protocol could not detect any evidence of brain injury, one boxer developed seizures and another developed a chronic sub-dural haematoma.}

However, human excreta are considered unwanted waste throughout the world, creating humanitarian and environmental problems. In order to replace the nutrients removed from fields during crop harvesting, more fertilisers are manufactured, in processes contributing to environmental changes at global level. The limitation of human urine as a fertiliser is its low nutrient concentration compared with commercial fertilisers. This study developed a technique to increase the N concentration (from 0.6% to >6%) through urine dehydration to produce a dry fertiliser of monetary value and avoid the need for liquid disposal from the toilet. The technique is intended for a container-based sanitation system that collects, contains, treats and reduces the volume of urine within the container. In tests, fresh human urine was added at various intervals to wood ash at 35°C and 65°C, to alkalise and thus inhibit the enzyme urease from catalysing hydrolysis of urea to ammonia. Mass balance calculations demonstrated a 95% reduction during dehydration, while preserving up to 90% of the N. Such a system would greatly simplify the logistics and costs of storage, transportation and application of urine as a fertiliser. The truly innovative feature is the final product: a dry powder with 7.8% N, 2.5% P and 10.9% K by weight, i.e. equivalent to commercial fertiliser.}

Incorporation of MRI into image-based brachytherapy (IBBT) is limited by logistics, reimbursement, and workflow demands. Our goal is to determine if deformable image registration (DIR) using a preimplantation MRI is feasible to construct a high-risk target volume during IBBT.
Methods and Materials
From 2010 to 2013, 20 patients were treated with high-dose-rate IBBT for cervical cancer. A preimplantation MRI was fused to the planning CT, and DIR was performed using MIM v6.1. The gross tumor volume (GTV) and high-risk clinical target volume were contoured on the MRI (HR-CTV MRI), and a separate high-risk clinical target volume was made from the deformable image registration of the preimplantation MRI to the planning CT (HR-CTV′). The treated target volume from the planning CT without the DIR or fusion (HR-CTV BT) was compared with the HR-CTV′. The geometric means of the GTV, HR-CTV MRI, HR-CTV′, and HR-CTV BT were analyzed. Statistical analysis using Wilcoxon rank and analysis of variance were performed.
Results
There was a significant larger difference between the GTV and the HR-CTV MRI, HR-CTV′, and HR-CTV BT (p < 0.0001). There was also a significant difference between the HR-CTV MRI vs. the HR-CTV BT (p < 0.040). There was no significant difference between the HR-CTV MRI and HR-CTV′. DIR was advantageous in the setting of residual disease pre-IBBT.
Conclusions
DIR is feasible to define an HR-CTV for MRI-guided, CT IBBT. The HR-CTV MRI predicted a smaller treatment volume in comparison with the HR-CTV BT. DIR is limited by patient anatomy and is most beneficial in patients with gross disease.}

Further development of forest-based biorefineries entails addressing complexities and challenges related to biomass procurement, logistics, technologies, and sustainability. Numerous optimization models have been proposed for the economic and environmental design of biomass-to-bioenergy or biofuel supply chains. A few of them also maximized the job creation potential of the supply chain through the use of employment multipliers. The use of a total job creation indicator as the social optimization objective implies that all new jobs generate the same level of social benefit. In this paper, we quantify the potential social benefit of new forest-based biorefinery supply chains considering different impacts of new jobs based on their type and location. This social benefit is incorporated into a multi-objective mixed integer linear programming model that maximizes the social benefit, net present value and greenhouse gas emission saving potential of a forest-based biorefinery supply chain. The applicability of the model is illustrated through a case study in the interior region of British Columbia, Canada where different utilization paths for available forest and wood residues are investigated. The multi-objective optimization model is solved using a Pareto-generating method. The analysis of the generated set of Pareto-optimal solutions show a trade-off between the net present value of the supply chain and the other two investigated objectives. Moreover, there is a positive correlation between the potential to generate high impact jobs in the region and its potential to generate greenhouse gas emission savings.}

The method, called Dedicated Distance Proportional Allocation (DDPA), has been developed based on a literature review, discussions with logistics providers, and analysis. DDPA is designed to have low data processing requirements and be easy to explain to actors involved. Furthermore, it supports several levels of information availability, and accounts for any set of vehicle-limiting factors, as well as prepositioning/repositioning. DDPA has been evaluated in simulations with different levels of information availability, together with three existent allocation methods: the Equal profit method (EPM), the CEN EN16258:2011 standard and the Greenhouse gas (GHG) protocol. The simulations show that the GHG protocol under-allocates the total amount of emissions, on average. EPM and DDPA achieve equal relative savings, whereas for CEN EN16258:2011 and the GHG protocol, relative savings vary, on average. When DDPA is used with low level of information availability, an error is introduced which can be reduced by applying compensation factors. Since DDPA accepts low information availability, the Intelligent Products concept can be applied for computing and storing emissions allocations, at the time of unloading. The results from this study can be used for further development and implementation of consignment allocation methods. Furthermore, by combining DDPA with other environmental load approaches for other parts of a product’s life cycle, a complete life cycle assessment of the product’s environmental impact can be obtained.}

Considering bioenergy production in full perspective including technical, economic, and ecological aspects, biomass properties and quality are central factors when choosing the refining methods. These properties include moisture content, heating value, proximate analysis, ultimate analysis, bulk density, and alkali metal content. Local conditions for cultivation influence in the varieties of the plants for regional production, to reach sufficient levels of biomass crops in dry matter. Accessible refining processes for different plants vary geographically as consequence of containing various percentages of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, as well as alkali metals. As being raw material for higher value bio-based products such as fuels, chemicals, polymers, or materials, hemicellulose and lignin are also suitable for lower value use for combined heat and power applications. Biomass has optional exploitation pathways to be processed or utilized in combustion, gasification, pyrolysis, fermentation, hydrolysis, or anaerobic digestion to produce biofuels or energy. Some of the optional routes are in parallel and some in series, for example, when biomass is firstly processed into biofuel and then utilized as feed in energy production plant. Feedstock may be combined if preferable; also, processing technologies may be integrated and centralized, for example, in biorefineries. Biomass production chain, growing-logistics-conversion, should be built and designed with best available and locally suitable techniques and meeting the sustainability criteria. In the future, bio-based fuels are mainly based on waste and residues, foreseen to be integrated with nutrient recovery schemes.}

An efficient way is to collaborate with various stakeholders such as micro-/small-/medium-sized enterprises, factories, workshops, logistics service providers, public warehouse providers, and even individuals, forming a social media-based community. The vital factor to enable this way is the efficient real-time monitoring and dynamic dispatching of inter-enterprise production and transportation tasks. This work deals with the social manufacturing trend and proposes an radio frequency identification-enabled social manufacturing system (RFID-SMS) to realize the real-time monitoring and dispatching of inter-enterprise production and transportation tasks. Firstly, RFID devices are systematically deployed in each enterprise's job-shops and transportation vehicles to collect real-time production and transportation data. Then, these data is processed to monitor task progress and states, which is helpful to manage the inter-enterprise production processes. To deal with the unexpected disturbances, dynamic dispatching decisions for inter-enterprise production and transportation tasks are made by the manufacturer to win high flexibility and efficiency. Furthermore, a prototype is developed and a case is implemented in a printing machinery company, and the feasibility of the proposed system and models are evaluated by the practical industrial data from the company. It shows that RFID-SMS can improve the inter-enterprise production transparency under mass individualization.}

The high variability and the uncertainty of reverse flows require innovative logistic approaches. One recent option for increasing efficiency and responsiveness in waste collection services, boosted by new technological solutions for waste level monitoring, is to adopt a dynamic collection scheme, where the collection frequency is not established a priori (based on a fixed plan), but it is based on the actual filling levels of waste bins. This option can allow the service provider to plan the collection service following the actual demand, resulting in a more responsive service, while improving the logistic efficiency. This paper evaluates the implementation of dynamic scheduling schemes for the collection of WEEE. A hybrid simulation model has been developed in order to support researchers and practitioners in assessing quantitative impacts of adopting dynamic scheduling in WEEE collection. Three logistic alternatives (a fixed collection schedule scheme, a pure dynamic scheme and a mixed one) have been compared in a test case based on data of an Italian municipality; collection services for different types of WEEE (i.e. large appliances and small items) have been analyzed. Results show a promising performance of dynamic schedules compared to the fixed one, revealing, for the specific test case, how a mixed solution can combine the advantages of dynamic and fixed scheduling, gaining flexibility towards customer demand while improving truck resource utilization.}

Pre-hospital care is emergency medical care given to patients before arrival in hospital after activation of emergency medical services. It traditionally incorporated a breadth of care from bystander resuscitation to statutory emergency medical services treatment and transfer. New concepts of care including community paramedicine, novel roles such as emergency care practitioners, and physician delivered pre-hospital emergency medicine are re-defining the scope of pre-hospital care. For severely ill or injured patients, acting quickly in the pre-hospital period is crucial with decisions and interventions greatly affecting outcomes. The transfer of skills and procedures from hospital care to pre-hospital medicine enables early advanced care across a range of disciplines. The variety of possible pathologies, challenges of environmental factors, and hazardous situations requires management that is tailored to the patient's clinical need and setting. Pre-hospital clinicians should be generalists with a broad understanding of medical, surgical, and trauma pathologies, who will often work from locally developed standard operating procedures, but who are able to revert to core principles. Pre-hospital emergency medicine consists of not only clinical care, but also logistics, rescue competencies, and scene management skills (especially in major incidents, which have their own set of management principles). Traditionally, research into the hyper-acute phase (the first hour) of disease has been difficult, largely because physicians are rarely present and issues of consent, transport expediency, and resourcing of research. However, the pre-hospital phase is acknowledged as a crucial period, when irreversible pathology and secondary injury to neuronal and cardiac tissue can be prevented. The development of pre-hospital emergency medicine into a sub-specialty in its own right should bring focus to this period of care.}

Unfortunately, guidelines supporting comprehensive analysis, especially concerning the evaluation of environmental and social performance of decision alternatives, are missing. This hinders the advancements in corporate sustainability. Questions arise on how to measure and balance respective indicators with traditional economic objectives. To fill this void, this research sets out to develop an intuitive and holistic planning framework for advancing sustainability along supply chains. In a first step, we identify sustainability issues and indicators as well as decision-support methods by scrutinizing literature on sustainable supply chain management. Based on this, we develop a planning framework that supports executives in evaluating and deciding upon corporate sustainability initiatives. The framework comprises three consecutive phases of planning: ‘Problem definition’, ‘Assessment of alternatives’, and ‘Decision analysis’. For each phase we propose appropriate tools distinguishing concepts of sustainable supply chain management (e.g. Sustainable Logistics and Sustainable Manufacturing), methods for measuring the ecological and social efficiency of decision alternatives, and quantitative decision-support techniques able to balance trade-offs between the three dimensions of the triple bottom line. As a result, this article presents a framework for guiding corporate decision-processes. From the academic angle, the article contributes to the research field by providing a structured integration of concepts and methods utilizable in the pursuit of ecological and social improvements along the value chain.}

To establish a picture of clinical education models within radiography programmes across Europe by surveying higher education institutions registered as affiliate members of the European Federation of Radiography Societies (EFRS).
Method
An online survey was developed to ascertain data on: practical training, supervisory arrangements, placement logistics, quality assurance processes, and the assessment of clinical competencies. Responses were identifiable in terms of educational institution and country. All educational institutions who were affiliate members at the time of the study were invited to participate (n = 46). Descriptive and thematic analyses are reported.
Results
A response rate of 82.6% (n = 38) was achieved from educational institutions representing 21 countries. Over half of responding institutions (n = 21) allocated in excess of 60 European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS) credits to practical training. In nearly three-quarters of clinical placements there was a dedicated clinical practice supervisor in place; two-thirds of these were employed directly by the hospital. Clinical practice supervisors were typically state registered radiographers, who had a number of years of clinical experience and had received specific training for the role. Typical responsibilities included monitoring student progress, providing feedback and completing paperwork, this did however vary between respondents. In almost all institutions there were support systems in place for clinical placement supervisors within their roles.
Conclusions
Similarities exist in the provision of clinical radiography education across Europe. Clinical placements are a core component of radiography education and are supported by experienced clinical practice supervisors. Mechanisms are in place for the selection, training and support of clinical practice supervisors. Professional societies should work collaboratively to establish guidelines for effective clinical placements.}

First, the system for the Least Energy Demand Method will be explained. The basic idea of this calculation is the comparison and evaluation of energy efficiency based on the ratio of the theoretically required energy consumption to the measured energy consumption. Using these values as well as further derived indicators for energy efficiency, the main energy consumers within the field of electric drives production are identified. Subsequently, these processes are analysed and optimized to achieve major energy saving instructions. From an energy point of view during the stator production chain, especially the impregnation process and the joining process have to be optimized as, in the here presented measurements, the impregnation process amounts to more than 80 % of the cumulated energy demands. Moreover, the process of joining insulated copper wires of the stator windings to corresponding cables shoes is optimized, as it shows strong energy saving potentials. Additionally, the power consumption values within the state of the art joining process are varying strongly thus leading to higher load peaks within the production line, which have to be reduced. Regarding energy efficiency within the manufacturing of permanent magnet synchronous rotors, the process of magnet assembly also has to be evaluated. It can be subdivided into magnet manufacturing, logistics, magnetization and assembly. A major part of the energy used in this process is accounted for by means of transportation, especially when considering that magnetized magnets need larger packaging volumes and weights due to the ferromagnetic shielding and spacers to support handling of the magnet bodies. Thus, the energy efficiency can be increased considerably by shifting the magnetization step directly to right before the assembly step. In addition, energy can be saved by optimizing the magnetization process according to the magnetization strategy and the interaction of all process parameters, such as capacity of the magnetizer, inductivity and size of the magnetizing coil, magnet size, material and coating.}

abstract = {An important mandate when imaging pediatric patients is the reduction of radiation exposure to the lowest possible level consistent with good quality diagnostic imaging, so individual selection of radiopharmaceutical dosage and imaging technique is essential. Although the logistics of image acquisition and the approach to interpretation mirror the more common use in adults, the challenges of imaging young children typically require greater attention to patient preparation, positioning, and supervision during imaging, with the use of parental or family engagement in the procedure, gentle restraint, and occasionally the need for sedation. Because the normal bone scan appearance varies dramatically with age as osseous structures mature, it is critical that the interpreting physician be well versed in the range of normal variability at each developmental stage. Although routinely employed in the evaluation of malignancy, radionuclide bone imaging in children is used for a much wider range of benign disorders than it is typical in adults. In many pediatric nuclear medicine departments, the evaluation of benign bone disorders represents most imaging procedures. Common indications include the evaluation of sports injuries, osteomyelitis, trauma, including suspected child abuse, growth disorders, such as mandibular condyle asymmetry, and noninfectious processes such as Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Both planar scintigraphy and SPECT imaging are widely employed, although the SPECT acquisition time presents a barrier in some age groups, making shorter planar spot views desirable when feasible. PET bone imaging with 18F-sodium fluoride has been shown useful in a number of pediatric disorders, but may present issues in young children, as it can require the use of sedation. Despite this challenge, the higher resolution and resulting better anatomical depiction of bone anatomy by PET techniques can be very valuable in evaluating small structures, and current experience suggests a large future role for fluoride PET imaging.}

Methods
A survey instrument was constructed, which queried respondents on professional experience, practice environment, pIVC use, and reasons for not recommending pIVC when applicable. The survey was electronically distributed to members of the Society of Urologic Oncology over an 8-week period. Survey software was used for analysis.
Results
The survey response rate was 22% (158 of 722). Half of the respondents were in practice for ≤10 years, while 90% performed ≤10 RNU cases annually. Of the 144 urologists regularly performing RNU, only 51% reported administering pIVC, including 22 exclusively in patients with a prior history of bladder cancer. One-third administered pIVC intraoperatively, whereas the remainder instilled pIVC at ≤3 (7%), 4 to 7 (37%), 8 to 14 (20%), and>14 (3%) days postoperatively. Almost all urologists noted giving a single instillation of pIVC. Agents included mitomycin-C (88%), thiotepa (7%), doxorubicin (3%), epirubicin (1%), and BCG (1%). Among respondents who did not administer pIVC, the most common reasons cited included lack of data supporting use (44%), personal preference (19%), and office infrastructure (17%).
Conclusion
Only 51% of urologic oncologists report using pIVC in patients undergoing RNU. Reasons underlying this underutilization are multifactorial, thereby underscoring the need for continued dissemination of existing data and additional studies to support its benefits.

abstract = {The aim of the Land Administration Project (LAP) policy reform for supporting the establishment of the Customary Land Secretariats (CLSs) is to formalise and strengthen customary land administration and management within the context of decentralised land administration. With the prospects of the CLSs becoming the legal local land administrative units, the paper assessed how traditional land governance institutions may have contributed to the decentralisation of land administration in Ghana. The research used case study strategy within the qualitative research paradigm and un-structured questionnaires were used to collect data. The analyses show that, simple land registries exist with traditional local governance institutions through the CLSs. The maintenance and effectiveness of this however depends on continuous improvement of records keeping, quality of office personnel and suitable office accommodation. This should be devoid of local power struggles among current and successive chiefs. Also, collaboration with public land sector agencies especially in areas of sharing information on rights, uses, disputes and preparation of planning layouts is paramount. These registries are mere extension of the state land administration apparatus as service units under the deconcentration of land administration powers. The paper concludes that the current policy focus on strengthening decentralised land administration through the CLSs may fail if attention is not given to the maintenance of the local registries. Revenue generation capacities of the CLSs need to be enhanced in order for them to recruit and maintain quality office staff, and acquire technical logistics. Decentralising land administration to the CLSs under the deconcentration of powers should be maintained in the interim because of the teething problems identified with this current system.}

abstract = {Recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) require a large investment in construction, equipment and energy. To ensure sufficient return on these investments, RAS operations must be managed meticulously. RAS managers must consider numerous factors related to the biological traits of the fish, logistics, seasonal market demand, and livestock management. RAS that specialize in ornamental fish are faced with particular challenges in that a given species of fish may actually yield several different "products," distinguished, for example, by color, which can be sold at different sizes for different prices. RAS managers need to consider the market prices of different-sized fish in the light of their production costs (cost of food and space, dependent on time in the system). The current study aims to develop an optimization model for the operations management of RAS specializing in ornamental fish. The objective of the model is to maximize annual profit. The methods used include: a general simulation model, built in Arena 11.0®, that seeks to mimic the studied system; an optimization procedure based on response surface methodology (RSM), including design of simulation experiments, stepwise regression (in SPSS® 11.0), and a nonlinear objective function and constraints solved with MATLAB®. The method is demonstrated in a case study—a RAS on Kibbutz Hazorea, Israel, raising ornamental koi fish (Cyprinus carpio).}

Urinary concentration of mono-butyl phthalate (MBP), mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP), Mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP), Mono-methyl phthalate (MMP), Mono (2-ethyl-5-exohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP), and mono (2-ethyl-5hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP) metabolites were determined. The association of these metabolites with obesity and cardiometabolic risk factors was examined using student t-test, linear and logistics regression tests. Of the 242 participants studied, 140 (57.9%) were girls and 102 (42.1%) were boys. The mean (SD) age of the population was 11.34 (2.55) years and no significant difference existed in terms of age (p-value = 0.374). MBzP, MBP, MMP were observed in urine samples of all subjects, and MEHP, MEOHP, and MEHHP were observed in 99.6, 95.87, and 96.28% of the subjects, respectively. Of the total participants, 15.2% (n = 37) were obese and 37.7% (n = 92) were overweight. According to the logistic regression analysis, except MEOHP, all other pollutants were significantly associated with obesity (OR adjusted >1, p-value ≤ 0.002). A significant association existed between MBP and elevated blood pressure [OR crude in tertile3 = 4.87 (CI: 1.02–23.32), p-value = 0.024]. MBzP and MEHP were significantly associated with obesity, elevated levels of triglyceride and blood pressure.

abstract = {Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa and in 2012 was suffering some of the lowest vaccination rates in the World. A combination of factors had resulted in a dysfunctional immunization cold chain and supply chain. Recognizing that the number of unimmunized children contributed to high levels of under-5-mortality, and that health MDGs would not be attained, Minister of State for Health Mohammed Pate launched a vaccines transformation project in 2013. In partnership with BMGF, GAVI, UNICEF, WHO, other donors and implementing partners the transformation journey has so far taken three years and achieved impressive results. It has though faced challenges along the way and with the financial burden of GAVI graduation facing Nigeria, the economic downturn and the decentralized funding of health services, the results are far from sustained. This paper documents the work undertaken at the Federal level and then highlights specific work undertaken in partnership with Lagos State Government. It identifies the importance of taking an end to end approach and looking at the root causes of weak system performance. The strategy combined simple innovations in how data was captured, recorded and used to drive decision making. It included a comprehensive and systematic approach to cold chain procurement, installation and maintenance with a shift to a culture of active cold chain maintenance that is performing with higher levels of uptime. It also included supply chain redesign at both the Federal and State level. Finally, it involved an institutional transformation at the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) to establish a data driven Department of Logistics and Health Commodities (DLHC) to manage the many challenges in immunizing 7.5 million children annually. While results have been impressive, there have been many challenges and lessons learned on the way. As Nigeria gets ready for its graduation from GAVI, a robust agile performing cold chain and supply chain will be essential for the good health of Nigeria’s children and its economy. The necessary transformation journey has only just begun.}

abstract = {Time-temperature control is a critical issue in food logistics and the effective tracking of cold chain conditions is one of the main points to be addressed. There is a need for development and standardization of labels with a flexible range of temperature sensitivity, expressed by activation energy and of response time. Time Temperature Integrators (TTI) are inexpensive, active smart labels that show the time-temperature history of the food product to which they are attached. Enzymatic TTIs are based on a pH decrease resulting from the temperature-dependent enzymatic hydrolysis of a lipid substrate. The colour change of a pH indicator in the solution can be visually assessed or measured instrumentally. The considerations that allow for targeted design of the response characteristics of this type of TTI are the concentration of the enzyme and choice of substrate. This study applied predictive models for growth of Vibrio parahaemolyticus (VP) and Vibrio vulnificus (VV) growth in oysters and used the information from that work to design enzymatic TTI smart labels with response kinetics suitable for indicating the growth potential of Vibrio spp. during the transportation of oysters from harvest to storage for further distribution and sale. The results of the study indicated that the VV- and VP-TTIs developed in this study may be an effective and cost-effective tool for validating improved handling and cooling procedures and for monitoring the transport of oysters.}

The aims are to minimize the average tardiness to deliver products, total cost and transportation cost. In addition the developed model specifies the optimal locations for a new distribution center (DC), collection center and disposal center as well as the optimal allocation of customer zones to each DC. This model is solved in three stages: (1) a Jackson network determines the queuing parameters, (2) an Lp-metric approach makes the multi-objectives into a single objective, and (3) an efficient Lagrangian relaxation based on a sub-gradient approach solves the presented model. Additionally, a real case study is shown in details to depict the application of the presented model. At the end, the sensitivity analyses are carried out to check the optimal objectives by changing the important parameters.}

Within e-waste, the life cycle of the mobile phone product system is particularly important because of: (1) the increasing quantities of mobile phones in this waste flow; and (2) the sustainability challenges associated with the emerging economies of reuse, refurbishment, and export of used mobile phones. This study examined the possibilities of closing the material flow loop in the global mobile phone product system (GMPPS) while addressing the broad sustainability challenges linked to recovery of materials. This was done using an adapted system dynamics modeling approach to investigate the dominant paths and drivers for closing the metal flow loop through the concept of eco-cycle. Two indicators were chosen to define the closed loop system: loop leakage and loop efficiency. Sensitivity analysis of selected parameters was used to identify potential drivers for closing the metal flow loop. The modeling work indicated leverage for management strategies aimed at closing the loop in: (i) collection systems for used phones, (ii) mobile phone use time, and (ii) informal recycling in developing countries. By analyzing the dominant parameters, an eco-cycle scenario that could promote a closed loop system by decreasing pressures on virgin materials was formulated. Improved policy support and product service systems could synchronize growth between upstream producers and end-of-life organizations and help achieve circular production and consumption in the GMPPS.}

Impact assessment is studied evaluating: carbon footprint, ecological footprint, water footprint, acidification, eutrophication, ozone layer depletion, photochemical oxidation. The new approach proposed in this paper leads to the obtainment of a complete analysis of the impact of aged vinegar, which can help a small farm choose more sustainable production methods, also optimizing logistics. This is the scientific added value of the work. The results show that aged vinegar has a carbon footprint comprised between 1.94 and 2.54 kg CO2/l. The Ecological footprint of aged vinegar varies between 9.83 and 13.23 g m2/kg. The Water Footprint of aged vinegar varies between 1332 and 1892 l/l. The water scarcity weighted water footprint methods available in the software SimaPro 8 give different results depending on their assumptions.

References are made to FedEx and UPS networks within their U.S. headquarter region and in China to note differences in political economic contexts and China’s adaptation of developed world models. The theoretical framework includes global production networks strategically coupled by transport logistics linked to aerotropolis type development. Data comes from government aviation and transportation sources, research analyses, corporate and industry reports, and interviews with Chinese officials. Focus falls particularly on Zhengzhou, capital of Henan Province in central China and the country’s first airport-centered economic zone. The conclusion finds that Chinese hub cities more closely correspond to major manufacturing and population centers and central policy directives for development dispersion.}

We describe the methodology used to construct the framework, which entails a multi-disciplinary approach. An original land-network problem merges localized and large-scaled decisions as land-use allocation and location-allocation problems in an agro-food network. A linear programming model optimizes infrastructure, agriculture, and logistics costs and also balances carbon emissions within the agro-food ecosystem. A regional potato supply chain illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed model. Findings show the interdependency between infrastructure, production, distribution, and environmental resources. Results highlight the consequences of unbalanced planning focused solely on cost efficiency. In conclusion we identify enabling conditions, drivers and metrics for the design of cost effective and carbon balanced agro-food ecosystems.}

This paper reviews pharmacy and formulation support provided to a consecutive series of investigator-led clinical studies supported by CRN:Children. Case studies are included to describe some of the unique pharmaceutical challenges encountered. 44 trials were reviewed and a total of 103 products were required to support these clinical trials. UK authorised products were suitable for use for 62 of these 103 products. In the remaining 41 cases, 4 could be sourced as an authorised product within the European Union and the remaining 37 required bespoke manufacture. Bespoke manufacture of an investigational drug or placebo is costly. Typical costs for the initial development and testing of a bespoke investigational drug or placebo were in the range of £30,000–100,000 per product. The estimated cost for 19 out of 45 trials was available; in summary, the costs on a per patient per day of therapy basis ranged from under £1 to almost £600; short studies involving multiple agents are obviously the most expensive. This range is dependent upon the need for bespoke manufacture and also the number of participants within the trial. The arrangements for investigational drug supply can greatly affect the study design, regulatory requirements, trial logistics, as well as the total cost of research. As investigational product related activities are often costly, necessitating months of advance planning, it is imperative that specialist inputs are sought from the very start of the study design and planning process.}

An e-learning framework incorporating different stages of learning and usage of learning resources was first developed as a guide. Then, a sample of learning resources that came with 100 commonly used textbooks in the disciplines of logistics/supply chain management and information systems were classified using the framework. To corroborate the classification, cluster analysis was also conducted to identify major clusters of learning resources along two dimensions - complexity of content and ease of use. The findings show that most of the sampled textbook learning resources are only suitable for low-order to mid-order learning according to the revised Bloom's taxonomy. The majority of the resources investigated lack the sophistication and complexity to support high-order learning that involves a great deal of interaction and collaboration among learners and facilitators on e-learning platforms. In other words, existing textbook learning resources might contribute well to self-regulated low-order and mid-order e-learning involving basic to intermediate cognitive processes, such as remembering, understanding, applying and analysing. They are generally ill-designed to facilitate high-order e-learning involving advanced cognitive processes, such as evaluating and creating, which require extensive interaction and collaboration among learners and facilitators in an e-learning environment.}

Material was monitored for several months in temporary storage to assess changes in biomass quality (moisture, ash and energy content). Internal pile temperatures increased due to biological activity and conditions within a pile quickly differentiated based on location (shell, core, top, and side). Mean moisture content increased from 42 to 47% (mass fraction) between harvest and delivery of the chips, but ranged between 37 and over 60% over the next three months depending on pile location with the shell generally drier than the core. Mean ash content increased 1 to 2% points (mass fraction) between harvesting, reloading and delivery to the trial location, but became more variable during storage. Higher heating values (HHV) were stable between 18.6 and 19.0 MJ kg−1 over the six months, but lower heating values (LHV) ranged between 8.6 and 11.7 MJ kg−1 and mirrored changes in moisture content. There was minimal change in chip quality over two months, but quality became more variable over longer time periods. This period could be extended, and negative effects on chip quality could be mitigated, by improving storage methods, blending different types of chips, or employing pretreatments.}

abstract = {Objective
To describe an innovative community pharmacy–based pilot program using technology to support transitions of care for patients living in rural areas.
Setting
This service occurred through a partnership between 1 independent community pharmacy organization with 5 locations in Ohio and Indiana and one 92-bed general medical and surgical county hospital during May 2014 to May 2015.
Practice description and innovation
Community pharmacists worked with patients immediately following discharge to reconcile their medications and make recommendations to optimize therapy. The pharmacy packaged their new medication regimen in clear, individual dose adherence packaging. Medications were delivered by a staff driver to the patient's home within 72 hours of discharge. Patients consulted with the pharmacist by videoconference using a computer tablet device. Patients received telephone follow-up shortly before their medication supply was to run out, and additionally as needed on an individual basis.
Evaluation
Self-reported hospital readmissions were collected at 30 and 180 days after enrollment. Patient satisfaction data were also collected at 30 and 180 days using a tool modified from the 5-item Transition Measure (15-item Care Transitions Measure).
Results
Eighteen patients participated in the evaluation of the pilot. Three patients were readmitted within 30 days (17%), and 2 additional patients were readmitted within 180 days (11%). Patient satisfaction results were positive overall. Lessons learned relate to establishing partnerships, logistics, and patient engagement. These lessons will assist future community pharmacies in implementing a transition of care service.
Conclusion
This pharmacist care model may offer a solution to increase access to pharmacy services for patients in rural areas during a critical transition in care.}

Convincing people to drive more fuel-efficiently (“eco-driving”) can contribute substantially to this goal and is often an integral part of policy initiatives. However, there is a lack of scientific studies on the effects of individual monetary and non-monetary incentives for eco-driving, especially in organizational settings and with regards to demonstrating causality, e.g., by using controlled experiments. We address this gap with a six months long controlled natural field experiment and introduce a monetary and a non-monetary reward for eco-driving to drivers of light commercial vehicles in different branches of a logistics company. Our results show an average reduction of fuel consumption of 5% due to a tangible non-monetary reward and suggest only a small reduction of the average fuel consumption in the equivalent monetary reward treatment. We find indications that more emphasis on the fun of achieving a higher fuel efficiency, a more emotional response to non-monetary incentives, and a higher frequency of thinking and talking about non-monetary incentives might play a role in the stronger effect of the tangible non-monetary reward. Policy implications for private and public actors are discussed.}

When we combine the stages of the order fulfillment cycle with the buyer's information sharing factors, a more complete view of the buyer-supplier exchange becomes useful for performance evaluation of both the suppliers and the buyers. Using operational data obtained from a large telecommunications firm, which placed strategic importance on measuring the performance in the purchase order fulfillment cycle stages, this study offers a new context for supplier evaluation. This context also conceptualizes several on-time delivery disruption scenarios as supplier delivery performance risk, and investigates the sensitivity of both the buyer's information sharing and the suppliers’ performance capabilities to on-time delivery disruptions. We evaluate supplier performance and segment suppliers through recourse to chance-constrained data envelopment analysis at high and low discriminatory power levels. Our results show that there are statistically significant relationships between the dimensions of information sharing by the buying firm and the classification of supplier firms at varying levels of on-time delivery performance risk. We also identify robust suppliers demonstrating the capability to remain efficient across disruption levels despite poor buyer performance on information sharing factors, and provide managerial insights on buyer-supplier exchange.}

Drawing on the street-level bureaucracy theory, we explored how and why frontline providers (FLP) actions on their own and in interaction with health system factors shape Ghana's community-based PHC implementation to the disadvantage of women and children accessing and using health services. This was a qualitative study conducted in 4 communities drawn from rural and urban districts of the Upper West region. Data were collected from 8 focus group discussions with community informants, 73 in-depth interviews with clients, 13 in-depth interviews with district health managers and FLP, and observations. Data were recorded, transcribed and coded deductively and inductively for themes with the aid of Nvivo 11 software. Findings showed that apart from FLP frequent lateness to, and absenteeism from work, that affected care seeking for children, their exercise of discretionary power in determining children who deserve care over others had ripple effects: families experienced financial hardships in seeking alternative care for children, and avoided that by managing symptoms with care provided in non-traditional spaces. FLP adverse behaviours were driven by weak implementation structures embedded in the district health systems. Basic obstetric facilities such as labour room, infusion stand, and beds for deliveries, detention and palpation were lacking prompting FLP to cope by conducting deliveries using a patchwork of improvised delivery methods which worked out to encourage unassisted home deliveries. Perceived poor conditions of service weakened FLP commitment to quality maternal and child care delivery. Findings suggest the need for strategies to induce behaviour change in FLP, strengthen district administrative structures, and improve on the supply chain and logistics system to address gaps in CHPS maternal and child care delivery.}

The success of EVs relies on technologies to extend their driving range, which can be achieved by the good deployment of EV recharging stations. This paper considers a special EV network composed of fixed routes for an EV fleet, where each EV moves along its own cyclic tour of depots. By setting up a recharging station on a depot, an EV can recharge its battery for no longer than a pre-specified duration constraint. We seek an optimal deployment of recharging stations and an optimal recharging schedule for each EV such that all EVs can continue their tours in the planning horizon with minimum total costs. To solve this difficult location problem, we first propose a mixed integer program (MIP) formulation and then derive four new valid inequalities to shorten the solution time. Eight MIP models, which were created by adding different combinations of the four valid inequalities to the basic model, have been implemented to test their individual effectiveness and synergy over twelve randomly generated EV networks. Valuable managerial insights into the usage of valid inequalities and the relations between the battery capacity and the total costs, number of recharging facilities to be installed, and running time are analyzed.}

Distal half leg complex wounds are usually a formidable problem that necessitates either local or free flap coverage. The aim of this study was to compare cost billing charges in free Gracilis flap (fGF) and local fasciocutaneous perforator flap (lFPF) in reconstructing complex soft tissue leg and foot defects.
Patients and methods
Thirty consecutive adult (>15-year-old) patients with soft tissue defects in the leg and/or foot requiring tissue coverage with a flap in the period between 2012 and 2015 were randomly assigned (block randomization) to either an fGF or lFPF procedure. The outcome measures addressed were total billed charges costs, perioperative billed charges cost, partial or complete flap loss, length of hospital stay, inpatient postsurgical care duration, complications, operating time and number of operative scrub staff.
Results
One patient suffered from complete flap loss in each group. Reconstruction with lFPF showed total lower billed charges costs by 62% (2509 USD) (p < 0.001) and perioperative billed charges cost by 54% (779 USD) (p < 0.001), and shorter total hospital stay (36.5 days; p < 0.001), inpatient postsurgical care duration (6.4 days; p < 0.001), operating time (4.3 h; p < 0.001) and fewer scrub staff (2.2 persons; p < 0.001).
Conclusion
These results suggest that neither flap is totally superior to the other; the choice should instead be based on the outcome sought and logistics. lFPF requires lower billed charges cost and resource use and saves operative time and personnel and reduces length of hospital stay. Our approach changed towards using perforator flaps in medium-sized defects, keeping the free flap option for larger defects.}

According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of persons employed increased as nearly nine hundred thousand in November 2016, which implies the fact that demands of warehouses will increase in keeping with the growth of logistics industry. However, the necessity for energy savings was recognized as less important because the average energy use intensity of warehouses in the US was 55% and 70% less than those of office buildings and retail stores, respectively. Also, the improvement of indoor thermal environment for workers was often overlooked in comparison with safety, speed, and space efficiency. This research proposes a study for a warehouse building to mitigate both thermal dissatisfaction and energy use through the network based real-time analysis. In order to optimize heating and cooling supply, an algorithm for simultaneous control of the amount of air and its temperature is designed, and a neural network model that learns the algorithm is generated. Also, an inner algorithm for thermal comfort analyses real-time temperature levels and rectifies the model's control signals to mitigate thermal dissatisfaction. By comparing results, this research concludes advantages of a neural network model with estimating thermal comfort. The model reduces thermal dissatisfaction by 21.2% and saves energy use by 6.4% in comparison with the conventional thermostat on/off controller equipped in most buildings. Without compromising thermal comfort for workers, the proposed model that consists of two independent structures for optimizing supply air and estimating thermal comfort can contribute to the improvement of thermal performance for warehouses.}

In general, site-scale habitat quality has a stronger influence on habitat use by fauna than the landscape context. However, this is yet to be empirically tested for reptiles. In this study, we used model averaging and hierarchical partitioning to compare the relative importance of site-scale habitat quality and landscape context for reptile communities and species in a regenerating woodland landscape in semi-arid Queensland, Australia. Reptiles were surveyed at 55 sites. Habitat quality was assessed using relevant variables based on published habitat-associations for each species or group. Landscape context was assessed using binary, mosaic and continuous descriptions of vegetation cover within 250m of the survey sites. We found that, in comparison to site-scale habitat quality, the composition of the surrounding landscape had little influence on reptiles, despite testing three alternative approaches for describing landscape context. Nine out of eleven reptile species and groups responded to variation in habitat quality, whereas just one species responded to variation in landscape context. Species richness, diversity, and abundance were unaffected by landscape context, but were influenced by site-scale structural complexity and vegetation type. Our findings suggest that reptiles, in general, benefit from conservation and restoration activities that focus on improving site-scale habitat quality, with increasing the amount and connectivity of surrounding vegetation of lesser value. This study also highlights the importance of better understanding the drivers of reptile distributions and abundances in dryland landscapes.}

The industrial symbiosis (IS) approach can leverage this potential through industrial cooperation, fostering new businesses, innovation and job creation coupled with reduced environmental impacts. We argue that coupling the biorefinery concept and the IS approach would invigorate traditionally agricultural regions, relying on endogenous vocation to promote sustainability. The purpose of this study is to examine the potential for development of an agro-industrial symbiosis network (ISN) from the construction of a biorefinery in the Norte Fluminense region (Brazil) – a region that has become highly dependent on oil & gas revenues but still has a tradition in agriculture and agro-industry. In this paper, we present the scenario analysis performed to design the agro ISN and an initial quantification of potential benefits. Four scenarios were developed (reference, short, mid and long terms) with the support of a synergy matrix and material flow analysis. Eighteen waste streams were identified and sixteen were addressed through the scenarios. In the long-term scenario, 14 productive activities could compose the agro-industrial symbiosis network, 8 of them as newcomers. “Quick-wins” were identified as residues in the reference scenario (CO2, fusel oil and used yeast) that could be absorbed by industries currently operating in the region. The emission of respectively 350 thousand and 55 thousand tonnes per year of solid waste and CO2 would be avoided in the long term. Also, the production of succinic acid would provide additional revenue of at least US$19 per tonne of bagasse, adding higher value to the feedstock in comparison to electricity production. This study can prompt current recycling regulation towards multi-sectorial arrangements, which can better contribute to regional resilience than the single-sector reverse logistics’ arrangements that became recently mandatory with the National Policy on Solid Waste.}

Although prefabrication has its own benefits, its fundamental disadvantages of fragmentation, discontinuity, poor interoperability, and scarce real-time information availability have imposed significant adverse influence on the schedule performance of prefabricated house construction. As a result, despite the promise of the government to provide sufficient houses and harmonious housing, schedule delay problems still frequently beset the industry of PHC. To help address schedule delay problems encountered in the construction of prefabrication housing, this research first identified and analysed critical schedule risk factors that may have significant influence on the schedule performance of PHC. Based on the identified schedule risks, the challenges and corresponding required functions for enhancing schedule performance are determined. Then, a radio frequency identification device (RFID)-enabled BIM platform that integrates various involved stakeholders, information/data flow, offshore prefabrication procedures, and state-of-the-art construction technologies, is developed to handle the critical schedule factors. Smart construction objects and RFID-enabled smart gateway work collaboratively to ease operations within the three echelons of prefabrication manufacturing, logistics and on-site assembly construction, while real-time captured data are used to form a closed-loop visibility and traceability mode in which different end users can supervise the construction statuses, progresses in real time. The developed platform can provide various services, tools and mechanisms to different stakeholders, improve the success of daily operations and decision makings throughout PHC management, such that critical schedule risks can be mitigated and the schedule performance of PHC can be enhanced to ensure timely project delivery.}

Acknowledging that indirect land-use change can increase greenhouse gas emission, the European Union (EU) has reshaped its biofuel policy. It has set criteria for sustainability to ensure that the use of biofuels guarantees real carbon savings and protects biodiversity. From a sustainability perspective, biofuels and bioliquids offer indeed both advantages (e.g., more secure energy supply, emission reductions, reduced air pollution and production of high added-value molecules) as well as risks (monocultures, reduced biodiversity and even higher emissions through land use change). Approaching economic, environmental and social sustainability at the local level and in an integrated way should help to maximize benefits and minimize risks. This approach has been adopted and is described in the present work that combines chemical, biological, social and territorial studies on the management of pruning waste residues from olive trees in the Sierra Mágina in Spain. The biological and social analyses helped to orientate the research towards an attractive chemical process based on extraction and pyrolysis, in which high added value molecules are recovered and in which the residual biochar may be used as pathogen-free fertilizer. In this region where farmers face declining economic margins, the new intended method may both solve greenhouse gas emission problems and provide farmers with additional revenues and convenient fertilizers. Further research with a larger partnership will consolidate the results and tackle issues such as the logistics.}

However, the common scenario of a biostatistician simply needing to import a given dataset into their statistical software is at best under-served by these standards. Statisticians are forced to act as amateur database administrators to pivot and join their data into a usable form before they can even begin the work that they specialize in doing. Or worse, they find their choice of statistical tools dictated not by their own experience and skills, but by remote standards bodies or inertial administrative choices. This may limit academic freedom. If the formats in question require the use of one proprietary software package, it also raises concerns about vendor lock-in (DeLano, 2005) and stewardship of public resources. The logistics and transparency of data sharing can be made more tractable by an appreciation of the differences between structural, semantic, and syntactic levels of data interoperability. The semantic level is legitimately a complex problem. Here we make the case that, for the limited purpose of statistical analysis, a simplifying assumption can be made about structural level: the needs of a large number of statistical models can often be met with a modified variant of the first normal form or 1NF (Codd, 1979). Once data is merged into one such table, the syntactic level becomes a solved problem, with many text based formats available and robustly supported by virtually all statistical software without the need for any custom or third-party client-side add-ons. We implemented our denormalization approach in DataFinisher, an open source server-side add-on for i2b2 (Murphy et al., 2009), which we use at our site to enable self-service pulls of de-identified data by researchers.}

Respective logistics and market structures will be needed to cope with the spatial, temporal, and compositional variability of these feedstocks. At present, pilot-scale cellulosic biorefineries rely on vertically integrated supply systems designed to support traditional agricultural and forestry industries. The vision of the future feedstock supply system is a network of distributed biomass processing centers (depots) and centralized terminals. This introduces methods to increase feedstock volume while decreasing price and quality supply uncertainties. Depots are located close to the resource, while shipping and blending terminals are located in strategic logistical hubs with access to high bulk transportation systems. The system emulates the current grain commodity supply system, which manages crop diversity at the point of harvest and at the storage elevator, allowing subsequent supply system infrastructure to be similar for all resources. The initiation of depot (pilot) operations is seen as a strategic stepping stone to transition to this logistic system. A fundamental part of initiating (pilot-) depot operations is to establish the value proposition to the biomass grower, as biomass becomes available to the market place only through mobilization. A feedstock supply industry independently mobilizing biomass by producing value-add merchandisable intermediates creates a market push that will derisk and accelerate the deployment of bioenergy technologies. Companion markets can help mobilize biomass without biorefineries. That is, depots produce value-added intermediates that are fully fungible in both a companion and the biorefining market. To achieve this, a separation between feedstock supply and conversion industry may be necessary.}

The food service industry is responsible for supplying this food to schools, hospitals, nurseries, as well as to company canteens. The design, control, and management of food service operations is challenging given the complexity of such multiple facility production networks and entails multidisciplinary perspectives and competences. Both production and logistics operations play crucial roles and significantly affect the service performance as long as food products are prepared within a facility, and as long as they are distributed to multiple consumption sites. Hence, there are many planning decisions (e.g. the definition of the production facility location, the allocation of task to resources and the scheduling of production jobs), that are handled at different stages by different actors, who often decide based on their own practical experience and barely adopt integrated decision-support systems. A review of the literature shows that there is no integrated approach to support the design of food service production facilities, known as centralized kitchens (CEKIs). To facilitate such integration and assist food service managers to adopt quantitative and data-driven design approaches, this study proposes an original computer-based multidisciplinary decision-support tool for the design and configuration of a CEKI. The proposed tool aids decisions taken by multiple actors simultaneously through a set of interfaces driven by quantitative data that follow the logistical flow of materials throughout the CEKI (1), assesses performance indicators in a multidisciplinary dashboard (2), and implements what-if, multiple scenario analyses based on simulations (3). Graphical interfaces are designed to facilitate communication between the decision makers and the integration of data-driven analyses. The design of a new CEKI is used as a testbed for the decision-support tool. The real-world example highlights the interdependencies between issues and decisions and showcases how computer applications facilitate decision-making and improve communication between managers.}

Supply chain bottlenecks that prevent community health workers (CHWs) from accessing essential medicines significantly increase under-5 child mortality, particularly in poor and rural areas.
Objective
Using implementation research, interventions aimed at improving supply chain practices and access to medicines were tested in Malawi and Rwanda. These interventions included simple demand-based resupply procedures, using mobile technology and traditional methods for communication, and multilevel, performance-driven quality improvement (QI) teams.
Methods
Mixed-method evaluations were conducted at baseline (2010), midline (2013), and endline (2014). Baseline assessments identified common bottlenecks and established performance levels. Midline assessments identified which intervention package had the greatest impact. Endline surveys measured the progress of scale-up and institutionalization of each innovation.
Results
In both Rwanda and Malawi CHWs, health center staff, and district managers all cited many benefits of the establishment of resupply procedures and QI teams: such as providing structure and processes, a means to analyze and discuss problems and enhance collaboration between staff.
Conclusions
Implementing simple, streamlined, demand-based resupply procedures formed the basis for informed and regular resupply, and increased the visibility of appropriate and timely community logistics data. QI teams played a critical role in reinforcing resupply procedures and routinely unlocking the bottlenecks that prevent the continuous flow of critical health products. While simple, streamlined, demand-based resupply procedures provide the basis for regular, functional, and efficient resupply of CHWs, the procedures alone are not sufficient to create consistent change in product availability. Supporting these procedures with multilevel QI teams reinforces the correct and consistent use of resupply procedures.}

abstract = {As a result of increasing recognition of effective site management as the strategic approach for achieving the required performance in construction projects, this study seeks to identify the key site management practices that are requisite for construction waste minimization. A mixed methods approach, involving field study and survey research were used as means of data collection. After confirmation of construct validity and reliability of scale, data analysis was carried out through a combination of Kruskal-Wallis test, descriptive statistics and exploratory factor analysis. The study suggests that site management functions could significantly reduce waste generation through strict adherence to project drawings, and by ensuring fewer or no design changes during construction process. Provision of waste skips for specific materials and maximisation of on-site reuse of materials are also found to be among the key factors for engendering waste minimization. The result of factor analysis suggests four factors underlying on-site waste management practices with 96.093% of total variance. These measures include contractual provisions for waste minimization, waste segregation, maximisation of materials reuse and effective logistic management. Strategies through which each of the underlying measures could be achieved are further discussed in the paper. Findings of this study would assist construction site managers and other site operatives in reducing waste generated by construction activities.}

abstract = {Introduction/Background
Human motion tracking is widely used for assessment of movement dysfunction in orthopaedic patients. Currently, most clinical motion analysis centres use marker based three-dimensional systems as they are deemed to be the most accurate method. However, due to space, costs and logistics they are not available in many clinical settings. This study compared joint angles measured in functional tests using the novel low-cost Microsoft Kinect Perfect-Phorm marker-less system with the established marker based Nexus VICON system.
Material and method
Ten unimpaired volunteers were fitted with 16 retroreflective markers in the positions specified by the Plug-in-Gait (PiG) lower limb marker set. Participants were asked to make three movements: standing, a squat action and a hip abduction action. The two measurement systems were used simultaneously to measure changes in joint angle. The collection of data from each participant was synchronised manually between each system. Average values for left and right knee flexion (for the squat task) and left hip abduction (for the hip abduction task) were obtained from each system as the average across the steady state, and the relative change between the standing and task sections used as the basis of comparisons of system performance.
Results
When measuring right and left knee flexion, the average difference between the VICON and Perfect-Phorm measurement was 13.2%, with a SD of 19.6. Both overestimation and underestimation of the joint angle was recorded in different participants. Although the average percentage difference during hip abduction tests was lower at −3.9%, the range of error was far greater (SD=75).
Conclusion
From this, it can be concluded that the level of accuracy presented in the new low cost Perfect-Phorm marker-less system is not yet suitable for clinical assessments. However, for general tests of performance, and for tracking cases where absolute accuracy is less critical, future versions of this software may have a place.}

Studies are inadequate in analysing the causal factors of food losses in this context. This study intends to identify the causes of food wastage, as well as the driving power and dependence of these causes and to analyse the interactions among them. This work proposes to use fuzzy MICMAC and total interpretive structural modeling (TISM) based approach which is a novel effort in this sector, to study the interactions. Based on review of literature and brainstorming among experts in the food industry and academia, this study identified 16 variables as the super-set of causal factors of food wastage which can represent all other causes within them. It is found that the lack of scientific methods in harvesting and a large number of intermediaries in the chain have high driving power and can be considered as the root causes of the food losses. This work categorises the causes into several levels that give an idea regarding the cause which needs more attention than others. Thereby it provides practical insights into how to improve efficiency, competitiveness, and profitability of the food supply chains. For a developing country like India, in addition to the economy, it can have greater implications on food security and conservation of environment resources. This work can be utilized by supply chain designers, managers, and policy makers.}

Existing supplier selection models also tend to focus on the formulation of a simplified supply chain structure rather than considering more realistic supply chain operations under multiple sourcing and product designs. To facilitate the complex decision-making process of global supplier selection problems, this study proposes an integrated approach that consists of two phases to effectively reflect the multi-perspectives of global supply chain design for sustainability. The first phase identifies sustainable supplier regions through multi-attribute utility theory, considering four regional sustainability indices for economic and social factors in global business and logistics, to reflect the decision maker's risk attitudes on global business opportunities. In the second phase, a multi-objective integer linear programming model for multiple sourcing and multiple product designs that minimizes economic and environmental objectives is applied to find optimal suppliers and their order quantities in the regions selected from the first phase. The proposed approach is illustrated through a bicycle supplier selection case study. The results show that the multi-objective sustainable decision under a multiple sourcing strategy for different product designs leads to a supply chain that is significantly different from the single-objective non-sustainable decisions. The case study under different decision scenarios shows that a decision maker should hold a balanced perspective under the multi-objective decision environment for sustainable supply chain design.}

To accurately assess cardiopulmonary fitness of stroke patients and to analyze its related factors.
Material and method
The basic data of 38 stroke patients, such as age, sex, height, etc., were collected. Fugl–Meyer, MMSE, ADL, and Berg scales were used to evaluate their exercise function, cognitive function, daily activity and balance function. All the patient used the power bicycle to carry out the maximum progressive cardiopulmonary exercise test with a restrictive symptom, and data on cardiopulmonary index, subjective fatigue, heart rate, blood pressure and other data were collected. Single factor analysis and multiple factors logistics regression analysis of cardiopulmonary fitness in stroke patients were carried out by SPSS 17.0 statistical software to explore the factors affecting the cardiopulmonary fitness.
Results
Thirty-eight stroke patients enrolled in the study were able to complete the cardiopulmonary exercise test without adverse events. Cardiopulmonary fitness significantly decreased (VO2peak was 12.89+3.42mL/kg/min). Single factor analysis showed that age, sex, Fugl–Meyer, MMSE, ADL, bad habits and daily exercise habits were the influencing factors of cardiopulmonary fitness in stroke patients (P<0.05). Multiple factor logistic regression analysis showed that high Fugl–Meyer score, high MMSE score and regular exercise habit were independent protective factors of cardiopulmonary fitness (OR<1), while advanced age, women and bad living habits were their independent risk factors (OR>1).
Conclusion
Cardiopulmonary fitness significantly decreases in stroke patients. High Fugl–Meyer score, high MMSE score and regular exercise habit are independent protective factors of cardiopulmonary fitness, while advanced age, women and bad living habits are its independent risk factors.}

abstract = {Introduction
Relapse prevention during early stages after psychosis onset is a key factor for long term outcome. While factors associated with first relapse have been widely studied, factors associated with subsequent relapses are poorly described.
Objectives
To determine predictive factors of first and subsequent relapses among patients recruited from a cohort of PAFIP Early Intervention Program.
Material and methods
We analyzed socio-demographic and clinical data of a cohort of 393 first episode psychosis (FEP) patients that were recruited since February 2001 to May 2011. Of these, 341 achieved clinical remission and were, therefore, considered to be at risk of relapse. They were followed-up for 3 years. A wide range of potential factors were included as possible predictors of relapse. Test univariate, analysis logistics of regression, regression of Cox and analysis of survival of Kaplan-Meier were carried out.
Results
Poor adherence to medication was the main predictor associated to first relapse (ExpB: 2.979; P<0.001). After the first relapse, only 56 patients (33.9%) underwent a second relapse, being the diagnosis (ExpB: 1.975; P=0.074), the age of onset, (ExpB: 1.078; P=0.003) and a low level of positive symptomatology (ExpB: 0.863; P=0.03) the predictors of associated with a second relapse.
Conclusions
After a FEP, non-adherence to medication is the main predictor of first relapse. Second and subsequent relapses relate with non-modifiable factors such as age of onset or schizophrenia diagnosis. This subgroup of patients could have greater predisposition to relapse related with the severity of the disease itself.}

This study performed psychophysical experiments to assess the effect of interior visual environment on the driving safety of drivers by using the 3ds Max software, driving simulator, and E-prime software. A rhythm-based marking system was proposed to improve the visual environment of tunnels by arranging rhythm curves on side walls and note symbols on pavements, as well as multi-frequency markings (high, medium and low frequency). The accuracy rate of speed judgment and reaction time of drivers were analyzed by statistical methods and the logistics curve fitting method. The results showed that: (a) single-color rhythm markings enhanced the accuracy ratio of speed judgment by 3.33–11.66%, while multi-color rhythm markings increase this parameter by 3.33–25%. The accuracy ratio was increased by 18.33% for the second change of color in multi-color rhythm markings (t=72s); (b) for common highway tunnels, the reaction time of drivers showed a significant association with the driving duration in the tunnel. For tunnels with improved visual environment by rhythm markings, no significant relationship between the reaction time and driving time was noted, with drivers' fatigue effectively released; and (c) the driver reaction time depended on both the visual environment and driving duration. Rhythm markings in tunnels could effectively reduce driver reaction time. Multi-color markings had better effects than monochrome ones.}

In this paper we present the findings of a survey of 181 mobile phone owners, aged between 18–25years old, living and studying in the UK, which explored mobile phone ownership, reasons for hibernation, and replacement motives. This paper also outlines and implements a novel mechanism for quantifying the mean hibernation period based on the survey findings. The results show that only 33.70% of previously owned mobile phones were returned back into the system. The average duration of ownership of mobile phones kept and still in hibernation was 4years 11months, with average use and hibernation durations of 1year 11months, and 3years respectively; on average, mobile phones that are kept by the user are hibernated for longer than they are ever actually used as primary devices. The results also indicate that mobile phone replacement is driven primarily by physical (technological, functional and absolute) obsolescence, with economic obsolescence, partly in response to the notion of being ‘due an upgrade’, also featuring significantly. We also identify in this paper the concept of a secondary phone, a recently replaced phone that holds a different function for the user than their primary phone but is still valued and intentionally retained by the user, and which, we conclude, should be accounted for in any reverse logistics strategy.}

This paper presents a quantitative assessment of the environmental and economic attributes of two major WtE technologies: landfill gas to energy (LFG-to-energy) and incineration in Thai cities. Net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, net fossil resource consumption and net life-cycle cost (LCC) were used as the basic indicators for measuring performance of these two technologies from a life cycle perspective. The assessment found that at the current efficiency level, both the LFG-to-energy project and the incineration facility contribute to GHG mitigation and fossil resource savings as compared to the Business as Usual (BAU) practice. However, the financial returns from these operations are very low and insufficient to compensate the costs. The paper argues that substantial improvements of WtE plants can be made by adopting proper management practices, enhancing the efficiencies of energy production. Such upgrading would further reduce GHG emissions, increase fossil resource savings and strengthen the financial performance to the benefit of local governments. The authors recognize the potential of incorporating other treatment options along with WtE technologies, for moving towards more sustainable waste management approaches like integrated waste management systems.}

The development of diagnostic imaging services manifests features specific to the Scottish environment, in particular development of the radiographic workforce through implementing skills mix and role developments to enhance outcomes for patients. A component of a College of Radiographers Industry Partnership Scheme (CoRIPS) supported study, this research investigates perspectives of strategic service managers with Health Board responsibility for service delivery.
Method
A questionnaire survey was administered to strategic service managers across Scotland (N = 14), followed up with telephone interviews. There was a return rate of 57% (n = 8) for the questionnaires and n = 4 agreed to be interviewed. Data collected related to radiographer roles across their Board area; awareness and understanding of service development issues and features as well as perspective on opportunities and barriers in the context of Scottish Government policy, workforce logistics, attitudes and inter-professional relationships.
Results
The results indicate evidence of financial, logistical and political barriers to service evolution, offset by a sense of optimism that scope for beneficial change may be approaching. There are a range of significant initiatives in place and an appetite exists to pursue the development of radiographer roles and skill mix for the benefit of service users more generally.
Conclusion
The difficulties in achieving change are well understood and there are basic issues related to finance and industrial relations. There are also however, cultural elements to contend with in the form of attitudes demonstrated by some radiographers and significantly, the radiological community whose influence on the practice of independently regulated radiographers seems incongruent.}

This study aimed to determine the cost-effectiveness of a PROficiency based StePwise Endovascular Curricular Training (PROSPECT) program, including e-learning and hands on virtual reality simulation.
Methods
A prospective, single blinded, randomised controlled trial (RCT) was carried out to evaluate the impact of a PROSPECT training program on real life operative performance. Under supervision, all subjects performed two endovascular interventions on patients with symptomatic iliac and/or superficial femoral artery stenosis. Primary outcomes were technical performance (Global Rating Scale, Examiner Checklist), operative metrics, and patient outcomes, adjusted for case difficulty and the trainee's experience. Additionally, an analysis of costs and savings related to implementation of this endovascular training program was performed. Thirty-two general surgery trainees were randomised into three groups: group 1 (n = 11) received e-learning and simulation training (PROSPECT program); group 2 (n = 10) only had access to e-learning; group 3 (n = 11) did not receive supplementary education besides clinical training. Developmental cost, implementation cost, training time cost, and the operational cost of PROSPECT were determined. Time spent studying and practicing was converted to indirect saving of operating time. The costs of logistics, faculty time supervising simulation sessions, and 30 day complication rates were registered. Sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the robustness of the results.
Results
Fifty-eight peripheral endovascular interventions, performed by 29 surgical trainees (three dropouts) were included in this RCT from October 2014 to February 2016. Annual costs from the perspective of the hospital were €6589 for curriculum design, €31,484 for implementation, and €1143 in operational costs. Per trainee, simulation based training until proficiency cost €3806. In comparison, if endovascular proficiency levels were obtained with conventional training only, this may have cost €5001 per trainee.
Conclusion
Simulation based training in endovascular procedures may be cost saving, because training occurs outside the angiosuite. It is possible that cost savings are underestimated as, in contrast to the literature, prevented costs related to complications could not be defined.}

This work aims to examine the feasibility of biomass torrefaction downstream in long-distance international bioenergy supply chains for co-firing and to investigate the effect of various biomass co-firing ratios on the whole supply and energy conversion system performance from a technical, environmental and economic aspect. A techno-economic analysis together with a CO2 emissions assessment is performed, adopting a whole systems approach. In particular, Palm Kernel Shell biomass from Malaysia is considered for co-firing in UK. Findings indicate that downstream torrefaction is profitable under the current conditions for 100% biomass and marginally unprofitable for 50% biomass co-firing. The financial yield exhibits high sensitivity on the price of coal, biomass, Renewable Obligation Certificates, the torrefaction facility investment and biomass sea transportation costs. From an environmental perspective, higher co-firing ratios lead to higher emissions per unit of renewable energy generated. The findings can support policy makers and investors in adopting lower biomass co-firing ratios with torrefaction instead of 100% biomass conversion, leading to improved environmental benefits from a whole system's perspective.}

Based on a literature review, we first identify 19 environmentally relevant decision criteria which determine transport processes, such as delivery times, delivery frequency, or mode choice. We group these criteria depending on the time horizon and their influenceability by a company decision-maker and further apply them to empirically enquire in a life cycle assessment case study about the relationship between freight transport processes and the related environmental impacts. The case example of a resource intense and heavy-weight product represents a typical product system with long transport distances and economic as well as environmental relevance. By means of some robustness tests we further show how some criteria which are controllable and influenceable in the short and medium term trigger the indicator results. Finally, we develop a decision tree approach to prioritize actions and derive environmental transport strategies depending on the time horizon and the influenceability of the decision criteria. While the decision tree is from a manufacturing company’s perspective, it has relevance also for other actors along the supply chain and in politics. With this literature review, case study, and decision-tree approach we contribute to transportation research and practice and thereby aim to incentivize decision-makers to systematically explore the sources of environmental impacts and continuously improve the environmental performance of freight activity.}

abstract = {Development finance offers several solutions to support economic activity in poor areas usually based on a lending system. Such a perspective is mainly founded on the idea that the payment of a high interest rate by small farmers and small producers can compensate their non-sustainability or non-bankability. Instead of focusing on individual producers, sustainability which is a macro-concept would more likely be obtained at the level of the overall value chain. Agriculture’s potential to develop rural areas depends on the scale of production and its impact on regional consumption and economy altogether. This article presents a way of improving these fundamental aspects through the development of a post-Marxist scheme transforming agriculture into a growth engine even for emerging countries. With this purpose, we introduce a new development model called PMF (Production Mutualisation Fund) whose aim is to mutualize the production and post-production chains and, therefore, extend the notion of bankability to the whole value chain. Such initiative suggests an alternative way of thinking development finance. It is no more about finding a way to lend money to the non-sustainable smallholders\producers. It is about financing viable industrial service companies which will provide all necessary services to secure an optimized production, traceability and distribution of processed agricultural produce to end-distributors. This goes beyond the mere agricultural sphere and applies to many production sectors increasingly challenged by a forever accelerated deployment of new technologies: it combines the implementation of production services with infrastructure services (water management, logistics, power production and supply, etc.) to support a production economy using the producer’s income as the key variable to optimize. In other words, such a model can contribute to the development of least to most industrialized economies.}

abstract = {Introduction
Populations and routine childhood vaccine regimens have changed substantially since supply chains were designed in the 1980s, and introducing new vaccines during the “Decade of Vaccine” may exacerbate existing bottlenecks, further inhibiting the flow of all vaccines.
Methods
Working with the Mozambique Ministry of Health, our team implemented a new process that integrated HERMES computational simulation modeling and on-the-ground implementers to evaluate and improve the Mozambique vaccine supply chain using a system-re-design that integrated new supply chain structures, information technology, equipment, personnel, and policies.
Results
The alternative system design raised vaccine availability (from 66% to 93% in Gaza; from 76% to 84% in Cabo Delgado) and reduced the logistics cost per dose administered (from $0.53 to $0.32 in Gaza; from $0.38 to $0.24 in Cabo Delgado) as compared to the multi-tiered system under the current EPI. The alternative system also produced higher availability at lower costs after new vaccine introductions. Since reviewing scenarios modeling deliveries every two months in the north of Gaza, the provincial directorate has decided to pilot this approach diverging from decades of policies dictating monthly deliveries.
Discussion
Re-design improved not only supply chain efficacy but also efficiency, important since resources to deliver vaccines are limited. The Mozambique experience and process can serve as a model for other countries during the Decade of Vaccines. For the Decade of Vaccines, getting vaccines at affordable prices to the market is not enough. Vaccines must reach the population to be successful.}

Among the agronomic practices applied for giant reed (Arundo donax L.) production, harvesting may weigh for a relative high percentage on the overall balance. Till now, conventional and modified machinery have been used for the production of different type of biomass (shredded, chipped, baled). In the present study an economic and energy analysis of harvesting systems and biomass transport has been conducted considering three actual cases of study representative of common harvesting systems in Italy and Spain: single-pass (chipping and loading) and two passes (mowing plus chipping and loading or crushing and windrowing plus baling). The aim of the work was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness and the environmental sustainability of the different options. The number of operations (single or two passes) did not weigh on the final result, and the economic criterion did not coincide with the energy one. The cost of harvesting for the single-pass system was the lowest (17.9€tdm−1), but the economic costs of the whole chain (harvesting and transport) were more convenient for baling, and the energy demand of both systems was similar. Evidence was provided that factors like type of machinery, effective field capacity, yield, moisture content, bulk density and crop uniformity influenced the harvesting costs (from both economic and energy viewpoints) and the delivery of the biomass from the field to the first collection point. Therefore, a case-by-case analysis is recommended in order to optimize the logistics of a particular bioenergy plant.}

Owing to short service life and environmental pollution hazards, recycling and reuse of e-bicycle batteries has always been a focus of industry and academia. As a typical case of both production and use of large electric bicycles, 113 major sellers, 378 corporate and individual buyers, 147 large e-bicycle repair centers, and 1317 e-bicycle owners in Xuzhou City were investigated in order to understand the sales, use, recycling, and disposal of spent e-bicycle batteries. The findings show that the existing distempered recycling system is the main limitation of spent battery recovery, and the actual recovery rate of spent batteries is lower than the estimated output (QW) for the years 2011–2014. Electric bicycle sellers play a fundamental role in the collection of spent batteries in Xuzhou, accounting for 42.3±8.3% of all batteries recovered. The widespread use of lithium batteries in recent years has resulted in a reduction in spent battery recycling because of lower battery prices. Furthermore, consumer preferences are another important factor affecting the actual recovery rate according to survey results evaluated using canonical correspondence analysis. In this paper, we suggest that a reverse logistics network system for spent battery recycling should be established in the future; in addition, enhancing producer responsibility, increasing publicity, raising of public awareness, developing green public transport, and reducing dependence on e-bicycles also should be pursued. This study seeks to provide guidance for planning construction and management policies for an effective spent battery recycling system in China and other developing countries.}

abstract = {Remanufacturing has been considered as viable way to mitigate the side effects of product disposal and reduce associated cost in the entire value chain. However, challenges still remain to be solved for remanufacturing practice. One of the negative facets lies in the fact that the opportunity of component reuse in remanufacturing will be jeopardized due to component obsolescence. In literature, it is claimed that higher profit can be generated if multiple generations of product are designed and manufactured concurrently in a forward-looking manner compared to a single product generation at a time. Furthermore, there is inherent delay in time-to-market of remanufactured products compared to manufacturing new products due to product useful lifespan and reverse logistics lead time. The possibility that remanufacturing will overlap with the life cycle of successive product generations is high. Therefore, it is imperative for designers and remanufacturers to jointly manage component reuse in remanufacturing by deliberately considering product diffusion dynamics and concurrent design of multiple product generations in their decisions such as component commonality, acquisition cost and time delay in remanufacturing. In this paper, we investigate how product diffusion dynamics in the market affect the volume of component reuse in remanufacturing across multiple product generations. The trade-offs with respect to component commonality in product family design among multiple product generations are identified and analyzed based on developed models. Numerical analysis is conducted to demonstrate the applicability of our methodology and generate managerial insights. We anticipate that the outcome of this study could contribute to a better understanding and planning of sustainable product design. In a longer perspective, the results may provide the necessary theoretical foundation for accelerating the development and integration of design, manufacturing, and services to improve responsiveness of the overall design chain and its efficiency from both technical and economic perspective.}

This paper investigates consolidated transport solutions with a common shipment frequency. When a service provider designs such a solution for its customers, she faces a trade-off: to have the most time-sensitive customers join the consolidated solution, the frequency must be high, which makes it difficult to gather enough demand to reach the scale economies of the solution; but by not having the most time-sensitive customers join, there will be less demand per time unit, which also makes it difficult to reach the scale economies. In this paper we investigate the service provider’s pricing and timing problem and the environmental implications of the optimal policy. The service provider is responsible for multiple customers’ transports, and offers all customers two long-term contracts at two different prices: direct express delivery with immediate dispatch at full cost, or consolidated delivery at a given frequency at a reduced cost. It is shown that the optimal policy is largely driven by customer heterogeneity: limited heterogeneity in customers’ costs leads to very different optimal policies compared to large heterogeneity. We argue that the reason so many consolidation projects fail may be due to a strategic mismatch between heterogeneity and consolidation policy. We also show that even if the consolidated solution is implemented, it may lead to a larger environmental impact than direct deliveries due to inventory build-up or a higher-than-optimal frequency of the consolidated transport.}

Entering the China pharmaceutical market has been viable and beneficial options for international and multinational companies. However, the opportunities and challenges and their interrelations are not well discussed yet. This study aims to (1) determine key dimensions for Taiwanese pharmaceutical companies entering the China pharmaceutical market through literature review, eliciting experts’ preferences, and cluster analysis; (2) to analyze the relative weights of assessment dimensions and their interactions by applying the DANP method to the results of the expert interviews that had been conducted with a DEMATEL questionnaire; (3) to provide investment philosophy and suggestions to Taiwanese pharmaceutical companies for entry strategies to the China pharmaceutical market. The result shows that the financial dimension gets the highest weight, followed by personnel, product development, distribution, market and policy/regulations. This study suggests that Pharmaceutical companies should carefully evaluate the development and sufficiency of investment funds and protection of management rights in China. Pharmaceutical companies should also carefully develop personnel in China by enhancing professional competence, loyalty, stability and practical experience. From the distribution perspective, the companies should pay attention to choose agents or distributors, and choose the business partners who have local sales channels as the first priority. The policy/regulations dimension is a significant facet which suggests that the companies should exactly know what the Chinese medicine policy/regulations and their changes. In the market dimension, the companies should assess medical needs in China with the arrangement of internal resources to enhance enterprise strength for developing China pharmaceutical market. China has a vast territory where the distribution and operating risk are not negligible. The companies should firstly deploy their business in the regulatory compliance city or regional markets. This study also applies appropriate statistical methods for DANP reliability test to fill the research gap of conventional DANP analysis.}

abstract = {Objective
Peripheral nerve injury (PNI) is a common and potentially devastating complication in cardiac surgery. Somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) monitoring is one of the modalities for PNI; however, its application is limited by complicated logistics. This study aimed to assess the feasibility of using a novel, automated SSEP device (EPAD; SafeOp Surgical, Hunt Valley, MD) for detection of intraoperative PNI during cardiac surgery.
Design
Prospective, observational study.
Setting
Single university hospital.
Participants
Cardiac surgical patients.
Interventions
After Ethics Board approval and written consent, study participants were monitored using the EPAD automated SSEP device during cardiac surgery. All patients with prolonged and abnormal SSEP changes were evaluated postoperatively, and if they were symptomatic, they were referred for further nerve conduction and electromyographic assessment.
Measurements and Main Results
Of the 43 patients who consented to study inclusion, 33 were monitored successfully. With increasing clinical experience the authors encountered minimal technical issues, and satisfactory signals were obtained in most patients. Abnormal SSEP signal changes, which were encountered in 5 (15.2%) patients, were interpreted as impending PNI; 3 patients experienced prolonged signal changes (>1 h), and 2 (6.1%) of these developed symptomatic peripheral neuropathy that was confirmed with nerve conduction studies.
Conclusions
The EPAD automated SSEP device is a viable option for detecting PNI during cardiac surgery. A high incidence of intraoperative peripheral nerve compromise and a 6.1% incidence of postoperative peripheral neuropathy were observed. This study reports the clinical feasibility of using the EPAD automated SSEP device; additional studies are required to evaluate the diagnostic test accuracy and the outcome benefit of routine SSEP monitoring in cardiac surgical patients.}

Changing production patterns demanding greater end to end visibility by customers and accessibility to key inland population centers assume greater importance in the organization and design of transport resources and cargo flows. While synchronization of all aspects of the supply chain has become an operational necessity for firms, it is often held hostage to the efficiency of hinterland networks who must respond to a large group of stakeholders with sporadic coordination. This is particularly true when looking at the central US city and region of Chicago, a critical intermodal exchange point for truck, air and river barge traffic domestic and global, as well as a major central distribution location. This paper analyzes supply chain integration (SCI) efforts in the metropolitan Chicago region and considers efforts by public and private actors to collaborate for region-wide SCI improvements. Pareto analysis suggests that concentrated freight corridors exist, influencing freight planning for regional transportation networks more directly than diffused regional freight movements. If the corridor service becomes less responsive or congested the corridor will move to different end nodes within the broad region. Regional planning must thus address national, regional, and local moves. Private/public sector infrastructure firms should address functional cooperation on SCI by focusing on corridors as well as local improvements.}

Despite an abundance of forest area alongside the promotion of biomass in energy policies, however, woody biomass utilization still remains low in Japan. The woody biomass supply chain, considered as a socio-technical system, involves a complex, cross-sectoral stakeholder network in which inter-organizational dynamics necessitates well-organized management based on an understanding of formal factors such as technology, as well as informal factors such as social relations and culture. In this paper, success factor perceptions from across the woody biomass supply chain are investigated based on semi-structured interviews with four stakeholders in the Kyushu region of Japan. Identified success factors here are: 1) respect of values & traditions, 2) transportation infrastructure, 3) business model integration, 4) relationship & trust, 5) local vitalization and 6) biomass quality control. A convergence as well as divergence of perceptions are observed, involving both formal and informal dimensions. Aiming to balance perceptions and to enable long-term success of woody biomass in Japan, a series of policy implications are drawn, including cross-ministerial integration, knowledge building on wood logistics, forest certification, local coordinators, biomass quality control standards and a feed-in-tariff for heat. This paper suggests a new arena of policy-making based on the importance of considering both informal and formal dimensions in energy policy.}

In particular, the potential of Eco-efficient PSS to promote more sustainable industrial practices, such as re-use and re-manufacturing, has been discussed outlining the possible environmental advantages deriving from a more intense use of resources and emphasizing the economic benefits for producers as well. In recent years, together with barriers hindering the implementation of such strategies, authors started discussing also some ‘rebound effects’ that could limit the expected re-manufacturing environmental benefits, such as the obsolescence of re-manufactured products, especially in case of fast technology cycles. To overcome these criticalities and to target high-value customers segment, the concept of product upgrade in re-manufacturing has been introduced. Upgrade cycles would allow embedding technological innovation into products, to reach advanced environmental performances over time and to satisfy evolving customers’ preferences. However, the concept of product re-manufacturing with upgrade has been treated mainly theoretically with limited evidence of industrial applications in PSS. Producers currently engaged in established remanufacturing practices are mainly big manufacturers of durable or long life-time products, in particular in the B2B sector, while only few pioneering cases of PSS offering product upgrade are cited in literature, mainly referring to B2C. To contribute to the progress of the state of the art and to move from theory to industrial application, this article takes a business model perspective for the implementation of remanufacturing with upgrade PSS. A coherent configuration value proposition, supply chain and reverse logistics, revenue model and ownership scheme is proposed, aiming at addressing the major criticalities and barriers encountered in the literature for the implementation of remanufacturing strategies. The producer will play a central role in the business model, since he has the knowledge and capability to conceive product's design and supply chains suited to perform remanufacturing and upgrade cycles. Potential benefits, and unsolved barriers to the implementation of the proposed business model are finally introduced in order to suggest future research directions.}

This study leveraged the high spatial and temporal coverage provided by remote-sensing ocean colour products, and the concept of biogeographical classification to delineate areas in the pelagic environment with application to marine conservation. Satellite-derived and modelled biogeophysical data were used to delineate an area of biological and physical homogeneity spatially consistent with the static boundaries of the Scotian Slope Ecologically and Biologically Significant Area (EBSA), off eastern Canada. We used iterative cluster analysis applied to an archive (2004–2014) that consisted of remotely-sensed Chlorophyll a, sea-surface temperature, and primary production derived from the Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and simulated mixed layer depth to define “dynamic” boundaries of the EBSA at bi-weekly, seasonal and annual resolutions. The final cluster extended further east than the static EBSA in summer and fall, indicating that characteristics of the static EBSA environment persist beyond the current boundaries in these seasons. In winter and spring, the final areas derived by our analysis was smaller than the static EBSA, but again showed extension beyond the current eastern boundary. Both ice and cloud cover affecting remotely-sensed data and the extent of water column mixing were important in determining the size of the final cluster. The dynamic cluster east of the original static boundary incorporated an area of lower Chlorophyll a and water column primary production in the spring, but higher values in the autumn relative to the static area. Overall physical and biological characteristics of the static and dynamic EBSA considered in this research were similar within and across years. This methodology incorporates ocean-colour data and modelled estimates of multiple biological and physical characteristics to objectively refine areas of ecological interest at a spatial scale relevant for the management of marine conservation areas.}

We propose a mixed integer nonlinear programming model to determine the optimal inventory policy for the stages in the supply chain and allocation of orders among the suppliers at the initial stage. Transportation costs between consecutive stages are modeled using a piecewise constant setup cost structure arising from a full truckload freight rate cost model. Vehicles of different capacities are available to transport materials from the suppliers to the manufacturing facility and between the remaining stages of the supply chain. The usefulness of the model is discussed with an example. Sensitivity analysis is carried out to determine the effect of cost parameters on supplier order allocation. The analysis shows that the selection of suppliers and the corresponding order quantities are affected by the variations in supply chain costs parameters. In addition, the advantages of using an integrated approach versus a sequential approach for inventory replenishment and supplier selection decisions are shown. Computational results show that the integrated approach yields average savings of 4.88% in total cost and 15.31% in logistics costs over the sequential approach.}

abstract = {Background
Plasma-first resuscitation attenuates trauma-induced coagulopathy (TIC); however, the logistics of plasma-first resuscitation require thawed plasma (TP) be readily available due to the obligatory thawing time of fresh frozen plasma (FFP). The current standard is storage of TP for up to 5 days at 4°C, based on factor levels at outdate, for use in patients at risk for TIC, but there remains a 2.2% outdated wastage rate. However, the multitude of plasma proteins in attenuating TIC remains unknown. We hypothesize that TP retains the ability to enhance clotting and reduce tPA-induced fibrinolysis at 14-day storage.
Methods
FFP was thawed and stored at 4°C at the following intervals: 14, 10, 7, 5, 3, and 1-day prior to the experiment. Healthy volunteers underwent blood draws followed by 50% dilution with TP stored at previously mentioned intervals as well as FFP, normal saline (NS), albumin, and whole blood (WB) control. Samples underwent tPA-modified (75 ng/mL) thrombelastography (TEG) with analysis of R-time, angle, maximum amplitude (MA), and LY30.
Results
TEG properties did not change significantly over the thawed storage. 14-day TP retained the ability to inhibit tPA-induced hyperfibrinolysis (median LY30% 9.6%) similar to FFP (5.6%), WB (14.6%), and superior to albumin (59.3%) and NS (58.1%). 14-day TP also retained faster clot formation (median angle, 66.2°) and superior clot strength (MA, 61.5 mm) to albumin (34.8°, 21.6 mm) and NS (41.6°, 32.2 mm).
Conclusions
TP plasma stored for 14 days retains clot-enhancing ability and resistance to clot degradation similar to FFP. A clinical trial is needed to validate these in vitro results.}

For treatment of flowback, multiple on-site treatment systems are available for primary separation (i.e. reducing TSS concentrations and particle size below 25 μm for disposal), secondary separation (i.e. removing TSS, iron and main scaling ions, and reducing particle size up to 5 μm for reuse), or tertiary treatment (i.e. reducing TDS concentration in the permeate/distillate to below 500 mg/L) for recycling or discharge. Depending on geographic features, frac-fluid characteristics, and regulatory aspects, operators may choose disposal or reuse of flowback water. Among these approaches, desalination is the least utilized option while in the majority of cases on-site basic separation is selected which can result in savings up to $306,800 per well. Compared to desalination systems, basic separation systems (e.g. electrocoagulation, dissolved air floatation) have higher treatment capacity (159–4133 m3/d) and specific water treatment production per occupied space (8.9–58.8 m3/m2), lower treatment costs ($2.90 to $13.30 per m3) and energy demand, and finally generate less waste owing to their high recovery of 98–99.5%, which reduces both operator costs and environmental burdens.}

abstract = {Background
While our previous work has shown that replacing existing vaccines with thermostable vaccines can relieve bottlenecks in vaccine supply chains and thus increase vaccine availability, the question remains whether this benefit would outweigh the additional cost of thermostable formulations.
Methods
Using HERMES simulation models of the vaccine supply chains for the Republic of Benin, the state of Bihar (India), and Niger, we simulated replacing different existing vaccines with thermostable formulations and determined the resulting clinical and economic impact. Costs measured included the costs of vaccines, logistics, and disease outcomes averted.
Results
Replacing a particular vaccine with a thermostable version yielded cost savings in many cases even when charging a price premium (two or three times the current vaccine price). For example, replacing the current pentavalent vaccine with a thermostable version without increasing the vaccine price saved from $366 to $10,945 per 100 members of the vaccine’s target population. Doubling the vaccine price still resulted in cost savings that ranged from $300 to $10,706, and tripling the vaccine price resulted in cost savings from $234 to $10,468. As another example, a thermostable rotavirus vaccine (RV) at its current (year) price saved between $131 and $1065. Doubling and tripling the thermostable rotavirus price resulted in cost savings ranging from $102 to $936 and $73 to $808, respectively. Switching to thermostable formulations was highly cost-effective or cost-effective in most scenarios explored.
Conclusion
Medical cost and productivity savings could outweigh even significant price premiums charged for thermostable formulations of vaccines, providing support for their use.}

abstract = {The use of biomass in energy sector is continuously growing all over the world due to a number of factors such as low emissions, need for alternative energy sources, increased government initiatives for renewable energy technologies and a substantial untapped biomass potential. But, the economics of biomass based power projects depends on the long term and secure supplies of sustainable feedstock. In case of agricultural residues, the feasibility of installation of a power plant is directly dependent on the transport cost and their availability in a region. Therefore, region-wise planning and policies are required to promote their utilization for energy purpose. The present paper summarizes the methodology to evaluate the state-wise power potential of agricultural residues in India. Further, other issues related with their utilization for electricity generation have also been discussed. It has been revealed that biomass power potential is highest in the state of Uttar Pradesh (6045 MW) followed by Punjab (3585 MW), Maharashtra (3139 MW) and Haryana (2300 MW), while its value varies significantly within the country. But, these resources are not exploited to a considerable extent by various states due to a number of challenges. The logistics of biomass collection and the moisture contents are the major barriers in this regard. But, selection of appropriate technology (combustion or gasification) and favorable policies (for use of biomass for energy) can help to resolve these issues. Various government incentives (at state and central level) such as schemes, grants and subsidies have encouraged the adoption of the grid connected biomass combustion/cogeneration projects (at megawatt scale) and the off-grid gasification units (small scale plants) for rural electrification. The study reveals that the future targets for the biomass based installed capacity can be achieved by successful implementation of these schemes in the country.}

Methods for internal loading of drugs within RBCs are now entering clinical use. Although internal loading can result in membrane disruption that may compromise biocompatibility, surface loading using either affinity or chemical ligands offers a diverse set of approaches for the production of RBC drug carriers. A wide range of surface determinants is potentially available for this approach, although there remains a need to characterize the effects of coupling agents to these surface proteins. Somewhat surprisingly, recent data also suggest that red cell–mediated delivery may confer tolerogenic immune effects. Questions remaining before widespread application of these technologies include determining the optimal loading protocol, source of RBCs, and production logistics, as well as addressing regulatory hurdles. Red blood cell drug carriers, after many decades of progress, are now poised to enter the clinic and broaden the potential application of RBCs in blood transfusion.}

The container loading problem is computationally complex and, despite extensive academic effort, there remains room for algorithm improvement. Real-world problems are not always addressed satisfactorily primarily due to the large number of complex constraints and objectives. The problem addressed by this work is an unsolved multiple container loading problem introduced by Renault on the occasion of the 2014/2015 ESICUP challenge, organized by the EURO Special Interest Group on Cutting and Packing (ESICUP). Renault’s problem requires a large number of different items to be packed into containers of different types and sizes. Items must be grouped into stacks and respect the ‘this side up’ constraint. The primary objective is to minimize the volume of shipped containers. The smallest volume container may be left behind for the next shipment and is excluded from the main objective. Nevertheless, only a limited percentage of each product may be packed into this container. Additionally, a set of secondary objectives is considered. This work presents a decomposition approach embedded in a multi-phase heuristic for the problem. Feasible solutions are generated quickly, and subsequently improved by local search and post-processing procedures. Experiments revealed that the approach generates optimal solutions for two instances, in addition to good quality solutions for those remaining from the Renault set. The algorithmic contribution is, however, not restricted to the Renault instances. Experiments on less constrained container loading instances from the literature demonstrate the approach’s general applicability and competitiveness.}

It has been recognized as a powerful technique for the quantitative analysis of complex construction operations. However, current DES modelling strategies/frameworks implicitly rely on queuing structures which are too rigid to easily describe systems with complex behaviour common in construction, e.g., multi-tasking resources and/or role changes of entities. Queuing networks are one of the most common elements of DES systems and have been used to model a wide range of problems, but they lack the generality to easily model the complex decision mechanisms required to, e.g., efficiently multi-task or dynamically determine the best role for an entity. This research proposes a new modelling approach for construction that replaces Queue-Based (QB) DES, with its implicit queuing network control, with Non-Queue-Based (NQB) DES that explicitly defines the decision mechanisms of a model. It utilises a new conceptual modelling paradigm for simulation, Hierarchical Control Conceptual Modelling, which was developed to address similar issues with control mechanisms in health care simulation. This new approach is especially beneficial for the construction industry where determining effective decision making mechanisms is of significant importance for optimising, e.g., logistics and resource utilisation. This research investigates the benefits of the proposed approach for DES models in construction by investigating three earthmoving case studies. Although the scope of this research is limited to DES modelling in construction, the outcomes of the proposed NQB paradigm in construction translate to other domains that utilise DES for solving complex problems.}

abstract = {Objective
To determine the role of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in prognosticating survival outcomes in patients with advanced/metastatic urothelial bladder cancer.
Methods
We retrospectively reviewed 84 patients undergoing radical cystectomy (RC) for UCB from January 2002 to June 2012. NLR was computed (median: 5 days) prior to surgery. No patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. NLR was analyzed as a continuous variable and a cut-off point of 2.7 was obtained, with a statistical receiver operating characteristics of 0.74. Kaplan–Meier curves, multivariate Cox proportional hazard and logistics regression models were used to predict NLR association with survival outcomes.
Results
The median follow-up period was 30.1 months (range: 3.2–161.7) owing to high recurrence rate and subsequent mortalities, compared to the median 64.7 months in patients alive at the end of study period. NLR ≥2.7 was associated with worse survival outcomes (5-year disease-specific survival: 22% vs 58%, p = 0.017, 95%CI: 1.193–6.009; 5-year overall survival: 23% vs 60%, p = 0.008, 95%CI: 1.322–6.147). Furthermore, on multivariate analyses, higher NLR was independently associated with higher recurrence rate (p = 0.007, HR =6.999, 95%CI: 1.712–28.606), higher T staging (p = 0.021, HR = 3.479, 95%CI: 1.212–9.990) and lymph node involvement (p = 0.009, HR = 4.534, 95%CI: 1.465–14.034).
Conclusion
This study suggests that NLR can be an inexpensive novel factor for patients risk stratification pre-operatively. This improves patient counseling and identifies patients who may benefit from multimodal treatment.}

abstract = {Objective
Progressive cost containment has resulted in a growing interest for fast-track cardiac surgery. Ventilation time and length of stay (LOS) in the intensive care unit (ICU) are important factors in patient turnover, a more efficient use of resources, and early patient mobilization. However, LOS in ICU is not an objective measure because, in addition to medical factors, patient discharge may be guided by logistics and policy, and thus more objective measures are warranted. The authors hypothesized that remifentanil compared with sufentanil would reduce ventilation time and LOS in the ICU and that remifentanil would have beneficial effects on the overall quality of recovery.
Design
A randomized, prospective study.
Participants
Sixty patients scheduled for elective coronary artery bypass grafting with or without aortic valve replacement.
Setting
A university hospital.
Interventions
Patients were assigned randomly to receive either remifentanil or sufentanil combined with propofol.
Measurements and Main Results
Patients with ejection fraction<0.3, myocardial infarction within the last 4 weeks, diabetes, and severe pulmonary or arterial hypertension were excluded. The primary outcome variables were ventilation time and time to eligibility of discharge from the cardiac recovery unit. Secondary outcomes were actual LOS in the cardiac recovery unit and quality of recovery. The groups were comparable in selected demographics and perioperative parameters. There were no differences in ventilation time or eligible ICU discharge time between the groups. Remifentanil patients received more morphine than did the sufentanil patients during recovery (20 mg v 10 mg; p = 0.040). No difference was found in pharmacologic support or use of a pacemaker.
Conclusion
In a fast-track protocol, remifentanil did not seem to be superior to a standard moderate- to high-dose sufentanil regimen.}

Applying a multi-objective optimization model to high-resolution spatial data, potential tradeoffs among the objectives of minimizing feedstock costs, GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions, and soil erosion were identified for a set of conversion facilities on an efficient frontier. The tradeoff relationship was primarily driven by the type of agricultural land converted to switchgrass. Hay and pasture lands were more cost effective but resulted in higher soil carbon losses and soil erosion after being converted to switchgrass. Converting crop lands reduced GHG emissions and soil erosion but caused higher feedstock cost primarily due to the higher opportunity cost of land use. The respective average costs of abating GHG emissions and soil erosion on the efficient frontier were $2378 Mg−1 and $10 Mg−1. The compromise solution conversion facility site generated 63% higher feedstock cost compared to the cost minimizing location, while reducing soil erosion by 70 fold and diminishing GHG emissions by 27%. Reducing soil erosion may be a more cost effective environmental criterion than reducing GHG emissions in developing a sustainable switchgrass supply chain in Tennessee.}

The performance (entrainment ratio) and flow phenomena of the two-stage ejector were predicted by numerical studies using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to find the best design parameters for a range of operating conditions. Simulation results showed that (1) when secondary flow pressure is constant, the critical back pressure increases with the increase of primary flow pressure, while the maximum entrainment ratio decreases with the increase of primary flow pressure; (2) when primary flow pressure is constant, both maximum entrainment ratio and critical back pressure increases with the increase of secondary flow pressure; and (3) when secondary flow pressure and outflow pressure are constant, the two-stage ejector has an optimum entrainment ratio value with the increase of primary flow pressure, and that the optimum entrainment ratios of 0.0736, 0.0761 and 0.0813 can be achieved when saturated temperature is at −22°C, −20°C, −18°C, respectively.

In 2014–2015, a 12-month project was implemented by a food bank in central Florida in four privately-owned ECE programs. An explanatory sequential design of a mixed-methods evaluation approach was utilized, including a pre-post menu analysis comparing parent-prepared meals to the catered meals, and stakeholder interviews to determine benefits and barriers. The menu analysis of lunches showed daily reductions in calories, fat, and saturated fat, but an increase in sodium in catered meals when compared to parent-prepared meals. Interviews with ECE directors, teachers, parents, and food bank project staff, identified several benefits of the catered meals, including healthfulness of meals, convenience to parents, and the ECE program's ability to market this meal service. Barriers of the catered meals included the increased cost to parents, transportation and delivery logistics, and change from a 5 to a 2-week menu cycle during summer food service. This pilot demonstrated potential feasibility of a food bank-ECE program partnership, by capitalizing on the food bank's existing facilities and culinary programming, and interest in implementing strategies focused on younger children. The food bank has since leveraged lessons learned and expanded to additional ECE programs.}

Each municipality has adopted different institutional arrangements to meet the responsibility shared by the State, industries, and consumers to operate public policies in this field. The consequence has been an inefficient recycling rate, high costs, and the exclusion of waste collectors from the official system. Therefore, the objectives of this study are as follows: (i) to submit a sustainable institutional arrangement based on cooperation between agents, with an intensive use of information technology and logistics and (ii) to assess the economic-financial feasibility of the model. The research method was based on a multilevel, interdisciplinary and systemic analytical structure for the study of path-dependent processes, proposed by Hoff (2011), associated to critical moment identification approach from Collier & Collier (1991). In addition, an economic valuation model based on discounted cash flow was used. The path dependence analysis reveals the following determinants of this situation: recent legislation; the existence of socially excluded collectors; contractual formats in public-private partnerships; and the need to raise citizens' awareness of their co-responsibility regarding environmental education. In this scenario, the alternative found by the actors is a social business that is inclusive for those at the Bottom of the Pyramid (BoP) and decentralised in micro-cooperatives with different forms of relationship with public authorities. Different from what the experiments indicate, the economic and financial viability of the model, in addition to the environmental, social, and legal benefits, are confirmed.}

Gasification is an attractive thermochemical conversion technology due to its flexibility in the product gas end-use. The aim of this paper is to investigate the impact of torrefaction on the gasification performance of a softwood (spruce) and a hardwood (ash). Spruce and ash were torrefied at 260 and 280 °C, and at 250 and 265 °C, respectively, and pelletized. All feedstocks were gasified at 850 °C and atmospheric pressure under oxygen-steam circulating fluidized bed gasification conditions, with magnesite as bed material and with an equivalence ratio (ER) of 0.3 and a steam-to-biomass mass ratio (SBR) of 1.0. Only the torrefied feedstocks were gasified varying ER and SBR values. The results show that torrefaction affected the gasification performance of both feedstocks leading to decreasing the cold gas and carbon conversion efficiencies. For spruce, torrefaction did not affect the permanent gas composition but led to a decrease of the total tar content for both spruce 260 and spruce 280. For ash, torrefaction resulted in decreasing the CH4 volume fraction, and increasing the H2 volume fraction and the total tar content for both torrefaction temperatures. Varying the ER and SBR affected only the Class 3 tars of ash 250. Conclusively, torrefaction of spruce and ash did not offer substantial benefits on the gasification performance under the investigated conditions. It is suggested that research of torrefied wood gasification includes feedstock's chemical analysis and characterization of products obtained under fast devolatilization conditions.}

We also reviewed how procurement decisions are made within immunization programs. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with 158 immunization stakeholders in Brazil, China, India, Peru, the Philippines, and Tanzania. Interviewees included national decision-makers and advisors involved in vaccine-purchasing decisions (n=30), national Expanded Programme on Immunization managers (n=6), and health and logistics personnel at national, subnational, and health-facility levels (n=122). Immunization stakeholders at all levels of the supply chain valued vaccine product attributes that prevent heat damage, decrease vaccine wastage, and simplify delivery. Minimizing the time required to prepare a dose is especially valued by those closest to the work of actually administering vaccines. Respondents appreciated the benefits of lower-multidose presentations on reducing wastage but seemed to prefer single-dose vials even more. They also expressed concern about the need for training and the potential for confusion and vial contamination if opened vials of liquid preservative-free vaccines are not handled properly. Procurement decision-making processes varied widely between countries, though most relied heavily on international agencies and vaccine manufacturers for information.}

abstract = {Introduction/Background
Disability following traumatic brain injury (TBI) is multidimensional, affecting those injured and their family members. The family as a whole is seldom recognized as an arena for rehabilitation efforts. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of an eight-session, manualized multidisciplinary family-centred rehabilitation intervention for families facing TBI, aimed at improving individual and family functioning. We evaluated the families’ willingness to participate; the appropriateness of inclusion criteria; the need for cultural adjustment of the intervention; the collaboration with municipal health care service and the leadership structure of the sessions; and the appropriateness of the selected self-reported questionnaires for data collection.
Material and method
Two families, six people, participated in this non-randomized feasibility study of the intervention arm of a full-scale RCT, conducted at the University Hospital in Oslo, Norway (ClinicalTrial.gov #NCT03000400). The study was performed in close collaboration with a municipal health care service. Pre-defined success criteria were determined prior to conducting the feasibility study. The evaluation of these criteria was based on the families’ feedback regarding acceptability of the intervention, the self-report measures and the experiences of the group facilitators conducting the intervention.
Results
The pre-defined succes criteria were fulfilled. Both families completed all eight sessions of the intervention. Minor cultural differences were detected, however, the topics and strategies covered in the intervention were perceived as relevant and recognizable. Some challenges emerged and were discussed before commencing the full-scale RCT. The challenges were related to the logistics regarding the delivery of the intervention. This pertained to keeping an acceptable level of burden of participation for the families and the collaborating municipal health professionals, and making the necessary adjustments of the intervention to suit the families’ unique needs.
Conclusion
The family-centred intervention and trial procedures were feasible. A pragmatic approach is considered necessary when commencing the full-scale RCT.}

abstract = {Freight transportation and logistics act as the artery of the national economy. With a booming economy, China's freight transport sector has experienced dramatic growth in recent decades and has become a key driving force of China's CO2 emissions. Therefore, effective and efficient mitigation policies in the freight transport sector are critical for China to promote CO2 emission mitigation strategies. In contrast to other countries, China's challenge stems not only from technical issues but also from regional socioeconomic disparities, which in turn require the implementation of locally oriented policies. For this reason, an analysis based on regional disparity is of vital importance for future policy making. However, to date, there have been few pertinent studies on the freight transportation sector. To fill this gap, this paper aims to conduct an in-depth comparative study of CO2 emission characteristics and the driving forces in the freight transport sector in China's three regions (covering 31 provinces) from 1990 to 2007. The log mean Divisia index method (LMDI) is employed to analyse the driving forces, and the Gini coefficient is used to investigate regional inequity. Additionally, regional disparity is explored in-depth based on the analytical results and practical concerns. The results highlight that economic structure is a key driving force for emissions change and reveal significant regional disparity and inequity in freight transport emissions. The results are critical for future policy-making to address regional concerns.}

abstract = {Objectives
This study is to evaluate the dental arch relationship and palatal morphology of unilateral cleft lip and palate patients by using EUROCRAN index, and to assess the factors that affect them using multivariate statistical analysis.
Method
A total of one hundred and seven patients from age five to twelve years old with non-syndromic unilateral cleft lip and palate were included in the study. These patients have received cheiloplasty and one stage palatoplasty surgery but yet to receive alveolar bone grafting procedure. Five assessors trained in the use of the EUROCRAN index underwent calibration exercise and ranked the dental arch relationships and palatal morphology of the patients' study models. For intra-rater agreement, the examiners scored the models twice, with two weeks interval in between sessions. Variable factors of the patients were collected and they included gender, site, type and, family history of unilateral cleft lip and palate; absence of lateral incisor on cleft side, cheiloplasty and palatoplasty technique used. Associations between various factors and dental arch relationships were assessed using logistic regression analysis.
Result
Dental arch relationship among unilateral cleft lip and palate in local population had relatively worse scoring than other parts of the world. Crude logistics regression analysis did not demonstrate any significant associations among the various socio-demographic factors, cheiloplasty and palatoplasty techniques used with the dental arch relationship outcome.
Conclusions
This study has limitations that might have affected the results, example: having multiple operators performing the surgeries and the inability to access the influence of underlying genetic predisposed cranio-facial variability. These may have substantial influence on the treatment outcome. The factors that can affect unilateral cleft lip and palate treatment outcome is multifactorial in nature and remained controversial in general.}

Whilst inspection and monitoring processes are established vehicles for their ‘control’, the procedures involved are often process driven, time consuming, and resource intensive. Paradoxically therefore, they can impinge upon the broader aspects of project time, cost and quality outcomes. Acknowledging this means appreciating concatenation effects such as the potential for litigation, impact on other processes and influence on stakeholders’ perceptions—that in turn, can impede progress and stifle opportunities for process optimisation or innovation. That is, opportunities relating to for example, logistics, carbon reduction, health and safety, efficiency, asset underutilisation and efficient labour distribution. This study evaluates these kinds of challenge from a time, cost and quality perspective, with a focus on identifying opportunities for process innovation and optimisation. It reviews—within the construction domain—state of the art technologies that support optimal use of artificial intelligence, cybernetics and complex adaptive systems. From this, conceptual framework is proposed for development of real-time intelligent observational platform supported by advanced intelligent agents, presented for discussion. This platform actively, autonomously and seamlessly manages intelligent agents (Virtual Reality cameras, Radio-Frequency Identification RFID scanners, remote sensors, etc.) in order to identify, report and document ‘high risk’ defects. Findings underpin a new ontological model that supports ongoing development of a dynamic, self-organised sensor (agent) network, for capturing and reporting real-time construction site data. The model is a ‘stepping stone’ for advancement of independent intelligent agents, embracing sensory and computational support, able to perform complicated (previously manual) tasks that provide optimal, dynamic, and autonomous management functions.}

Logistics companies often consider electric vehicles as too costly compared to vehicles powered by combustion engines. Research within the body of the current literature suggests that increasing the driven mileage can enhance the competitiveness of electric freight vehicles. In this paper we develop a numeric simulation approach to analyze the cost-optimal balance between a high utilization of medium-duty electric vehicles – which often have low operational costs – and the common requirement that their batteries will need expensive replacements. Our work relies on empirical findings of the real-world energy consumption from a large German field test with medium-duty electric vehicles. Our results suggest that increasing the range to the technical maximum by intermediate (quick) charging and multi-shift usage is not the most cost-efficient strategy in every case. A low daily mileage is more cost-efficient at high energy prices or consumptions, relative to diesel prices or consumptions, or if the battery is not safeguarded by a long warranty. In practical applications our model may help companies to choose the most suitable electric vehicle for the application purpose or the optimal trip length from a given set of options. For policymakers, our analysis provides insights on the relevant parameters that may either reduce the cost gap at lower daily mileages, or increase the utilization of medium-duty electric vehicles, in order to abate the negative impact of urban road freight transport on the environment.}

abstract = {Introduction
While planning an immunization campaign in settings where public health interventions are subject to politically motivated resistance, designing context-based social mobilization strategies is critical to ensure community acceptability. In preparation for an Oral Cholera Vaccine campaign implemented in Nampula, Mozambique, in November 2016, we assessed potential barriers and levers for vaccine acceptability.
Methods
Questionnaires, in-depth interviews, and focus group discussions, as well as observations, were conducted before the campaign. The participants included central and district level government informants (national immunization program, logistics officers, public health directors, and others), community leaders and representatives, and community members.
Results
During previous well chlorination interventions, some government representatives and health agents were attacked, because they were believed to be responsible for spreading cholera instead of purifying the wells. Politically motivated resistance to cholera interventions resurfaced when an OCV campaign was considered. Respondents also reported vaccine hesitancy related to experiences of problems during school-based vaccine introduction, rumors related to vaccine safety, and negative experiences following routine childhood immunization. Despite major suspicions associated with the OCV campaign, respondents’ perceived vulnerability to cholera and its perceived severity seem to override potential anticipated OCV vaccine hesitancy.
Discussion
Potential hesitancy towards the OCV campaign is grounded in global insecurity, social disequilibrium, and perceived institutional negligence, which reinforces a representation of estrangement from the central government, triggering suspicions on its intentions in implementing the OCV campaign. Recommendations include a strong involvement of community leaders, which is important for successful social mobilization; representatives of different political parties should be equally involved in social mobilization efforts, before and during campaigns; and public health officials should promote other planned interventions to mitigate the lack of trust associated with perceived institutional negligence. Successful past initiatives include public intake of purified water or newly introduced medication by social mobilizers, teachers or credible leaders.}

The study presents an analysis of the initiative’s origins in the neoliberalization of Brazilian planning in 1990s; the characteristics of its first round of cross-border infrastructure investments during the 2000–2010 period and its unaltered incorporation into the UNASUR institution, following South America’s recent post-neoliberal transition. The paper conceptualizes IIRSA’s spatial planning framework of ‘integration and development axes’ as an enduring form of neoliberal territorial design. By prioritising public investment in logistics corridors, IIRSA has privileged the global competitiveness of select export sectors over all other infrastructure provision and macro-regional planning considerations. It also aggravates geographically uneven development and fails to reflect extensive urbanization dynamics. The analysis is supported by archival research, a careful reading of policy documents and primary fieldwork conducted in the borderland Brazilian state of Roraima which illustrates the socio-spatial impacts that IIRSA has produced on the ground through its selective roadway development and lack of comprehensive planning in the Guianese Shield Axis – the designated corridor with the lowest level of investment. In addition to presenting a comprehensive empirical assessment of IIRSA, the paper aims to contribute to the literature on the variegated geographies of neoliberalism and emerging debates on planetary urbanization by emphasizing the ways in which state intervention (re)shapes extensive networked infrastructures, which, in turn, condition urbanization processes and inter-urban relations. The paper’s conclusion includes policy recommendations and suggestions for future research.}

abstract = {In the growing trend of globalization, the logistics and transportation play the key role in many industries. Products are shipped from one country to another. The heart of this transportation is the port, where large quantities of goods are imported and exported on daily bases. Applying Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to port warehouses is the main area of this work. Centralized warehouse management systems are prone to a single point of failure problem and are not fault tolerant. They have also limited scalability. Another issue is that the port warehouses may run by different companies and the privacy of the detailed product information must be preserved. In this paper, we design an IoT based architecture for warehouse management, according to the facts gathered from the Khorramshahr port. The main issues that this paper tries to address are: scalability, fault tolerance, and privacy. The devised architecture is named Khorramshahr (named after the name of the port). The tailored version of Chord architecture is exploited for a Distributed Hash Table (DHT), which inherits the required scalability and fault tolerance. According to the devised architecture, each company can solely manage its dedicated nodes and preserve the privacy. To boost the lookup process the design is enhanced by Bloom filter and Quotient filter. Moreover, to gain performance the architecture uses a hybrid approach, which combines both the client server and the peer to peer paradigms. To evaluate the performance, the DHT of the architecture is simulated by OMNet++ and OverSim. The simulation results show that by the scaling the number of terminals from 25 to 250 the access time for an item increases only 38%. Besides, the increase in the number of requests from 10,000 to 50,000 depicts 5% and 10% improvement respectively for the lookup message latency compared to the ODSA. The simulation results also exhibit lower false positive rate for the Quotient filter approach, which makes it the first implementation candidate. Only in cases with strict constraints on memory consumption the Bloom filter approach is favored.}

However, the sacredness of religious festivals calls for gatherings of millions of pilgrims within a limited space and duration. The annual Ratha Yatra at Puri is an event that is manually controlled by the logistics provided by the district authorities. Pedestrian crowds move along a 3-kilometre stretch of the road to witness the manual dragging of three chariots for around 4h. The objective of this paper is to understand crowd characteristics at a particular location during the event and suggest for crowd evacuation in emergencies through identified exit routes. In Ratha Yatra 2015, a single-camera video recording of the event was performed from an overhead location. The individual video frames were perspective-rectified and analyzed to detect human shapes and extract parameters of crowd density, flow, and speed. The results were simulated through an agent-based model to trigger an evacuation process at critical crowd densities. A similar approach using multiple cameras at multiple locations in a large mobility network can provide a decision-making tool to adopt safety measures in mass gatherings.}

In particular, they aim to promote social learning on a broad set of sustainability values, beyond a focus on “fresh and healthy food” only, which characterizes many of the individual consumer oriented local food chain initiatives. This paper analyses the governance features of such local food buying groups by comparing 104 groups in five cities in Belgium. We find that the social networking activities of these groups, as compared to the social enterprise activities, have led to establish specific governance mechanisms. Whereas the main focus of the social enterprise activities is the organisation of the food provisioning logistics, the focus of the social network activities is the sharing of resources with other sustainable food initiatives, dissemination of information and broader discussion on sustainability issues.}

The model discovered using process discovery techniques and the process as perceived by users will always differ in some ways and to some extents. In particular, less structured process, such as operational process in business and manufacturing, often result overly confusing, spaghetti-like, process models caused by the inherent complexity of the process. As a result, the mined model has many limitations for providing the users with explicit knowledge that can be directly used to influence behavior for the user’s interest. Explicit knowledge, as later called by actionable knowledge, is an important representation on measuring the interestingness of mined patterns. This actionable knowledge, which is incorporated with users’ background knowledge and based on some notions of actionable rules, can result an actionable process model. Undoubtedly, domain experts, who know the process well, play a key role to enhance the mined model into an actionable model by their involvements during the discovery process. This paper presents a discovery method to obtain an actionable process model that is based on both the event relation in the log and users’ knowledge to improve the incompatibility of the traditional process mining approaches. Users can set their knowledge in terms of constraints. Unlike the existing approach, the proposed approach synthesizes the activity proximity and attempts to extract behavior satisfied by the constraints which may be hidden in the event logs for resulting an actionable process model. In addition, the proposed method is used in order to achieve a sound process model when the existence of the constraints does not satisfy the workflow soundness property. The method was implemented in the ProM framework and tested on a real process.}

In the classical bin packing problem, we are given a list of real numbers in (0,1] and the goal is to place them in a minimum number of bins so that no bin holds numbers summing to more than 1. The problem is extremely important in practice and finds numerous applications in scheduling, routing and resource allocation problems. Theoretically the problem has rich connections with discrepancy theory, iterative methods, entropy rounding and has led to the development of several algorithmic techniques. In this survey we consider approximation and online algorithms for several classical generalizations of bin packing problem such as geometric bin packing, vector bin packing and various other related problems. There is also a vast literature on mathematical models and exact algorithms for bin packing. However, this survey does not address such exact algorithms. In two-dimensional geometric bin packing, we are given a collection of rectangular items to be packed into a minimum number of unit size square bins. This variant has a lot of applications in cutting stock, vehicle loading, pallet packing, memory allocation and several other logistics and robotics related problems. In d-dimensional vector bin packing, each item is a d-dimensional vector that needs to be packed into unit vector bins. This problem is of great significance in resource constrained scheduling and in recent virtual machine placement in cloud computing. We also consider several other generalizations of bin packing such as geometric knapsack, strip packing and other related problems such as vector scheduling, vector covering etc. We survey algorithms for these problems in offline and online setting, and also mention results for several important special cases. We briefly mention related techniques used in the design and analysis of these algorithms. In the end we conclude with a list of open problems.}

abstract = {There has been growing interest in establishing food waste prevention and recovery programs throughout the world. The drive to target food waste stems from increasing concerns about resource conservation, food security, food waste's environmental and economic costs, and a general trend in the waste management industry to transition to more sustainable practices. Here the drivers of residential, institutional, and commercial food waste generation in developed countries, particularly in the U.S., are explored. The impacts of food system modernization on food waste generation are examined, including impacts related to food system industrialization, urbanization, globalization, and economic growth. Socio-demographic, cultural, political, and economic drivers of food waste are described with emphasis on how food waste perspectives may vary globally. Specific behaviors and attitudes which result from many of these waste drivers are then discussed. The examination of the range of food wastage drivers are used to provide insight into the best policy approaches to sustainably manage food waste. Food waste prevention policies are placed in context of the waste generating behaviors and attitudes that they address. A review of important background information on food waste is also provided, including definitions of key terms, food waste history, quantities of food waste generated, and the importance of food waste prevention for sustainability, as this information is all critical for effective policy development.}

abstract = {Objectives
The 2014–15 Ebola outbreak in West Africa highlighted the challenges many hospitals face when preparing for the potential emergence of highly contagious diseases. This study examined the experiences of frontline health care professionals in an Australian hospital during the outbreak, with a focus on participant views on information, training and preparedness, to inform future outbreak preparedness planning.
Study design
Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 21 healthcare professionals involved in Ebola preparedness planning, at a hospital in Australia.
Methods
The data were systematically coded to discover key themes in participants' accounts of Ebola preparedness.
Results
Three key themes identified were: 1) the impact of high volumes of—often inconsistent—information, which shaped participants' trust in authority; 2) barriers to engagement in training, including the perceived relative risk Ebola presented; and finally, 3) practical and environmental impediments to preparedness.
Conclusions
These clinicians' accounts of Ebola preparedness reveal a range of important factors which may influence the relative success of outbreak preparedness and provide guidance for future responses. In particular, they illustrate the critical importance of clear communication and guidelines for staff engagement with, and implementation of training. An important outcome of this study was how individual assessments of risk and trust are produced via, and overlap with, the dynamics of communication, training and environmental logistics. Consideration of the dynamic ways in which these issues intersect is crucial for fostering an environment that is suitable for managing an infectious threat such as Ebola.}

abstract = {In New Zealand, 30% of plantation forests are small-scale (<1000 ha) and knowledge of these forests, especially those less than 100 ha, is limited. These forests are expected to comprise more than 40% of the total harvest volume by 2020, so it is critical to understand the small-scale forest resource in order to plan effectively for marketing, harvesting, logistics and transport capacity. A remote sensing solution to small-scale forest description is necessary because conducting a comprehensive ground-based survey of those patchy forests is impractical. However, the utility of remote sensing prediction techniques for application in small-scale forests is unknown. This research evaluated two parametric models (multiple linear regression and seemingly unrelated regression) and two non-parametric models (k-Nearest Neighbour and Random Forest) models to predict stand variables (mean top height, basal area, volume and stand age) using model inputs including RapidEye-derived metrics and LiDAR-derived metrics. LiDAR-derived metrics were better at predicting all forest stand variables relative to RapidEye metrics. Combining LiDAR metrics with RapidEye metrics did not improve variable prediction results (on average 0.2% reduction in RMSE). Non-parametric models and parametric models performed similarly. Of all approaches tested in this study, multiple linear regression (MLR) using LiDAR-derived metrics was deemed to be the best performing modelling approach for predicting stand variables for small-scale plantation forests in New Zealand. MLR predicted mean top height (MTH) with a root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of 1.81 m, basal area (BA) with an RMSE of 9.92 m2  ha−1, stand volume with an RMSE of 94.93 m3  ha−1 and age with an RMSE of 2.17 years.}
