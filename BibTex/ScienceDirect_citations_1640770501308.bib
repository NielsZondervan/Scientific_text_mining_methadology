abstract = {Traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients are known to have a high rate of venous thromboembolism (VTE), and additional neuromuscular blockade or barbiturate coma therapy has the theoretical risk of exacerbating baseline hemostasis and elevating the incidence of thromboembolic events. We conducted a single-institution retrospective review of patients surviving severe TBI, as determined by need for intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring, who further required paralytics or barbiturate therapy to maintain ICP control. Patients were administered VTE prophylaxis as clinically appropriate. Predictors for VTE were subsequently determined with univariate and logistic multivariate regression analyses. The main cohort includes 144 patients, 34 of whom received pharmaceutical immobilization for ICP control. Mean ISS and GCS at intake were 31.9 and 5.2, respectively. Among those receiving vs not-receiving paralytics and/or barbiturate therapy, there was a statistical difference of 12/34 (35.3%) vs 18/110 (16.4%, p = 0.0280) in VTE events, at a mean time greater than two weeks from the time of trauma. Multivariate logistics regression indicated 3.2 times increased odds of developing a VTE (log odds = 1.17, p = 0.023). No pediatric patients were positive for an event (0/12 vs 7/22, p = 0.0356), and infections were only documented among those with VTE (0/22 vs 4/12, p = 0.0107). Overall, paralytics and barbiturate therapy were correlated with a higher incidence of VTE among TBI patients. Although the need for ICP control will outweigh an increase in thromboembolic risk, there is value for increased surveillance and screening during the prolonged inpatient stay of these patients.}

abstract = {Due to the awareness of environmental issues and the dwindling natural virgin resources, many company have attempted to increase the sustainability of their activities. One efficient way to pursue company’s sustainability is incorporation of consideration of corporate social responsibility (CSR) to designing a closed loop supply chain (CLSC). CLSC is now a revenue opportunity and low environmental emission application for manufacturers instead of classical cost-minimization approach. Recently, some governmental legislation forced producers to take care of End of Life (EOL) products. Electrical goods contains mandatory requirements on collection, recycling, and recovery in some country. A supply chain, in its classical form (forward supply chain), is a combination of processes to minimize cost by fulfill customers’ requests. Reverse logistics plan and control EOL product from the point of consumption to the point of origin for the purpose of recapturing value or proper disposal. If we consider forward and reverse supply chains simultaneously, the result network will construct a CLSC. This paper developed a mathematical model to consider corporate social responsibility activities in CLSC. This research formulates a multi-objective problem for closed loop supply chain (CLSC) design by incorporating CSR. Moreover the model, in addition to pursue objectives that maximize profit, minimize environmental emission, and maximize CSR objective, provides a range of strategic decision solutions for decision makers to select plan for a CLSC incorporating CSR. A proposed multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model was solved. A numerical example was used to validate the potential application of the proposed model.}

abstract = {The scope of the assembly line balancing problem in research is clear, with well-defined sets of assumptions, parameters, and objective functions. In application, these borders are frequently transgressed. Many of these deviations are internal to the assembly line balancing problem itself, arising from any of the physical or technological features in modern assembly lines. Other issues are founded in the tight coupling of assembly line balancing with external production planning and management problems, as assembly lines are at the intersection of multiple related problems in job sequencing, part flow logistics, worker safety, and quality. General assembly line balancing is devoted to studying the solution techniques necessary to model these applied line balancing problems. This article presents a complex line balancing problem based on the real production environment of our industrial partner, featuring several extensions for task-to-task relationships, station characteristics limiting assignment, and parallel worker zoning interactions. A heuristic, combining rank-position-weighting, last-fit-improvement and iterative blocking scheme, and an integer program that can manage multiple constraint types simultaneously, are developed. An experiment is conducted testing each of these new solution methods upon a battery of testbed problems, measuring solution quality, runtime, and achievement of feasibility. Results indicate that the integer programming model provides a viable solution method for those industries with access to commercial solvers.}

While many efforts have contributed to the fundamental success of atmospheric applications of multicopters in the past, several challenges remain, including limited measurable variables, possible response-delay in real-time observations, insufficient measurement accuracy, endurance of harsh conditions and tolerance towards interferences. To address these challenges and further fortify the applicability in diversified research disciplines, this study developed an optimized multicopter UAV sounding technique (MUST). The MUST serves as an integrated platform by combining self-developed algorithms, optimized working environments for sensors/monitors, and retrofitted sampling devices to probe a comprehensive set of atmospheric variables. These variables of interest include meteorological parameters (temperature, relative humidity, pressure, wind direction and speed), the chemical composition (speciated VOCs, CO, CO2, CH4, CO2 isotopologues, O3, PM2.5, and black carbon), and the radiation flux, as well as visible and thermal images. The aim of this study is to achieve the following objectives: 1. to easily probe a comprehensive set of near-surface atmospheric variables; 2. to improve data quality by correcting for sensors’ delay in real-time observations and minimizing environmental interferences; and 3. to enhance the versatility and applicability of aerial measurements by incorporating necessary hardware and software. Field launching cases from the surface to a maximum height of 1000 m were conducted to validate the robustness of the integrated MUST platform with sufficient speed, accuracy and resolution for the target variables.}

In these and other applications, it is critical to quantify the levels of not only viable but also non-viable cells. While traditional off-line cell-staining methods are available for counting of non-viable cells, many applications cannot periodically remove cells for their off-line analysis because of the risk of contamination or workflow logistics. Here we show in-situ label-free quantitation of viable and non-viable cells with multivariable multi-resonant sensors. We used Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells in suspension culture in single-use bioreactors as a representative example. The resonant sensor design strategy permitted enhanced sensor sensitivity versus conventional non-resonant measurements and probed the spectral dispersion of viable and non-viable cells with multiple resonances. These capabilities of label-free in-situ analysis of cell viability can be attractive in diverse cell applications such as cell suspensions, adhered cells, and their 3D assemblages.}

This solution would keep track of health history, birth records, ownership history and track location of each animal by using an electronic solar-powered tag instead of the current passive ear tags. This paper employs GPRS, GSM and the Google Earth function along with RFIDs to design an enhanced proposed enterprise system-architecture framework in the form of a business process model. Various areas such as e-health, e-commerce, and cloud-based manufacturing have been revolutionized by discoveries in digitized practices. Advancements in the Internet of things led to the advent of asset tracking systems, condition monitoring and various intelligent systems that exchange data over the cloud. Farmers are very vulnerable to stock theft, straying animals and high business risks due to poor animal health management practices. Existing tracking systems have high ownership costs since some of them rely on GSM network providers whose services are costly for farmers. Innovations in digitized systems continue to add more value to businesses and individuals across broad range sectors. Authors of this paper propose a low-cost intelligent animal tracking system for an African free-ranging environment. Economies worldwide are ever becoming digital and animal husbandry practices stand to benefit from this digitisation approach.}

We find that NSR transit numbers have generally been low (μ = 34 transits per year), varying between 71 transits per year (in 2013), 18 transits (in 2015, 2016), and 27 transits each in 2017 and 2018. On an aggregate basis, tankers and dry cargo ships have been the largest users of the NSR (123 and 122 transits respectively, accounting for 82% of all transits), followed by ice breakers, OSVs and SAR vessels (12% or 35 transits). Only 15 transits (5%) were by passenger, cruise and research ships followed by coastguard and fishing vessel (1%). Factors preventing its wider adoption include the comparatively lesser, but still existent presence of sea ice thus constituting a hazard to navigation, few cargo ports along the NSR, higher insurance premiums, inadequate coverage of charts, inadequate SAR facilities, the need for ice breaker assistance and resultant higher transit costs. Due to the presence of ice, NSR was open for navigation for < 155 days each year (132 days in 2018). Due to these pertinacious obstacles to safe navigation, the thinning of arctic ice has not resulted in waters sufficiently free of ice to enable safe commercially viable passage of commercial conventional cargo ships.}

In particular the today’s starting switches to electronic trucks/scooter lead to massive changes in the organization and planning in this field. Public funding or tax reduction for environment friendly solutions forces also the growth of new mobility and transportation services. However, the vast changes in this domain and the high number of innovations of new technologies and services leads also into a critical legal uncertainty. The clarification of a legal status for a new technology or service can become cost intensive in a dimension that in particular startups could not invest. In this paper we therefore introduce a new approach to identify and analyze legal conflicts based on a business model or plan against existing laws. The intention is that an early awareness of critical legal aspect could enable an early adoption of the planned service to ensure its legality. Our main contribution is distinguished in two parts. Firstly, a new Norm-graph visualization approach to show laws and legal aspects in an easier understandable manner. And secondly, a Visual Legal Analytics approach to analyze legal conflicts e.g. on the basis of a business plans. The Visual Legal Analytics approach aims to provide a visual analysis interface to validate the automatically identified legal conflicts resulting from the pre-processing stage with a graphical overview about the derivation down to the law roots and the option to check the original sources to get further details. At the end analyst can so verify conflicts as relevant and resolve it by advancing e.g. the business plan or as irrelevant. An evaluation performed with lawyers has proofed our approach.}

Significant research in time series forecasting techniques and a variety of forecasting methods are available in the market. However, selecting the most accurate forecasting model for a given time series has become a complicated decision. Prior studies of forecasting methods have used either in-sample or out-of-sample performance as the basis for model selection procedures, but typically fail to incorporate both in their decision-making framework. In this research, we develop an expert system for time series forecasting model selection, using both relative in-sample performance and out-of-sample performance simultaneously to train classifiers. These classifiers are employed to automatically select the best performing forecasting model without the need for decision-maker intervention. The new model selection scheme bridges the gap between using in-sample and out-of-sample performance separately. The best performing model on the validation set is not necessarily selected by the expert system, since both in-sample and out-of-sample information are essential in the selection process. The performance of the proposed expert system is tested using the monthly dataset from the M3-Competition, and the results demonstrate an overall minimum of 20% improvement in the optimality gap comparing to the train/validation method. The new forecasting expert system is also applied to a real case study dataset obtained from MonarchFx (a distributed logistics solutions provider). This result demonstrates a robust predictive capability with lower mean squared errors, which allows organizations to achieve a higher level of accuracy in demand forecasts.}

By investigating the economic precondition for bridging the energy efficiency gap, a behavioral change at the micro level among residents of Kumamoto is analyzed. A utility-based simulation model is used to estimate that 37,276 Kcal is required to achieve the utility level of 6966 for an ‘average person’ in Kumamoto. A reduction of 5300 Kcal is needed to improve the actual ECE of 0.187 to a maximum ECE of 0.218 for one person per day. This goal is achievable by decreasing car trips by 81.2%, increasing non-mobility goods by 7.7%, and increasing public transport trips by 419%. The change in consumption behaviors comes at an additional cost of over 485 Yen to support each person for one day. Although ECE and additional cost are negatively correlated, this relationship is weak and insignificant with a coefficient of 0.007. However, personal income is found to have a significant influence on additional cost, with a negative coefficient value of 0.453. Countermeasures for increasing the consumption of non-mobility goods are recommended, including improving the affordability and accessibility of non-mobility goods by controlling prices and developing advanced logistics. Financial support and subsidies for both residents and transport service providers are also suggested as an incentive to increase the use of energy-efficient modes of transport.}

If the optimization is carried out using mathematical instruments, the production costs are implemented in the form of a restriction. The functional form is critical not only to ensure accuracy but also to facilitate computing power and input data requirements. The present study documents the development of a cost function for fertilizer application. Three potential ways to address transportation costs within the whole cost function are observed: (i) calculating minimal transportation time using a “split delivery vehicle routing problem” (SDVRP), (ii) estimating transportation time using a regression model, and (iii) neglecting transport costs altogether. In Section 3, the costs of fertilizer application and their influence on the fertilizer application strategy are compared. Despite minimal differences in the application cost values, all methods lead to comparable results. A further investigation reveals additional factors that influence the reliability of decision-making, for example, price relations. The computational power and data input demands are explored as well. In this respect, the SDVRP method was identified as the most resource-demanding option. We conclude that the performance of the regression method is the most reliable for optimizing the fertilizer application strategy using mathematical instruments. The present study may support researchers focusing on farm logistics or related cost functions, such as spraying, sowing or manure application.}

abstract = {The transition of housing gestating sows from individual stalls to group pens allows for a greater freedom of movement and social interactions, but it comes with many challenges to ensure group cohesion and safety of all animals. Previous research on the behavior and welfare of group housed sows has predominately focused on aggression at mixing, feeding systems, and flooring type, with little information on association patterns within the pen. In order to examine the complex direct and indirect relationships among group housed sows, this study recorded dyadic associations (defined as resting in proximity, <1.5 m) among a subset of multiparous sows (n = 129) housed in the same dynamic group pen. Stochastic simulations were used to compare the association patterns observed to random permutations of association patterns given the pen logistics. For this study pen, 13.4 % of the dyads had significantly higher associations than we would expect under the null model of completely random lying patterns, while 43 % of dyads were never recorded to rest in proximity. Distinct subpopulations demonstrating clear preferences for different subareas of the gestation pen were also found. Younger sows demonstrated association preferences above and beyond what would be expected if there were only a mutual preference for a general area of the pen. The older sows, on the other hand, seldom formed strong associations, and their distribution within the pen appears to be driven by preferences for specific lying areas rather than for resting partners. Beyond this age dynamic, our results also indicated that sows that rested most often on the slatted floors, tended to be younger, smaller, had more severe lesions and had higher feed rank scores (i.e., ate last in the day) – all indicators of lower social rank – relative to the sows which were consistently recorded in the sow cubicles (i.e., concrete lying areas). While the results of this observational study have shed some light on the factors which influence positive-to-neutral social interactions amongst sows in group housed pens, we hope that they will ultimately serve as a jumping-off point for future experimental work capable of producing more comprehensive and conclusive insights into these important social dynamics.}

Organizations have issued guidance on coping with this shortage, including administering split-dose BCG such that one vial may treat up to three patients. However, logistical implementation of this strategy in a real-world setting is hampered by the recommendation to use BCG within 2 h of reconstitution. We assessed BCG viability in terms of colony-forming units (CFUs) and demonstrated that viability remained constant for at least 8 h after reconstitution (decline at 8 h of 9.1% for lot 1 [p =  0.3] and 4.8% for lot 2 [p =  0.2]). While the viability at 24 h was lower, it did not drop to a level below that of reducing the BCG dose to one-third (67% for lot 1 and 60% for lot 2) and remained close to 50% for at least 72 h. An in vitro model using co-culture of BCG and leukocytes with a BCG-sensitive cell line (RT4-V6) demonstrated no decrease in the cytotoxic potential of BCG at 72 h. In times of shortage, BCG vials may be split and administered for up to at least 8 h (or even 72 h) after reconstitution, allowing more patients to benefit from BCG while placing less strain on the logistics of clinical practice.
Patient summary
The current supply of and increased demand for bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), used in the treatment of bladder cancer, have led to repeated BCG shortages. One way to address this is to provide a reduced BCG dose to allow more patients to be treated. In this study we found that BCG viability remains clinically relevant up to 72 h after reconstitution, thus allowing for more patients to be treated from a single vial.}

HABs can pose severe threats to human health due to the release of dangerous toxins in fresh or marine water that can negatively affect public health, increase treatment costs for drinking water, and cause enormous economic loss in industries that depend on clean water. In this study, the effect of decisions made in the organic waste supply chain (SC) on reducing the potential for HABs is investigated by integrating three types of models: a SC optimization model, a nutrient transport model, and an algae growth model. This contribution presents a comprehensive spatio-temporal management strategy for short-term HAB reduction by adjusting components in the SC, including technologies, logistics, nutrient management plans (NMPs) or environmental costs, and seasonal waste storage planning. In addition, it is presented a case study of the Upper Yahara Watershed in the State of Wisconsin to illustrate the practicability of this modeling framework.}

abstract = {Nowadays, many organizations are trying to balance the social, environmental, and economic aspects of their supply chains to gain competitive advantages against their rivals and have a sustainable supply chain. Steel is one of the most critical raw materials practically used in every aspect of our life, directly or indirectly influencing the industry and economy of a country. The final products of the steel industry can be reused at the end of their lifecycle, making the principles of reverse logistics applicable in the supply chain and turning it to a closed-loop supply chain. In this research, a multi-objective linear mathematical model under uncertainty is developed to optimize a steel sustainable closed-loop supply chain. The existed uncertainty is modeled through a scenario-based method in the stochastic environment, and the proposed multi-objective model is developed following a fuzzy goal programming approach. A real case study is explored in one of the active steel supply chains in Iran to validate the model. The model optimizes total profit, energy, and water consumption, CO2 emission, job opportunity created, and lost working days through determining optimal production technology, whether retailers get changed to hybrid centers or not, and the flow of material and products. The final results show that a mere 1% decrease in the profit can alleviate the harmful environmental effects by 5%. Finally, several managerial implications derived from final results and sensitivity analysis are discussed to provide insights for industry leaders who desire to increase their profits with regard to environmental and social effects.}

abstract = {In recent years, fresh food e-commerce has developed rapidly and become a new strategic field for traditional e-commerce firms. Logistics is one of the bottlenecks in its development. Each type of fresh food has its own temperature requirements during transportation. In this paper, the multi-compartment vehicle routing problem with time window (MCVRPTW) arising in fresh food e-commerce is proposed to include the consideration of carbon emission. A variable neighborhood search (VNS) approach with the key steps of local search and shaking is proposed to solve the MCVRPTW formulation. For the VNS approach, three operators are used in the local search phase, and two kinds of operators based on path relinking are adopted in the shaking phase. Extensive efforts are made to verify the proposed approach. Firstly, the parameters are tuned based on Taguchi method. Secondly, the approach is compared with representative algorithms in the literature to solve VRPTW instances and MCVRPTW instances. For the VRPTW cases, VNS outperforms a well-known benchmark algorithm by 4–7%, and the overall average gap between the VNS solutions and the known best solutions is only 1.93%. For the MCVRPTW instances, VNS produces the same or improved “best solution” in the majority of the 24 instances with less than 30% of running time, compared with two existing MCVRPTW algorithms. Finally, VNS is employed to solve a real-world case, and the results show that the total cost of the solution is 36.38% lower than the actual operation. Overall, this study takes the minimum total of travel cost, fixed cost, refrigeration cost and carbon emission cost as the optimization objective, and the findings are conducive to reducing energy consumption and carbon emission in the fresh e-commerce delivery process.}

Moreover, existing travel data only include realized travel, not unmet need. Twenty-four original semi-structured interviews were conducted with women aged 25 years or older in Vermont USA to better understand the motivations and barriers of long-distance travel that cannot be fully explored in quantitative surveys. The relationship between travel, well-being, and social networks is also considered. Those interviewed indicated long-distance travel played a significant role in their lives by facilitating visits to friends and family, leisure, breaks from routine, and fulfilling personal obligations. As expected, long-distance travel was limited by cost as well as both household and work obligations. Physical limitations were noted as a barrier but the number of people raising fears about travel, being away from home, and travel logistics was unexpected. The interviews also revealed intercity travel as a symbol of social status which in turn created negative impacts for some. Latent demand for long-distance travel was common and larger than expected among the interviewees. Finally, results pointed to overlap between work and personal travel as well as a sense of obligation. While long-distance travel is often considered discretionary, this study suggests intercity non-discretionary personal trips as well as unmet demand merit future attention in both surveys and qualitative research.}

However, such operations have increased resource consumption and pollution production, causing more environmental damage. To address these issues, postponement strategies are adopted to enable responsive and more environmentally friendly supply chain operations. However, only a few studies on supply chain optimization considering postponement strategies and environmental issues have been conducted. It motivates this study to propose a mixed-integer model of an integrated green supply chain network (GSCN) for both single and multi-period planning horizons that incorporate postponement concept, and modularized products and processes. Using these models, various speculation strategies coupled with postponement strategies can be analyzed in configuring green supply chain system with mass customization principle subjected to various carbon tax and carbon cap policies under a global supply chain environment. Computational examples of a mass customization notebook computer supply chain show that postponing product differentiation reduces excessive production processes. As a result, the configured supply chain is able to comply with strict environmental policies with just a slight cost increase. This justifies postponement strategies application in configuring eco-efficient supply chain operations.}

The nanoMIP tagged with a redox probe, combines both recognition and reporting capabilities. The developed nanoMIP replaces enzyme-mediator pairs used in traditional biosensors thus, offering enhanced molecular recognition for insulin, improving performance in complex biological samples, and yielding high stability. Also, most of existing sensors show poor performance after storage. To improve costs of the logistics and avoid the need of cold storage in the chain supply, we developed an alternative to biorecognition system that relies on nanoMIP. NanoMIP were computationally designed using “in-silico” insulin epitope mapping and synthesized by solid phase polymerisation. The characterisation of the polymer nanoparticles was performed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), Fourier-transform Infrared (FT-IR) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The electrochemical sensor was developed by chemical immobilisation of the nanoMIP on screen printed platinum electrodes. The insulin sensor displayed satisfactory performances and reproducible results (RSD = 4.2%; n = 30) using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) in the clinically relevant concentration range from 50 to 2000 pM. The developed nanoMIP offers the advantage of large number of specific recognition sites with tailored geometry, as the resultant, the sensor showed high sensitivity and selectivity to insulin with a limit of detection (LOD) of 26 and 81 fM in buffer and human plasma, respectively, confirming the practical application for point of care monitoring. Moreover, the nanoMIP showed adequate storage stability of 168 days, demonstrating the robustness of sensor for several rounds of insulin analysis.}

The levels of pigments (chlorophyll a, b, total chlorophyll and carotenoids), chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters, and other physiological and biochemical indices, containing total protein measurements of H2O2, catalase (CAT), and malondialdehyde (MDA) under different treatment groups were measured to explain the physio-ecological mechanism of the effect of PAN and/or Cu2+ on the growth of C. pyrenoidosa. The results showed that PAN, Cu2+ and the combination of PAN and Cu2+ inhibited the growth of C. pyrenoidosa. Chlorophyll a and b decreased significantly with increasing levels of pollutants (PAN and/or Cu2+); however, the carotenoid levels increased with increasing levels of pollutants (PAN and/or Cu2+) for the first three cultivation days. The oxygen-evolving complexes (OECs) of C. pyrenoidosa had been damaged under Cu2+ pollution. The results also showed that CAT activity, MDA content and H2O2 activity of C. pyrenoidosa increased with increasing levels of pollutants (PAN and/or Cu2+); however, total protein content decreased with increasing levels of pollutants (PAN and/or Cu2+) at the first cultivation day. These results indicate that pollutants (PAN and/or Cu2+) are harmful to the growth of the C. pyrenoidosa population and negatively affect the levels and function of the pigments in C. pyrenoidosa by decreasing chlorophyll a and b levels, increasing carotenoid levels, and increasing antioxidant enzyme activity.}

The data obtained from food waste transport and anaerobic co-digestion process are used as input for LCA analysis. The aim of the methodology is to assess the environmental and economic benefit of the substitution of energy crops (like corn silage) with food waste in anaerobic digestion. Two approaches are adopted: consequential LCA and attributional LCA. Only one impact category is taken into account: climate change. This decision has been taken to focus on two decision making criteria (economic feasibility and GHG emissions reduction). The results show that a reduction of 42% in the carbon footprint of the electricity produced from the biogas plant can be obtained by substituting about 9900 t of corn silage with 6600 t of food waste. Through the combined use of economic analysis and consequential LCA it has been possible to identify an optimized scenario in which: food waste produced from food industries is collected and used to produce energy in Expired Food Energy chains (EFE), while the food obtained from supermarkets is used to promote charity initiatives in actions aiming at the Reduction of Expired Food waste (REF).}

abstract = {Over the last few years, there has been a clear evolution in the suppliers of the automotive industry due to constant demands imposed by OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers), systematically requiring an increase in the level of quality and competitiveness of products. The continuous requirement to increase productivity in this sector makes it necessary to modernize technology and the need to monitor all production at a distance, also making the manufacturing process more autonomous. However, more traditional companies in developing countries cannot move abruptly to an integrated production and management system. Thus, it is necessary to establish an industrial implementation strategy for this type of companies. The evolution of the work method on the factory shop-floor must be gradual so that there is a greater effectiveness in the change of working paradigm. This paper aims to establish a model of gradual implementation of industry 4.0 in SMEs currently working in a traditional way, so that workers can have the opportunity to evolve in their cognitive capacities with technological evolution, promoting a symbiosis between technological change and the change of mentality, habits of work and technological knowledge of the workers. In order to test the validity of the model, it was developed a case study, through its implementation in a components’ cutting process for the automotive industry. The progress should follow the whole procedure of assembling and shipping of the intermediate product in order to increase their reliability and monitoring. A production control system based on automation and information was created, which allows the product state to be known in real time, triggering the whole process of logistics and subsequent processing in a completely automatic way. After the implementation of this pilot system, it is much simpler to proceed with the training and technological updating of the workers regarding the following processes.}

This paper reviews the evolution of packaging over the last century through a compilation of scientific literature on e-commerce packaging focusing on its environmental side. The primary aims were to identify research gaps in e-commerce packaging and to propose new research lines aimed at reducing its environmental impact. A systematic search of abstracts was conducted to identify articles dealing with sustainability in e-commerce packaging in order to better understand changes in materials and formats, identify problems such as oversizing and allow prospective readers to become acquainted with the latest innovations in materials, sustainability and logistics. Based on existing research, packaging materials and technology evolved rapidly until the 1990s. Later, however, it has become increasingly difficult to further reduce their cost and environmental impact. Also, some packaging products continue to be made from non-renewable materials and thus restrict growth of e-commerce. Further research is needed with a view to producing new packages from renewable sources such as cellulose-containing materials, which are widely available in nature, or from recycled cellulose-based materials such as cartonboard. Improving distribution processes with new, more effective tools could additionally help alleviate the environmental impact of packaging. Similarly, new production processes such as additive manufacturing and 3D printing might help optimize package volume and shape, thereby facilitating more sustainable production through, for example, reduced CO2 emissions. Currently available technology can be useful to rethink the whole e-commerce packaging paradigm, which has changed very little over the past few decades.}

To assess the application and perceived usefulness of the Accreditation Council for Graduation Medical Education Milestones system for resident evaluation among urology program directors (PDs).
Materials and Methods
We conducted an online survey of 133 urology PDs. The survey addressed several domains: (1) demographic information, (2) logistics and implementation of the faculty Clinical Competency Committee meetings, and (3) perceived overall effectiveness and usefulness of the Milestones assessments.
Results
Eighty-eight responses were obtained (66% response rate). A total of 42/88 programs (48%) described the Milestones as very or somewhat unhelpful in resident evaluation, with a comparable proportion (44%) responding Milestones assessments never or almost never accurately distinguished between residents. Respondents felt higher scores on all domains of the Milestones were completely or somewhat uncorrelated to higher in-service examination scores (58%), with a smaller fraction (49%) deeming they were not predictive of board passage rates. Overall, 30% of respondents answered neutrally as to whether they felt the Milestones format has led to better resident formative feedback, and 35% were neutral as to the implications of this system toward promoting professional development.
Conclusion
The Accreditation Council for Graduation Medical Education Milestones system for resident evaluation was initiated to create a uniform competency-based assessment system; however, a sizable proportion of urology PDs in our cohort did not find the Milestones system helpful or accurate in assessing residents or predicting future successes. Given the Milestones system is still in its infancy, the utility of this system within urology has yet to be fully assessed.}

An important discussion point before chemotherapy is ovarian toxicity, a side-effect that profoundly affects young women with cancer. Their quality of life after successful treatment, including the ability to conceive, is a major concern. We asked whether serum anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) measurements before chemotherapy for two most common malignancies are predictive of long-term changes in ovarian reserve?
Design
A prospective cohort study measured serum AMH in 66 young women with lymphoma and breast cancer, before and at 1 year and 5 years after chemotherapy, compared with 124 healthy volunteers of the same age range (18–43 years). Contemporaneously, patients reported their menses and live births during 5-year follow-up.
Results
After adjustment for age, serum AMH was 1.4 times higher (95% CI 1.1 to 1.9; P < 0.02) in healthy volunteers than in cancer patients before chemotherapy. A strong correlation was observed between baseline and 5-year AMH in the breast cancer group (P < 0.001, regression coefficient = 0.58, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.89). No significant association was found between presence of menses at 5 years and serum AMH at baseline (likelihood ratio test from logistics regression analysis).
Conclusions
Reproductive-age women with malignancy have lower serum AMH than healthy controls even before starting chemotherapy. Pre-chemotherapy AMH was significantly associated with long-term ovarian function in women with breast cancer. At key time points, AMH measurements could be used as a reproductive health advisory tool for young women with cancer. Our results highlight the unsuitability of return of menstruation as a clinical indicator of ovarian reserve after chemotherapy.}

The storage temperature is one of the most important drivers in controlling the physicochemical properties of a perishable product throughout the distribution chain. Therefore, a fair strategy for ensuring the quality and safety of products to the final consumer is to monitor the temperature conditions experienced by products during their storage time spent in warehouses, through dedicated location-mapping activities. However, the warehousing literature reveals a lack of methods and tools to lead managers through temperature warehouse mapping. In view of this, this chapter proposes a tool tailored for the calculation and visualization of temperature profiles of each storage location over a given time period. The proposed tool is validated through a multiple case study provided by two third-party logistics (3PL) companies that deal with the storage of biomedical products and beverages, respectively. Then, a support-decision model devoted to the storage assignment problem for a perishable item warehouse is formulated. This model, properly fueled by the proposed tool, can be used to handle operational decisions and the put-away process when stored items can be affected by thermal stresses.}

abstract = {Lignocellulosic biomass is a sustainable feedstock for fuel ethanol production, but it is characterized by low mass and energy densities, and distributed production with relatively small scales is more suitable for cellulosic ethanol, which can better balance cost for the feedstock logistics. Lignocellulosic biomass is recalcitrant to degradation, and pretreatment is needed, but more efficient pretreatment technologies should be developed based on an in-depth understanding of its biosynthesis and regulation for engineering plant cell walls with less recalcitrance. Simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation has been developed for cellulosic ethanol production, but the concept has been mistakenly defined, since the saccharification and co-fermentation are by no means simultaneous. Lignin is unreactive, which not only occupies reactor spaces during the enzymatic hydrolysis of the cellulose component and ethanol fermentation thereafter, but also requires extra mixing, making high solid loading difficult for lignocellulosic biomass and ethanol titers substantially compromised, which consequently increases energy consumption for ethanol distillation and stillage discharge, presenting another challenge for cellulosic ethanol production. Pentose sugars released from the hydrolysis of hemicelluloses are not fermentable with Saccharomyces cerevisiae used for ethanol production from sugar- and starch-based feedstocks, and engineering the brewing yeast and other ethanologenic species such as Zymomonas mobilis with pentose metabolism has been performed within the past decades. However strategies for the simultaneous co-fermentation of pentose and hexose sugars that have been pursued overwhelmingly for strain development might be modified for robust ethanol production. Finally, unit integration and system optimization are needed to maximize economic and environmental benefits for cellulosic ethanol production. In this article, we critically reviewed updated progress, and highlighted challenges and strategies for solutions.}

As a low-pollution and low-consumption transportation organization mode, multimodal freight transport has been highly valued. Strengthening the organization and management of multimodal freight transport between seaports and inland areas is conducive to reducing carbon emission levels and logistics costs in the transportation industry. In the multimodal freight transport network, a reasonable hinterland for the main hub port can effectively avoid homogeneous competition, realize the optimal allocation of transport resources, and promote the integrated and coordinated development of the region. In constructing a multimodal freight transport network and arranging a reasonable organization mode, it is beneficial to divide the hinterland of main hub ports and promote energy conservation and emission reduction in the transportation industry. From the perspective of hinterland division and coordination of transportation organization methods, we construct a 0–1 planning model to minimize total cost, transportation time, and carbon emissions. By combining the nondominated ranking method and ideal point method, the algorithm sifts and reorganizes each transportation mode and path in different cities, thereby further overcoming the subjectivity of the weighting method and obtaining the nondominated Pareto optimal frontier solution set. Finally, the evaluation function is used to determine the optimal scheme. Taking the main hub port in the Yangtze River Delta region as an example to verify the validity of the model and algorithm, this research can provide decision support for departments when they formulate policies related to optimizing the regional transportation structure, can promote regional integration and coordinated development of coastal and inland areas, and has practical significance for the “dual carbon” goal.}

abstract = {Background and aims
Upon consumption, carotenoids, which may attenuate cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, diffuse from the blood and accumulate in the skin. This study aimed to assess the associations between dietary, plasma, and skin carotenoids with CVD risk indicators and to examine the mediational role of plasma carotenoids in the relationship between skin carotenoids status (SCS) and CVD risk.
Methods and results
Dietary, plasma, and skin carotenoids were assessed in a cross-sectional study from a community in Singapore (n = 103) aged 50 to 75 y. Multiple linear regression and binary logistics regression models were used to examine the associations between the carotenoids status with classical CVD risk factors and composite CVD risk indicators. After controlling for covariates, SCS and plasma carotenoids were inversely associated with systolic blood pressure (skin: P < 0.001; plasma: P < 0.05) and diastolic blood pressure (skin: P < 0.001; plasma: P < 0.005). Additionally, each increment of 1000 in SCS was associated with an odds ratio of 0.924 (P < 0.01) for metabolic syndrome diagnosis and 0.945 (P < 0.05) for moderate to high CVD risk classification. Associations between SCS and composite CVD risk indicators were null when adjusted for the corresponding plasma carotenoids, indicating complete mediation. Dietary carotenoids, however, showed no relationship with the CVD risk indicators.
Conclusion
Carotenoids bioavailability may be important for cardiovascular protection. SCS, driven by the corresponding plasma carotenoids, could be a potential noninvasive surrogate marker for CVD risk determination in middle-aged and older adults.

abstract = {This paper reports on the evaluation of a prototype sensor system embedded in a low-cost portable instrument for leaf vegetable production. The system involves circular scanning of crop canopies to identify crop biomass yield using distance sensors. The results of these scans are height profiles along an angular position from 0° to 360°, which are the input for the biomass estimation. Two experiments were developed to test the performance of the system’s prototype. The first experiment was conducted in a greenhouse with lettuce and kale. Biomass was estimated from the sensor system’s measurements resulting in the coefficient of determination (R2) for regression between measured and predicted biomass between 0.74 and 0.93, root mean squared error (RMSE) between 0.295 ln(g) and 0.441 ln(g), and percentage error between 25% and 55%. These values include both dry and fresh biomass for lettuce and kale. The second experiment was conducted in a spinach field of a commercial farm in Sherrington, Quebec, Canada. The R2 values were 0.78 and 0.94. The RMSE was, in turn, 4.18 t/ha and 2.16 t/ha. While only fresh biomass was considered for the spinach case, two approaches for processing laser-based height profiles are discussed: regression of profile-representative features and inference of a canopy density function. The results indicate that the developed sensor system would be a suitable tool for rapid assessment of fresh biomass in the field. Its application would be beneficial in the process of optimizing crop management logistics, comparing the performance of different varieties of crops, and detecting potential stresses in a field environment.}

This paper aims at unbundling the effect of culture on the use of social network sites and thus contributes to our understanding on the way cognitive and learning processes influence the engagement with social networks. The study of over 600 social networking users addresses how professional and leisure use of social networks differs across cultures, gender and other demographics. Firstly, by utilising ANOVA techniques we associate users' behaviour with nationality and furthermore through the use of an ordered logistics regression we delineate clusters of users by the purpose of social networking adoption and their cultural characteristics. Our study helps bridge the gap in literature on identifying how cultural traits, nationality and gender affect both business and leisure use of social networking. The implications of differences in user behaviour driven by nationality and gender warrant further need for applying learning analytics in social platforms to enhance user experience. Future directions of research on social networking in relation to cognition and culture are offered for discussion.}

abstract = {As the operation and maintenance (O&M) costs constitute a substantial portion of the overall life-cycle cost of offshore wind farms, routing, and scheduling of maintenance are very important for cost reduction. With the multi-type of vessels, multi-period, multi-base of O&M, multi-wind farm and uncertain weather conditions, the optimization of O&M cost is more challenging. In this article, a hybrid heuristic optimization of maintenance routing and scheduling for offshore wind farms is proposed. First, with the maintenance service protocol, mixed particle swarm optimization (MPSO) is applied to seek a desired mapping relation between vessels and wind farms. Utilizing the formalized rules, an optimal vessel allocation scheme is explored in the large solution space by individual crossover, swarm crossover and mutation. Then, with the scheme of vessel allocation, a discrete wolf pack search (DWPS) is introduced to optimize the maintenance route under all constraints. As the evaluation standard of MPSO, the purpose of DWPS is to search the solution space with depth and breadth balanced and find the optimal and open maintenance route with multiple round trips to bases that minimize O&M costs, including travel, technician and penalty costs. Finally, computational experiments and analysis are carried out. The results provide both the optimized cost and detailed arrangements, which can be directly used in the maintenance schedule.}

The obtained dynamic data by WSN including temperature, humidity, O2, CO2 indicators, and an Arrhenius equation based kinetic model were simulated with field cold chain scenarios to determine the shelf life and quality loss probability. The key quality control points were identified based on the HACCP plan and unified representation and reasoning rule were established for enhancing the HACCP knowledge sharing and reuse. The system was tested and evaluated in cold chain logistics from Rushan to Fuzhou, China. The results show WSN-based monitoring can achieve the dynamic indicators continuous monitoring and contribute to the CCPs dynamic adjustment. The application of WSN-enabled and knowledge-based HACCP modeling as effective approach can help to increase cold chain management (CCM) transparency and improve the quality control for the frozen shellfish during their commercial life.}

This challenging goal requires a significant effort in identifying key enabling technologies in different sectors, such as: propulsion, structures, in-situ resource utilization, logistics, and energy. Considering the latter field, energy supply, the conversion of heat into electricity has considerable heritage for space applications. In fact, such systems have been utilized since the 1950s to be directly employed in space mission scenarios.

The work presented herein aims at reviewing all the Heat to Electricity Conversion systems developed for space applications, as well as analyzing recent developments for ground applications. Conversion systems performances are evaluated and compared considering power output, specific power, hot and cold side temperature, efficiency, technology readiness level, reliability, system complexity, and cost.

Recently, biomass has been received increasing attention due to its economic and environmental benefits. Olefin, as one of the key raw materials in petrochemical industries, is able to be produced from biomass feedstocks. This study presents a robust three-stage stochastic programming model to characterize and optimize an olefin supply chain/production network aiming to provide a reliable and economic logistics network to support olefin production. This model encompasses probabilistic scenarios and uncertainty sets to capture the seasonality of biomass feedstocks and the uncertainty of carbon tax rate, respectively. The Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) is also involved in this model to complement the traditional biomass supplies to ensure the reliable feedstock for olefin production. To find the optimal solution of this model, a hybrid robust/stochastic approach is developed by integrating the affinely adjustable robust model with the sample average approximation (SAA) method. The state of Mississippi is used as a real case study to test and validate the proposed model and optimization approach. The results show that increasing feedstocks conversion rate by 20% and MSW recycling rate by 100% will increase olefin production by 17.26% and 14.3%, respectively, and increasing the carbon tax rate uncertainty from 0 to 30 will decrease the total network emissions by 2.8%. The proposed optimization approach will generate more robust and reliable results. These results indicate that the proposed model and optimization approach would benefit both economic and environmental perspectives in biomass based olefin production.}

The study objectives were to establish and validate a nomogram for pathological invasiveness prediction in clinical stage IA lung adenocarcinoma and to help identify those potentially unsuitable for sublobar resection–based computed tomography texture features.
Method
Patients with clinical stage IA lung adenocarcinoma who underwent surgery at Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital between January 2015 and October 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. All surgically resected nodules were pathologically classified into less-invasive and invasive cohorts. Each nodule was manually segmented, and its computerized texture features were extracted. Clinicopathological and computed tomographic texture features were compared between 2 cohorts. A nomogram for distinguishing the pathological invasiveness was established and validated.
Results
Among 428 enrolled patients, 249 were diagnosed with invasive pathological subtypes. Smoking status (odds ratio, 2.906; 95% confidence interval, 1.285-6.579; P = .011), mean computed tomography attenuation value (odds ratio, 1.005, 95% confidence interval, 1.002-1.007; P < .001), and entropy (odds ratio, 8.536, 95% confidence interval, 3.478-20.951; P < .001) were identified as independent predictors for pathological invasiveness by multivariate logistics regression analysis. The nomogram showed good calibration (P = .182) with an area under the curve of 0.849 when validated with testing set data. Decision curve analysis indicated the potentially clinical usefulness of the model with respect to treat-all or treat-none scenario. Compared with intraoperative frozen-section, the nomogram performed better in pathological invasiveness diagnosis (area under the curve, 0.815 vs 0.670; P = .00095).
Conclusions
We established and validated a nomogram to compute the probability of invasiveness of clinical stage IA lung adenocarcinoma with great calibration, which may contribute to decisions related to resection extent.}

Currently, at the clinical settings, the gold standard diagnostic platforms for multiplexed sensing are multi-step, time consuming, requiring expensive and bulky instruments with a constant need of electricity which makes them unsuitable for resource-limited or POC settings. These technologies are often limited by logistics, costly assays and regular maintenance. Although there have been several attempts to miniaturize these diagnostic platforms, they stand short of batch fabrication and they are dependent on complementary components such as syringe pumps. Here, we demonstrated the development and clinical testing of a disposable, multiplexed sensing device (ToMMx), which is a portable, high-throughput and user-friendly microfluidic platform. It was built with inexpensive plastic materials and operated manually without requiring electrical power and extensive training. We validated this platform in a small cohort of 50 clinical samples from patients with cardiovascular diseases and healthy controls. The platform is rapid and gives quantifiable results with high sensitivity, as low as 5.29 pg/mL, from only a small sample volume (4 μL). ToMMx platform was compared side-by-side with commercial ELISA kits where the total assay time is reduced 15-fold, from 5 h to 20 min. This technology platform is broadly applicable to various diseases with well-known biomarkers in diagnostics and monitoring, especially with potential future impact at the POC settings.}

abstract = {Machine learning-based human activity recognition (HAR) as the means of human–computer interaction is important to empower the existing systems in the industry such as manufacturing and logistics to be more autonomous. However, it is often difficult to build HAR models due to the limitation of annotated samples. Domain adaptation has emerged to address such limitation (or absence) of labeled samples in the domain of interest (i.e., target domain) by using abundant amount of labeled samples in the other domain (i.e., source domain). Domain adaptation aims to solve learning problems where a source domain and a target domain are different but still related. With the use of homogeneous feature space, the existing approaches on homogeneous domain adaption is prohibitive for the real-life scenario, in which two different domains could be possibly of heterogeneous feature space. Although heterogeneous domain adaptation approaches exist, it still requires additional information (i.e., instance correspondence) which is difficult to satisfy when we deal with sensor data. Hybrid domain adaptation, a special case of heterogeneous domain adaptation where common feature between domain exists, is more realistic as the feature commonality is easier to satisfy. However, the existing approach operates using common features in the original feature space, which in fact, may still have distribution difference. In addition, the existing one requires hand-crafted feature extractions for more informative descriptors to classify human activities. In this work, we propose a deep architecture for hybrid domain adaptation, to enable end-to-end learning for human activity classification. The architecture is tested on sensor-based human activity recognition dataset. The experimental result shows that our approach yields better result compared to the existing human activity recognition approaches, both the deep and shallow approaches.}

The environmental and social sustainability-related processes are poorly managed compared to the economic process. The quality of environmental and social sustainability (EnSoS) practices ought to be enhanced by measuring current sustainability practices, and at the same time, obstacles to sustainability have to be identified. Some of the previous work try to develop a sustainability framework, but less attention is paid to develop the EnSoS assessment framework for the freight transport industry. To bridge this research gap, this study develops an EnSoS framework based on an integrated multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method, i.e., fuzzy best-worst method (FBWM) and fuzzy logic approach. The proposed framework evaluates the current sustainability performance with an index and highlights the obstacles to the sustainable freight transportation system. The proposed framework presents two sustainability enablers, nine dimensions, and sixty-three sustainability attributes, including ten new attributes. The FBWM method is used to compute the fuzzy importance weight of attributes, whereas the fuzzy logic is used to assess the performance of each attribute. The proposed framework is validated with the case of the Indian freight industry. The fuzzy transportation EnSoS index (FTEnSoSI) is computed as (3.511, 6.366, 8.418), and close to ‘very environmental and social sustainable (VESS)’ label. The fuzzy performance importance index (FPII) is computed to assess the performance of each attribute. Based on FPII value, thirty attributes are identified as obstacles to transport sustainability. The result analysis presented proposed policy measures for improving EnSoS obstacles.}

Indeed, Logistics and task force costs are important for implementing a new factory in a country. Then, the concurrence is unequal for European and developed countries. Industry of the future appears in this context as a new method based on new technologies deployment (and organization) for improving company performance. Many concepts are being developed in the frame of “factory of the future”. Most of them, insist only on new technology integration everywhere in manufacturing processes or on company supply chains. Thus, industrial problems could be solved very quickly by using machines, robots, cobots, RFID, but also internet of thing (IoT), decision aided tools, etc. Some of them integrate social aspects in their framework. But, none of them are based on sustainability in future changes. The main objective of this new framework is to put this sustainability as the kernel of future company evolutions in the frame of ‘Industry 4.0’. This paper will focus on concepts of this new factory framework for defining changes and steps in the frame of factory of the future. Based on sustainability (social, societal and environmental dimensions), and in addition to new technologies and organization, flexibility in company position would be added as one of main development factors. After presenting concepts and formalisms of this new framework and how they could be used on a company, a detailed illustration example will be shown for validating concepts elaborated. In this paper, artificial intelligence (machine learning, expert systems, multi-agent systems) will also be used for defining the structure of a decision aided tool in order to optimize company dispatching flows.}

While many prior works aimed to find a path between a source and a destination with the smallest traveling distance/time, they do not take into account the quality constraints (e.g., obstacles) of the returned paths, such as uneven roads, roads under construction, and weather conditions on roads. Inspired by this, in this paper, we consider two types of ad-hoc obstacles, keyword-based and weather-based obstacles, on road networks, which can be used for modeling roads that the returned paths should not pass through. In the presence of such ad-hoc obstacles on roads, we formulate a path routing query over road networks with ad-hoc obstacles (PRAO), which retrieves paths from source to destination on road networks that do not pass ad-hoc keyword and weather obstacles and have the smallest traveling time. In order to efficiently answer PRAO queries, we design effective pruning methods and indexing mechanism to facilitate efficient PRAO query answering. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the efficiency and effectiveness of our approaches over real/synthetic data sets.}

The recycling of the plastic waste can help in reducing it and its environmental threat. The purpose of this paper is to identify the factors that influence the consumer’s return/recycling intention regarding plastic waste. Moreover, recycling behavior of consumer was explored in detail. The theory of planned behavior was adapted and extended to measure the determinants of recycling behavior. Survey research design was employed whereas data includes valid 243 households, collected through survey questionnaire, by employing purposive sampling. PLS-SEM was applied on the collected data for hypotheses testing. The finding of this study indicates that subjective norms, awareness consequences and convenience are major predictors of return/recycling intention. Whereas, hypothesis for the attitude, perceived behavioral control and moral norms were rejected and they all have insignificant impact on return/recycling intention. Moreover, return intention have positive significant impact on resell, reuse, dispose and donate. Reuse was the most predicted by the return intention. This study enriches the literature of reverse logistics helping to understand the consumers’ perspective. Provides the insights that will help government and organizations to understand consumers’ return/recycling intention and formulate such strategies that will increase the involvement of consumers in recycling activities.}

This change in consumer behaviour revitalised the practice of home delivery. Consumers prefer their homes in favour of alternative locations, despite the fair chance that they are not present at the time of delivery. The result is delivery failure, which creates unnecessary costs for logistics service providers and retailers, inconveniences for consumers and an additional burden to the environment. Smart lock systems are presented as a promising solution, as they enable access to delivery couriers by means of dedicated digital keys, even when no one is at home to receive the order. Smart locks’ technical feasibility has been demonstrated, yet consumer acceptance is the main obstacle in implementation. To this end, we organised six focus group discussions with 49 e-consumers. Findings suggest that consumers are reluctant to adopt smart lock systems, mainly because of security concerns. Suggested solutions to alleviate the obstacles include improving courier information, limiting courier access and enhancing professional support. The research contributes to the theoretical knowledge pool of efficiency-improving parcel delivery developments and provides insight into consumer acceptance of a delivery innovation that has the potential to reduce costs and increase efficiency, sustainability and receiver satisfaction.}

The few applied ongoing use cases include blockchain for food, healthcare, and logistics supply chains have emphasized blockchain's untapped potential. Potential support for supply chain and sustainability issues include improving efficiency, transparency, and traceability in addition to billions of dollars in corporate financial savings. Given its promise, the adoption of blockchain technology, although hyped for years, has not seen rapid acceptance. In this study, the technology-organization-environment framework and force field theories are utilized to investigate blockchain adoption barriers. Using various literature streams on technology, organizational practices, and sustainability, a comprehensive overview of barriers for adopting blockchain technology to manage sustainable supply chains is provided. The barriers are explored using technology, organizational, and environmental – supply chain and external – framework followed by inputs from academics and industry experts and then analyzed using the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) tool. The results show that supply chain and technological barriers are the most critical barriers among both academics and industry experts. We further determine the similarities and differences among academics and practitioners in perceiving the barriers. This exploratory study reveals interesting relative importance and interrelationships of barriers which are necessary, theoretically and practically for further adoption and dissemination of blockchain technology in a sustainable supply chain environment. It also sets the stage for theoretical observations for understanding blockchain technology implementation in sustainable supply chains. A series of research propositions and research directions culminate from this exploratory study.}

Complementary and integrative medicine (CIM) therapies show clinical benefits with minimal side effects, yet challenges to effective integration in hospital settings remain. The current study aimed to better understand the process of integration of CIM therapies at a large urban pediatric hospital from the perspectives of providers, parents, and administrators.
Design
The study employed an applied medical ethnography.
Setting
The ethnography was conducted before, during, and after an Integrative Medicine Pain Consult Service (IM Pilot) was implemented at a large urban pediatric hospital during the spring of 2017.
Main outcome measures
Fieldwork interviews, participant observations, and document review captured aspects of the integration of CIM over a 6-month study period. Ethnographic analysis included thematic content analysis. Participants included providers (n = 10), administrators (n = 5), and parents of patients (n = 11).
Results
Emergent themes from analysis of the interviews and field notes were organized according to the socio-ecological model. Themes included facilitating factors for CIM pain management at the intrapersonal and community levels (Alignment with Parental Perceptions of Child Needs and Provider Desire to Offer Care, Alignment of CIM with Spiritual Beliefs and Community Norms) and barriers at the interpersonal, organizational, and political levels (Inter-professional Challenges, Lack of Logistics in Place for Referrals and Triaging Patients with Pain, Lack of Remuneration/Insurance Reimbursement for Care).
Conclusions
To address barriers, future efforts to implement integrative pain management programs in pediatric hospital settings may consider testing implementation strategies, including engaging program champions and family advocates, providing education on CIM professions and therapies to hospital staff, and billing for provider time rather than individual CIM therapies.}

abstract = {The present chapter aims to explore various business areas where blockchain technology (BCT) is applicable. The chapter aims to discuss existing real-time applications across the globe by various organizations and also covers various future use cases which are under implementation. The chapter puts emphasis on the benefits this technology provides to various industries, organizations, and society at large, and how this technology can transform the lives. It also aims to explore various concerns and challenges for the implementation of BCT. The chapter also put these business applications into separate categories in order to help the developers and practitioners for their future research, development, and application. Blockchain is the technology behind the birth of bitcoin and cryptocurrency. Just a few years ago, majority of the people in the world used to know that it is the only application of BCT. However, today the world knows the disruption this technology has brought everywhere. This technology is revolutionizing almost every industry. A study conducted by IBM, in which they have surveyed more than three thousand executives worldwide, shows that around 80% of them are actively implementing or planning to implement one or the other aspect of BCT in their day-to-day business. There may be the possibility that the transformation through this technology is not immediately realised, but in the coming course of time, it will prove to be a necessity to adapt to this technology for the business sectors. This technology helps businesses improve efficiency, provides security to data and information, reduces costs by eliminating unnecessary middlemen. Blockchain is a public ledger which maintains records of all the transactions held on a blockchain network while working in distributed manner. This blockchain network is a peer-to-peer network which does not need any central authority to authenticate/settle/control the transactions in the underlying network and thereby removes middlemen and brings transparency and improved security. In the era of digitalization, hacking and data breaching are the common problems all businesses are facing. The development of this technology has changed the way business transactions were done in the past. It has not only given birth to the digital currency but also transforming the businesses and societies. There are plenty of applications and use cases where BCT can be implemented, and businesses can be benefited through distributed ledger technology (DLT). This technology has been implemented in various business areas such as Financial Services Sector, Healthcare, Insurance, Real Estate, Music, Logistics and Supply Chain, and so on. This technology with the help of smart contacts able to provide financial services without intermediary and can manage securities, claims, and settlement in an efficient manner. This technology is redefining healthcare sector by not only improving direct healthcare systems but also healthcare insurance systems. Transformation in insurance sector is also visible through this technology by bringing transparency and security for all the parties involved. Real estate sector reshaping has been started, as this technology is managing property title, ownership records, and other important data and records in a secured and immutable manner. By restructuring the musicians ownership rights and providing fair payments has brought transformation in music industry. This technology is not only redesigning the supply chain management but also logistics industry, trucking, shipping, freights, and all other modes of transports for transporting the goods. Not only all these areas are getting it implemented, but also it has reached to Government and public sector for various services such as better delivery of services, Government to Public payments, elimination of bureaucracy, prevention of frauds, and many more. Due to digitalization, identity management has always been a matter of concern for all public as well as private organizations. The BCT application is providing solutions to all such problems as well.}

abstract = {With the rapid development of modern logistics systems, the unmanned aerial vehicle (a.k.a. drone) based delivery service emerges as a technology-driven innovation, and it is now pilot running in many regions across the globe. The drone delivery system aims to reduce the labor cost in the current labor-intensive courier industry, as well as avoid the disturbance caused by geographic and demographic features. For the drone delivery service providers to survive and prosper, a pool of shared drones is integrated into the ecological chain, where the courier service providers focus on the delivery operations. For such a drone sharing system, revenue management becomes vital in terms of pricing, drone hiring cost, and service-related cost. To better depict the system dynamics, in the present paper, a time-varying and price-sensitive queueing model is formulated, where the customer behaviors are taken into account, such as balking and abandonment. To guarantee a preset service level, the probability of abandonment and expected delay are considered as the control targets, and the pricing for courier service and the maintained fleet size are considered simultaneously. For the low and moderate quality of service(QoS) target, a fluid control model is constructed with a closed-form solution. For the high QoS target, a modified approximation algorithm is designed to numerically tackle the problem. Based on the simulation, it is observed that the proposed approximation methods not only provide a high-quality joint strategy but also help stabilize the system performance. In addition, only mild price change is needed to reach the optimal condition, and a time lag exists between the optimal fleet sizing and the demand variation, which may shed light on the demand-driven fleet sizing under more general settings.}

However, most of the sensory actuators in previous research were complicated because of the separation of sensing and actuating units. Here, a shape-memory soft actuator integrated with reversible electric/moisture actuating and strain sensing was prepared with a compact sandwich structure. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were used to form a middle composite layer, connecting a hygroscopically deformable polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) layer with a high-performance flexible shape memory polymer (FSMP) layer. With the electrothermal AgNP layer, the PVA-AgNPs-FSMP (PAF) composite shows quick recovery (within 10 s) under ultralow voltage (2 V), high strain-sensing sensitivity (1.56 Gauge Factor) and fast response to deformation (110 m s). What is more, the compact construction endows the PAF composite with electrical stability in 1000 bending cycles. Due to the novel combination of PVA, FSMP and AgNPs, the low-power PAF actuator can efficiently load and unload target objects without additional cooling process, and distinguish the presence and weights of them in real time. The results suggest that the soft PAF actuator has great potential applications in soft robotics and biomimetic devices, especially in automated packaging production lines of food, medicine, logistics sorting and other industries.}

abstract = {Background
With the deepening and aggravating of aging in China, depression in the elderly is a common psychological disorder, it can affect the quality of life, and even lead to suicide in severe cases.
Objective:
To understand the prevalence of depression in elderly outpatients in Community health centers (CHCs) and analyze the influencing factors related to depression.
Methods
We conducted a multi-center, cross-sectional, one-to-one questionnaire survey. The depression symptoms were assessed by the Patients Health Questionnaire Depression Scale (PHQ-9). In the questionnaire, we also collected the sociodemographic characteristics, health status, and visiting conditions of the patients. The correlates were analyzed through the chi-square test and stepwise logistics regression.
Results:
619 elderly patients participated in the survey and the prevalence of depression was 26.3%. Patients with low education level (Junior high school OR=0.454, High school or secondary school OR=0.461, College and above OR=0.291), living in urban(OR=2.793), poor family relationship (80–89 score OR=0.182,≥90 score OR=0.201), low social support (Satisfied OR=0.37), poor self-infected healthy condition(70–79 score OR=0.463, 80–89 score OR=0.13,≥90 score OR=0.043), physical pain(pain sometimes OR=2.002, interfere with daily life OR=3.012), high medical expense (≥400 yuan OR=3.47), no long-term use of medicine (OR=0.326) and frequent visits to CHCs (OR=1.857 ) and general hospitals (≥1 time per month OR=2.08) were the risk factors for depression of elderly patients, all P values <0.05.
Conclusion
It is necessary for primary care to incorporate depression into disease management. Through the concerted efforts of family, society and general practitioners, the adjustable risk factors (social demographic and health-related factors) of depression could be controlled to improve the quality of life of patients and the effective use of community health services.}

abstract = {Background
Challenges must be handled in an integrated manner when addressing food security and climate change. More efficient designs for food production systems, as well as their logistics, are needed in order to increase food production and to reduce emissions intensity. Specifically, any enhancements done on this purpose would contribute to mitigating climate change. Five important dimensions are being considered in smart agriculture: food security, availability, accessibility, utilization, and stability.
Scope and approach
Food supply-demand chain can seriously be effected by uncontrolled population growth. Thus, any perspective to solve these uncontrolled conditions can have a positive impact. Especially giving emphasis on reduction of food losses via expoloring various ways of production, or increasing productivity, or ensuring food security are effective ways for solutions. For example, the use of solar drying for agricultural, marine or meat products is very important for preservation, thus minimizing food losses. However, traditional sun drying is a relatively slow process. Also, the product quality worsens due to several factors: microorganism growth, enzymatic reactions, insect infestations. It is known that utilizing solar energy involves several factors that need attention. Thus, a lot of effort is directed toward improving solar energy technology for drying processes.
Key findings and conclusion
This study presents a smart agriculture design for drying using low cost and highly-efficient solar selective absorber. The system is based on an air heating flat plate solar absorber. Levelized cost of heat (LCOH) for the prototype using solar renewable energy is calculated and compared with the fossil fuel energy sources; natural gas, electricity, and liquified petroleum gas (LPG). In addition; a comparison of the costs for air collectors using various selective absorbers; unglazed or glazed, is presented. It is shown that solar energy, in the long run, will be more advantageous compared to fossil fuels.}

Specifically, beyond primary production some FSCs provide an opportunity to design, plan, and optimize new chains based on the valorization of by-products and waste. A concrete example of such opportunities lies in the exploitation and distribution of by-products from the meat industry. Traditionally, different high-value meat cuts are distributed to retailers and consumers, but less attention is paid to by-products resulting from the slaughtering processes that generate waste and cost instead of being valorized as raw materials for other transformation industries. In order to exploit such business and to reduce the amount of waste associated with the meat industry, new paths can be followed according to the circular economy paradigm. Particularly, new storage, distribution, collection, that is, logistics operations and processes, must be designed and optimized. This chapter provides a high-level analytic model to design optimal networks between the primary meat chain and other supply chains using by-products. Some potential valorization chains are identified and tested through a sensitivity analysis, which highlights the impact of the logistic distance between chains in the pursuit of a circular economy model.}

abstract = {Introduction
Kidney transplantation procedures commonly result in a cold ischemia time (CIT) gap when both kidney grafts are implanted in the same center. Owing to logistics, the procedure is usually consecutive, first accomplishing one surgery and then the other. CIT constitutes an independent risk factor for the development of delayed graft function (DGF) in kidney transplants. The effect that CIT exerts on graft and patient survival is still unclear. This study evaluates the relation of CIT and transplant outcomes by comparing paired kidney transplants in terms of survival and graft function.
Methods
We accomplished a retrospective analysis of 402 kidney transplants performed in our center between 2000 and 2017. We selected all transplants where both organs from the same donor were implanted at our hospital, establishing 2 study groups (group 1: first graft implanted and group 2: second graft implanted) to compare by paired data statistical methods.
Results
We found an increase in the incidence of DGF in group 2 (42% vs 28.8%; P < .05). Group 2 had significantly worse graft function on day 5 posttransplant (4.7 ± 2.88 vs 3.86 ± 2.8 mg/dL of serum creatinine; P < .05). No significant differences in graft function were found on days 30 and 90 posttransplant. We didn't find any difference in graft survival between both groups. Length of hospitalization stay (17.6 days [± 13] vs 21.6 days [± 17]) and hemodialysis sessions (mean of 2.8 [± 2] vs 3.6 [± 2.2]) were higher in group 2.
Conclusion
CIT acts as an independent risk factor for the development of DGF in kidney transplantation. CIT had no isolated effect on graft survival.}

All scientific approaches have in common that flexible intralogistics production networks require an autonomous and intelligent transportation systems that is not designed for a specific task, but can take on different transport roles due to their versatility. However, a comprehensive analysis of current designs and research projects in the field of AGVs and intralogistics transport robots show that there is neither the necessary interoperability of different systems nor a system architecture that addresses a flexible material flow independent of the physical design of the transportation system. AGVs mainly have a central control system, which manages the generation of transport orders and their disposition on the vehicles. In addition, the routes are specified centrally for the vehicles, even if they have free navigation. The individual transport unit is therefore only an executing machine that processes the assigned transport orders without any influence on order dispatching or route planning. Therefore, these AGV approaches do not have the flexibility and autonomy required for an intralogistics production network. The research project addresses the necessary interoperability of logistics systems and the abandonment of proprietary standalone solutions. For this purpose, methods for digitizing the workspace, route planning and path execution using a service-oriented architecture (SOA) were developed. A central component of this architecture is the approach described in the paper to enable decentralized path planning on the vehicles. Therefore, the path planning must be applicable to different target platforms without implementation effort and the vehicle software must be designed independently of the application. This approach allows intralogistics systems to be flexible and adaptable, resulting in a more sustained use of these systems.}

Tumor necrosis factor receptor-related factor 3 (TRAF3) interacting protein 3 (TRAF3IP3) is involved in the development of immune tissues and the immune response of the body. Downregulated expression of TRAF3IP3 in malignant melanoma can inhibit tumor growth. The role of TRAF3IP3 in glioma is unknown.
Methods
We used the Wilcoxon rank sum test to compare the expression of TRAF3IP3 in glioma and normal tissues based on The Cancer Genome Atlas and Genotype Tissue Expression. Logistics regression was used to evaluate the relationship between TRAF3IP3 and clinicopathologic characters. Gene set enrichment analysis and single-sample gene set enrichment analysis were conducted to annotate biological function of TRAF3IP3. We used Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression to evaluate the prognostic value of TRAF3IP3.
Results
We downloaded RNA-seq data of 670 gliomas and 1157 normal tissues. TRAF3IP3 was highly expressed in gliomas (P < 0.001). High expression of TRAF3IP3 and higher World Health Organization grade (odds ratio [OR], 3.57 [2.42–5.34 CI]; P < 0.001), wild-type isocitrate dehydrogenase status (OR, 4.79 [3.40–6.83 CI]; P < 0.001), 1p/19q non-codeletion (OR, 15.32 [9.23–27.01 CI]; P < 0.001), mutant epidermal growth factor receptor status (OR, 2.77 [1.65–4.81 CI]; P < 0.001), worse histologic type (OR, 3.64 [2.48–5.43 CI]; P < 0.001) and worse primary therapy outcome (OR, 2.29 [1.47–3.61 CI]; P < 0.001) were significantly correlated. Six signaling pathways were significantly enriched in the TRAF3IP3 high-expression phenotype group, including JAK-STAT, interferon-γ, apoptosis, P53, programmed cell death protein 1, and CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4). High expression of TRAF3IP3 was associated with worse progression-free survival (hazard ratio [HR], 2.39 (1.39–3.01); P < 0.001), disease-free survival (HR, 3.02 (2.27–4.01); P < 0.001) and overall survival (HR, 2.87 (2.20–3.75); P < 0.001).
Conclusions
TRAF3IP3 play an important role in the occurrence and development of glioma and may be a potential biomarker for the prognosis of glioma.}

abstract = {Offshore wind energy is a renewable source with strong prospects of development, allowing both the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the promotion of technological progress. Nowadays, the top technological solution used in offshore wind foundations is the monopile, with a market share of more than 80%, due to its low-cost when compared to other technologies. Still, its use is limited to shallow waters (depths up to 30 m). Therefore, and for higher depths, other types of foundations should be considered. The authors of this work present a foundation concept for transitional waters with self-floating capability and suction pile embedment. This foundation is formed by a tripod, a transition piece and a variable number of floaters and the respective suction pile. The structure is self-floating and is transported to the installation site aided by tugboats. Under these circumstances, buoyancy and stability of the entire structure must be ensured. The suction piles can also be filled with air during port logistics, through reduction of the necessary port draft. When the structure arrives at the installation site, it submerges by filling the floaters, and the suction piles guarantee the correct attachment to the seabed. Regarding the developed structure, a modal analysis was made to compute its natural frequencies and mode shapes. Moreover, the structure behavior during transportation is evaluated using AQWA tools. The developed foundation was then validated for a certain number of cases defined by the current DNV-GL standard.}

Antenatal hospitalization for pregnancy complications can result in significant stress for pregnant women and their families. Prenatal yoga has been investigated in the outpatient setting as a method to alleviate stress. This study was designed to investigate the feasibility of incorporating prenatal yoga into the inpatient environment for women hospitalized with pregnancy complications.
Study design
High-risk women were recruited from the inpatient antepartum service at Tufts Medical Center (Boston, MA; March 2016 to February 2017) to evaluate the feasibility of an inpatient prenatal yoga program. The thirty-minute session was led by a certified instructor in a room adjacent to Labor and Delivery. Participants and antepartum nurses completed study questionnaires addressing logistics such as class duration and frequency. Perceived benefits of yoga were also explored.
Results
Thirty-nine women were found eligible for this study and were consented for participation. Of these, fifteen (38%) participated in at least one yoga session. Responses to the to the post-class questionnaire by study participants indicated that the thirty minutes allocated for the yoga class was appropriate. Of the eight participants who responded to the discharge questionnaire, all indicated that the class was helpful with regards to stress reduction. Completed questionnaires by the antepartum nursing staff (n = 14) unanimously indicated that the yoga session was helpful for the patients and was not disruptive to medical care.
Conclusion(s)
Prenatal yoga is a technique that has been currently limited to the outpatient setting. This study provides a foundation for continued investigation of inpatient prenatal yoga for women hospitalized with pregnancy complications.}

The objectives of this study are to identify the hot research topics, explore knowledge gaps and recommend future directions in the domain of sustainable transport through a holistic review of the literature published in 2000–2019. A total of 882 bibliometric records of journal articles were searched from the Web of Science core collection database. Both quantitative scientometric analysis and qualitative discussion were undertaken to analyse the sustainable transport research. The analysis results showed nine hot research topics: 1) sustainable transport indicators and performance model, 2) sustainable transport policy, 3) involvement of stakeholders, 4) supply chain and logistics management, 5) environmental impact, 6) travel behaviour, 7) new fuels for vehicles, 8) transport strategic planning, and 9) bicycle and public transport. In addition, four knowledge gaps were identified relating to social sustainability of transport, use of information and communication technology, sustainability benefits, and resilient transport to deliver sustainability. Furthermore, future research directions were proposed to bridge these knowledge gaps. This review focuses on the journal articles in English only and may overlook some significant research published in other languages and conferences. Nevertheless, this study still benefits academics, industry practitioners and policy makers by providing an understanding of status quo, hot research topics, knowledge gaps and future research directions in the domain of sustainable transport.}

abstract = {Faced with an aging workforce, many manufacturing companies consider alleviating the ergonomic strain of material handling on their workers increasingly important. This is one of the reasons why frequent small-lot deliveries of parts to the assembly stations on the shop floor via small electric delivery vehicles – so-called tow trains – have become widespread in many industries. Deploying tow trains, however, does not automatically ease the ergonomic burden on logistics workers, but requires careful stowage planning in addition. In this paper, we consider the following problem. Given a set of bins of differing weight to be carried by tow train to a given set of stations on the shop floor, where should each bin be stowed on the tow train such that it can be unloaded efficiently from an economic perspective while also minimizing the ergonomic strain during loading and unloading? We investigate the physiological stress of handling bins on different levels of a tow train wagon by applying an established ergonomic evaluation method from the human factors engineering literature. We model the ensuing optimization problem as a special type of assignment problem and propose suitable exact and heuristic solution methods. In a computational study, our approaches are shown to perform well, delivering optimal solutions for instances of realistic size within fractions of a second in many cases. We show that optimal stowage plans can significantly ease the physiological burden on the workforce without compromising economic efficiency. We also derive some insights into the ideal layout of the tow train from an ergonomics perspective.}

The aim of this study was to investigate the barriers and facilitators for the adherence of participants to a nutritional intervention.
Methods
A randomized controlled trial was carried out with participants from the Health Academy Program in Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil. The intervention (7 mo) was based on the Transtheoretical Model and on Paulo Freire's pedagogy and offered 12 education activities with the purpose of promoting the consumption of fruits and vegetables. Adherene was determined by calculating the participation percentage (attendance at activities/number of activities).
Results
In all, 1483 individuals participated and the average adherence was 58.3%. Low adherence was demonstrated by 24.3%, medium adherence by 26.5%, and high adherence by 49.2% of the participants. Adherence was associated with aging (odds ratio [OR], 1.97; 95% CI, 1.33–2.94), being unemployed (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.58–0.95), not being under psychiatric treatment (OR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.63–0.95), participant body satisfaction (OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.02–1.58) and participant attendance at the Health Academy Program for >1 y (OR, 2.78; 95% CI, 2.17–3.56). The qualitative analysis revealed the following facilitators for adherence: service structure, intervention methodology, bond-building among users and professionals, family support, and patient-associated aspects. The barriers to adherence included work, self-care, and care for another.
Conclusion
Adherence to the intervention was high, and the patient-associated aspects, the logistics of the Health Academy Program, and the methodology appeared to contribute to adherence. However, the timetable was a barrier for those who were working and for those who support their families.}

However, several challenges including excessively long waiting time and a serious waste of energy still exist on the shop-floor where limited buffer exists for each machine (e.g., shop-floor that manufactures large-size products). The production logistics tasks are released after work-in-processes (WIPs) are processed, and the machines will be occupied before trolleys arrival when using passive material handling strategy. To address this issue, a proactive material handling method for CPS enabled shop-floor (CPS-PMH) is proposed. Firstly, the manufacturing resources (machines and trolleys) are made smart by applying CPS technologies so that they are able to sense, act, interact and behave within a smart environment. Secondly, a shop-floor digital twin model is created, aiming to reflect their status just like real-life objects, and key production performance indicators can be analysed timely. Then, a time-weighted multiple linear regression method (TWMLR) is proposed to forecast the remaining processing time of WIPs. A proactive material handling model is designed to allocate smart trolleys optimally. Finally, a case study from Southern China is used to validate the proposed method and results show that the proposed CPS-PMH can largely reduce the total non-value-added energy consumption of manufacturing resources and optimize the routes of smart trolleys.}

In this paper, we introduce an end-to-end deep learning framework to realize the training free motor imagery (MI) BCI systems. Specifically, we employ the common space pattern (CSP) extracted from electroencephalography (EEG) as the handcrafted feature. Instead of log-energy, we use the multi-channel series in CSP space to retain the temporal information. Then we propose a separated channel convolutional network, here termed SCCN, to encode the multi-channel data. Finally, the encoded features are concatenated and fed into a recognition network to perform the final MI task recognition. We compared the results of the deep model with classical machine learning algorithms, such as k-nearest neighbors (KNN), logistics regression (LR), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and support vector machine (SVM). Moreover, the quantitative analysis was evaluated on our dataset and the BCI competition IV-2b dataset. The results have shown that our proposed model can improve the accuracy of EEG based MI classification (2–13% improvement for our dataset and 2–15% improvement for BCI competition IV-2b dataset) in comparison with traditional methods under the training free condition.}

In this study, we utilised static-renewal and flow-through ecotoxicology tests in parallel on sediments with a wide range of properties and varying types and concentrations of contaminants. The prediction of chronic effects to amphipod reproduction was explored using multiple linear regression (MLR). The study confirmed the considerable over-estimation of the risk of toxicity of contaminated sediments in field locations when assessments rely on the results of laboratory-based static and static-renewal tests. Improved prediction of toxicity risks was achieved using a combination of contaminant exposure measures from sediment and overlying water. Existing sediment and water quality guideline values (GVs) were effective for predicting risks posed by sediments containing mixtures of common metal and organic contaminants. For 17 sediments with paired data sets from static-renewal and flow-through tests, the best prediction of toxicity to reproduction was achieved using a 2-parameter MLR that included hazard quotients for sediment contaminants and toxic units for dissolved metals (r2 = 0.892). The inclusion of particle size, organic carbon and acid-volatile sulfide did not improve toxicity predictions, despite these parameters being recognised as modifying contaminant bioavailability. The use of dilute-acid-extractable metal concentrations in place total recoverable metal concentrations did not improve the predictions. The study also confirmed that sediments existing within the estuarine and marine bays of Sydney Harbour pose significant risks of adverse effects to benthic organisms.}

abstract = {Introduction
The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak impacts the mental health of patients, health workers, and the public. The level of impact on the mental health of orthodontic patients in treatment is unknown. The objective of the study was to evaluate the mental health of orthodontic patients in China during the early stage of the pandemic.
Methods
An online survey was conducted on a convenience sample of anonymous participants. The questionnaire, in Chinese (Mandarin), comprised 5 sections. Sections 1-3 included demographic, epidemical, and orthodontic status of the patients. Section 4 assessed mental health-related to orthodontics. Section 5 was the Kessler-10 Mental Distress Scale. A total of 48 orthodontists were invited to distribute the questionnaires to their patients. Descriptive statistics, principal component analysis, K-means cluster analysis, and bivariate logistics regression analysis were performed with significance set at P <0.05.
Results
Questionnaires were collected from 558 patients (104 males, 354 females; mean age 24.78 ± 6.33 years). The prevalence of mental distress was 38% (174/458). Higher odds ratios were associated with female participants, missed appointments, and Hubei residence. The type of orthodontic appliance was associated with the anxiety of prolonged treatment duration. The manner of communication with patients regarding the postponement of appointments was associated with patients' concerns of prolonged treatment duration. The frequency of contact from dentists was associated with patients' independence.
Conclusions
Over one-third of orthodontic patients experienced mental distress during the pandemic. Multiple factors affected the level of anxiety of orthodontic patients, such as the type of orthodontic appliance, time since last dental visit, manner of communication with the orthodontist, and the localities of the pandemic progression.}

We aimed to identify the barriers and enablers that Health Care Workers (HCWs) in Papua New Guinea experienced in swabbing for COVID-19.
Methods
We conducted a cross-sectional multi-methods study: a qualitative scoping exercise and a telephone survey. The target population was COVID-19-trained HCWs from all provinces of Papua New Guinea. A descriptive analysis of survey responses was conducted alongside a rapid qualitative analysis of interviews and open-ended survey questions.
Results
Four thematic areas were identified: human resources, logistics, HCW attitudes and community attitudes. The survey response rate was 70.3% (407/579). Commonly reported barriers to COVID-19 swabbing were insufficient staff trained (74.0%, n = 301), inadequate staffing in general (64.9%, n = 264), insufficient supply of personal protective equipment (60.9%, n = 248) and no cold chain to store swabs (57.5%, n = 234). Commonly reported enablers to swabbing were community awareness and risk communication (80.8%, n = 329), consistent and sufficient supplies of personal protective equipment (67.8%, n = 276), increased surge workforce (63.9%, n = 260) and having a fridge to store swabs (59.7%, n = 243).
Conclusions
A comprehensive community and HCW engagement strategy combined with innovations to improve the supply chain are needed to increase COVID-19 swabbing in Papua New Guinea to reach national testing targets. Investments in increasing numbers of frontline workforce, consistent supplies of PPE, swabs, transport medium, cold boxes and ability to make ice packs, in addtion to establishing regular tranport of specimens from the facility to the testing site will strengthen the supply chain. Innovations are needed to address these issues.}

Etiology of and outcomes following idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury (DILI) vary geographically. We conducted a prospective study of DILI in India, from 2013 to 2018 and summarize the causes, clinical features, outcomes and predictors of mortality.
Methods
We enrolled patients with DILI using international DILI expert working group criteria and Roussel Uclaf causality assessment method. Follow-up was up to 3 months from onset of DILI or until death. Multivariate logistics regression was carried out to determine predictors of non-survival.
Results
Among 1288 patients with idiosyncratic DILI, 51.4% were male, 68% developed jaundice, 68% required hospitalization and 8.2% had co-existing HIV infection. Concomitant features of skin reaction, ascites, and encephalopathy (HE) were seen in 19.5%, 16.4%, and 10% respectively. 32.4% had severe disease. Mean MELD score at presentation was 18.8 ± 8.8. Overall mortality was 12.3%; 65% in those with HE, 17.6% in patients who fulfilled Hy's law, and 16.6% in those that developed jaundice. Combination anti-TB drugs (ATD) 46.4%, complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) 13.9%, anti-epileptic drugs (AED) 8.1%, non-ATD antimicrobials 6.5%, anti-metabolites 3.8%, anti-retroviral drugs (ART)3.5%, NSAID2.6%, hormones 2.5%, and statins 1.4% were the top 9 causes. Univariate analysis identified, ascites, HE, serum albumin, bilirubin, creatinine, INR, MELD score (p < 0.001), transaminases (p < 0.04), and anti-TB drugs (p = 0.02) as predictors of non-survival. Only serum creatinine (p = 0.017), INR (p < 0.001), HE (p < 0.001), and ascites (p = 0.008), were significantly associated with mortality on multivariate analysis. ROC yielded a C-statistic of 0.811 for MELD and 0.892 for combination of serum creatinine, INR, ascites and HE. More than 50 different agents were associated with DILI. Mortality varied by drug class: 15% with ATD, 13.6% with CAM, 15.5% with AED, 5.8% with antibiotics.
Conclusion
In India, ATD, CAM, AED, anti-metabolites and ART account for the majority of cases of DILI. The 3-month mortality was approximately 12%. Hy's law, presence of jaundice or MELD were predictors of mortality.}

However, how and why protocols are adhered to by frontline health workers in low- and middle-income countries is not always clear. This study explored midwives’ adherence to national postnatal care protocols in two public hospitals in Southern Ghana using an ethnographic study design. Ninety participant observations and 88 conversations were conducted over a 20-months period, and two group interviews held with the midwives in the two hospitals. Data was analysed using a grounded theory approach. Findings: Midwives collectively decided when to adhere, modify or totally ignore postnatal care protocols. Adherence often occurred if required resources (equipment, tools, supplies) were available. Modification occurred when midwives felt that strict adherence could have negative implications for patients and they could be seen as acting ‘unprofessionally’. Ignoring or modifying protocols also occurred when midwives were uncertain of the patient's health condition; basic supplies, logistics and infrastructure needed for adherence were unavailable or inappropriate; or midwives felt they might expose themselves or their clients to physical, psychological, emotional, financial or social harm. Regardless of the reasons that midwives felt justified to ignore or modify postnatal care protocols, it appeared in many instances to lead to the provision of care of suboptimal quality. Conclusion and recommendations: Providing clinical decision-making protocols is not enough to improve mother and new born care quality and outcomes. Faced with constraining conditions of work, providers are likely to modify guidelines as part of coping behaviour. Addressing constraining conditions of work must accompany guidelines. This includes adequate risks protection for health workers and clients; and resolution of deficits in essential equipment, infrastructure, supplies and staffing.}

abstract = {A series of norm-defying hydrocolloid emulsifiers is reported for the challenging task of outstanding long-term retention of volatile cryogenic phase change materials (cryoPCM) in high-payload capsules. Their identification lifted previously imposed restrictions on emulsifier selection in order to fine-tune the mechanical and barrier properties, shell thickness, size and surface roughness of capsules. The exceptionally large payload in terms of both volume (~97 vol%) and weight (~95 wt%), superb long-term retention capability tested at ambient conditions up to 30 days, as well as the surprising cryo-temperature survival of synthesized capsules promote them as immensely efficient candidate carriers for cryogenic thermal energy storage and transport. Utilization of appropriate hydrocolloids and concentrations not only bestows the thermosetting polymeric shells with flexibility, but also eliminates the majority of imbedding satellite particles producing exterior surfaces comparable to a two-step synthesis route ever reported. Promising fatigue resistance within an extreme dynamic temperature range between 20 °C and −140 °C during preliminary cycling tests has been demonstrated via direct observation of capsule buckling and restoration. Such findings provide fundamental insights into achieving superior capsule quality and their far-reaching impacts beyond cryogenic energy storage on applications such as less harsh cold chain logistics, electrophoresis displays, battery safety management and self-healing materials.}

La crise COVID-19 s’est abattue sur le Haut-Rhin en quelques jours. Les premiers signaux ont été constatés au niveau du centre de réception et de régulation des appels (CRRA) provoquant une suractivité encore jamais égalée. Dix jours plus tard, ce sont les patients présentant des tableaux de détresse respiratoire qui ont provoqué un second pan d’activité inhabituel tant dans la recherche de lits de réanimation que dans la gestion de logistique de transferts. L’intensité de la crise a nécessité une grande capacité d’adaptation : renfort de ressources humaines, renforcement de l’infrastructure technique, formation, innovations organisationnelles, centralisation des informations et de l’organisation logistique des transferts. L’aspect inédit de cette épidémie a également mis en exergues des fragilités notamment dans les actions de coordination régionale. Les solutions mises en œuvre doivent être partagées et permettre d’anticiper la survenue d’une éventuelle nouvelle épidémie.
Summary
The COVID-19 crisis hit the Haut-Rhin in a few days. The first signals were noticed at the level of emergency call center causing an overactivity that has never been experienced so far. Ten days later, the patients with signs of respiratory distress triggered an unusual second round activity in booth the search for reanimation beds and in the management of transfer logistics. The intensity of the crisis required a great capacity for adaptation: reinforcement of human resources, strengthening of technical infrastructure, trainings, organizational innovations, centralization of information and of the logistical organization of transfers. The unprecedented aspect of this epidemic also highlighted weaknesses, particularly in regional coordination actions. The solutions implemented must be shared and must help to anticipate the occurrence of a possible new epidemic.}

This qualitative focus group study sought to describe how colleges of pharmacy use simulation-based learning (SBL) to teach cardiovascular topics and to identify challenges and benefits.
Material and methods
Participants were recruited from a screening survey disseminated via e-mail to select American College of Clinical Pharmacy Practice and Research networks. Subjects were selected based on diversity in institution and simulation types. Two 1-hour focus group sessions were conducted by the primary investigator following a script designed by the research team. Each recorded session was independently reviewed by all investigators and coded into final themes. Results are reported in a qualitative fashion.
Results
Five individuals provided consent and participated. Themes identified include topics, formats, interprofessional education, challenges, strategies for success, and benefits. Frequent topics included advanced cardiac life support, heart failure, hypertension, and transitions of care. Multiple formats were used including standardized patients or providers, task trainers, and high-fidelity mannequins. Multiple institutions reported simulating interprofessional teams by involving students from other health professions. Scheduling, pharmacy program size, faculty availability, and logistics around planning and/or conducting an event were identified challenges. Institutions reported success when clear expectations were provided to students and skill development progressed from low-stakes to high-stakes events. Benefits reported included real world applicability with participants noting that students do not realize the importance of SBL until they have reached rotations.
Conclusions
Various topics and simulation methods were employed to teach cardiovascular topics. While challenges exist, institutions have identified strategies for success and report students recognized the benefits to their learning.}

The radio frequency identification (RFID) system is implemented in the supply chain to decrease product losses and the overall lead time of transportation while computing the profit derived from internet and conventional sales. The resulting traceable CLSC improves upon the existing literature by allowing us to: (1) boost the incorporation of traceability assumptions in mathematical programming problems so as to enhance the efficiency and visibility of a supply chain, (2) analyze the strategic effects that different internet sale formats have on customers’ evaluations and acquisition choices, and (3) account for the environmental and socio-economical dimension by explicitly formalizing employment-based incomes as part of the profit function. Two meta-heuristic algorithms are introduced to solve the proposed optimization problem, namely, the greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). Twelve test problems of different sizes are generated and solved using these algorithms. The computational results show that GRASP outperforms PSO in terms of both profit and CPU time values. Finally, a case study in the network marketing industry is presented and managerial implications outlined to show the validity of the proposed model and shed more light on its practical implications.}

abstract = {Background
Dislocations following primary reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (rTSA) are a feared and concerning complication. With the increasing number of reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (rTSA) procedures being performed worldwide e, studies evaluating risk factors for dislocation following this procedure are limited. The purpose of this study was to utilize a large claims database to identify patient-related risk factors associated with dislocations following primary rTSA.
Methods
A retrospective query of the Part A and Part B 100% Medicare Standard Analytical Files (SAF) claims database was performed identifying patients who underwent primary rTSA for the treatment of glenohumeral osteoarthritis. The inclusion criteria for the study group consisted of all patients who had a dislocation within 2-years following the index procedure. Patients with a record of other arthroplasty-type procedures were excluded. The query yielded 30,670 patients with (n = 703) and without (n = 29,967) dislocations. Multivariate binomial logistics regression analysis was performed to calculate odds (OR) on the impact of patient-related risk factors for dislocations following primary rTSA. A P value less than .002 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Study group patients that sustained a dislocation following primary rTSA were generally younger than the age of 65 (16.8 vs. 8.3%) and male (59.6 vs. 38.8%). Study group patients had a higher comorbidity burden, as demonstrated by higher mean Elixhauser-Comorbidity Index (ECI) scores (9 vs. 6, P < .0001). The greatest risk factors for dislocations included being male (OR: 3.06, P < .0001), opioid use disorder (OR: 1.74, P = .0007), hypertension (OR: 1.56, P = .001), morbid obesity (OR: 1.43, P < .0001), electrolyte and fluid derangements (OR: 1.29, P = .0001), and depressive disorders (OR: 1.23, P = .0001).
Conclusion
As the number of primary rTSA procedures increase worldwide, identification of patient-related risk factors for dislocations is of great importance. The study showed the greatest risk factors for dislocations included male sex with modifiable risk factors being opioid use disorder, hypertension, and morbid obesity. The study is vital as it can facilitate in guiding orthopedists and altering management for these high-risk patients.

abstract = {Wind power generation has seen a dramatic increase in the 21st century and the Department of Energy (DOE) envisions that wind energy will become a much larger part of overall power generation in the U.S. by 2050. Wind turbines have continued to grow in size during the last few decades with towers commonly built at a height of 80 m for typical utility-scale turbines in the Unites States, and this is accompanied by certain transportation and logistics challenges. The newly proposed tall tower technology has been designed to be cost-effective in assembling towers as high as 140 m from precast concrete module components that are capable of transport on the U.S. road system. This paper presents an alternative wind tower design with potential for reducing the overall levelized cost of energy (LCOE); it evaluates a hexagonal precast concrete wind tower solution that facilitates use of a taller wind turbine generator for harvesting stronger, steadier, and more frequent wind resources to increase wind energy production and lower the overall LCOE. An integrated team of industry experts was consulted to support development of a stochastic life cycle cost model using a parametric estimate of the cost and fabrication and assembly schedules of this new wind tower design concept as well as forecasting the projected revenue to be created by the new technology. The study concludes that this new design concept is a commercially viable solution, with an estimated LCOE savings ranging from 2% to 4% compared with the typical 80 m turbine deployed in the United States, and it also provides wind power potential to previously untapped regions in the country. This paper helps to inform energy developers, manufacturers, and policy makers, both regionally and nationally, of a possible economically feasible wind tower design solution.}

While acting as the key nodes of globalisation and international business, seaports are exposed to the vulnerability of climate impacts, mainly because of their locations, including low-lying areas, coastal zones, and deltas. The paper is to develop a Climate Change Risk Indicator (CCRI) framework for climate risk assessment of seaports, enabling research-informed policymaking on such a demanding topic. Due to the increasing number of extreme weather events (EWEs), climate change adaptation is becoming an essential and necessary issue to be addressed by seaport stakeholders. Climate risk analysis aids rational adaptation planning. Many climate assessments have been done for measuring climate vulnerabilities, and various climate adaptation measures have been proposed for reducing climate risks. However, few of them used quantitative approaches for climate risk evaluations in seaports and fewer on the provisions of CCRIs for comparing climate risks of different locations and timeframes to guide rational policy making. Furthermore, climate change is a dynamic issue, requiring big objective data to support the analysis (e.g. monthly climate data on CCRIs) of climate threats and vulnerabilities. In this paper, Evidence Reasoning (ER) is employed to evaluate the climate risks in seaports by tackling the incomplete data. The findings reveal the quantitative measures of climate change risks in different locations and in different months. Furthermore, the risk levels of seaports in the future are assessed for observing the changes and informing policy making. The main contributions of this study include the visualisation of the comprehensive climate risk levels and provision of a new climate risk analysis framework through the comparison of climate change risks with respect to different locations and timeframes. Suitable climate adaptation measures can be chosen to implement, and seaports can cooperate on climate resilience issues (e.g. seaport network service and pre-disaster relief logistics).}

We examined 10 years of juvenile reef fish catch data from two gear-specific, fishery-independent surveys in the eastern Gulf of Mexico to assess our ability 1) to characterize population trends for various reef species sampled using haul seines or otter trawls and 2) to amend our survey, as logistics would allow, to improve those characterizations. Species richness, catch-per-unit-effort, and length-frequency distributions were generally similar between gear types, suggesting a single survey (i.e., one gear type) may be sufficient. Simulation-based power analyses for the reef fish species indicated that overall, otter trawl data provided greater power for detecting trends over a 10-year period (41–75 % probability to detect a 50 % change in abundance) than haul seine data (27–52 %). Likewise, otter trawl data provided greater power for detecting trends from one year to the next (22–53 % probability to detect a 50 % change in abundance in one year) than haul seine data (15–33 %). Simplifying data collection from two surveys to a single, trawl-only survey (and approximately doubling the number of trawl tows) was more efficient, more effective, and more powerful (64–91 % for the amended design with more tows) in detecting abundance trends. Furthermore, by increasing sample size but retaining all other design elements, the data collected during the trawl survey before and after the change remain comparable; the time series was not interrupted. These changes increase our confidence in estimating population trends, predicting productivity, and informing management and conservation decisions.}

The objective is to test the efficiency and suitability of eco-renovation strategies that have been co-created with local stakeholders and are based on traditional energy conservation measures, as a way to work with locally-based business models that can safeguard cultural aspects and enable economic development. Two living labs have been established in the cities of Vitoria-Gasteiz (Spain) and Cahors (France) in two representative buildings of the historic urban area of each city. The living labs operate as inclusive multi-agent discussion arenas with a long-term vision, where multi-criteria co-creation processes are implemented to select conservation-friendly solutions based on local materials including criteria such as operational energy, impact on heritage values, quality of life, socio-economic development and easy logistics. The energy behaviour of the buildings and the hygrothermal performance of the external walls have been studied using on-site and laboratory experiments, through an efficient partnership between local authorities and universities. Likewise, local-based refurbishment solutions that were designed in the co-creation processes have been thermally characterised in the laboratory, through thermal conductivity and guarded hot box tests. Finally, the energy improvement of the whole renovation strategy has been simulated showing the enhancement of the two buildings.}

abstract = {Background and aims
Carbonyl stress is one of the mechanisms responsible for diabetes and its complications. The study was planned to examine the relationship between carbonyl stress markers and the risk of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
Methods
Forty T2DM patients with ACS and forty T2DM patients without ACS participated in this cross-sectional pilot study. Routine biochemical investigations, creatine kinase-total (CK-T), and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) levels were estimated. Serum carbonyl stress markers were analysed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Binary logistics regression was done to determine the predictive value of carbonyl stress markers for ACS.
Results
Fasting plasma glucose, serum total methylglyoxal (MG), methylglyoxal derived hydroimidazolones-1 (MG-H1), and Nε-carboxymethyl-lysine (CML) levels were significantly higher in T2DM patients with ACS than in those without ACS. Serum glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and glyoxalase-1 (GLO1) levels were significantly lower in T2DM patients with ACS than in those without ACS. Fasting plasma glucose level was significantly positively correlated with serum MG (r = 0.441, P < 0.001), CML (r = 0.649, P < 0.001), MG-H1 (r = 0.725, P < 0.001), and negatively correlated with serum GAPDH (r = – 0.268, P = 0.012) and GLO1 (r = – 0.634, P = 0.016). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that serum GAPDH and GLO1 could predict the risk of ACS in T2DM patients.
Conclusion
These findings revealed that high carbonyl stress due to lower levels of GAPDH and GLO1 may predispose patients with T2DM for more risk of ACS.}

Recent developments in information and communications technology (ICT) enable real-time sharing of individual geographical information, allow for easier participation in the “sharing economy”, and present opportunities for implementing ride sharing at a large-scale. This research aims to quantify the environmental benefits of ride sharing using shared taxis in Beijing as a case study. Trip information extracted from vehicle trajectory data of 12,083 taxis in Beijing are used to evaluate the benefits of ride sharing. Our results show that: 1) only limited opportunity cost to the rider (i.e. tolerance of early departure or delayed arrival) can enable large-scale ride sharing; 2) at a tolerance level of 10 min, ride sharing can reduce fleet vehicle-miles-traveled (VMT) by 33%; and 3) if implemented for the entire taxi fleet, shared taxis can save 28.3 million gallons of gasoline and reduce 186 tons VOC, 199 tons NOx, 53 tons PM10, 25 tons PM2.5, and 2392 tons CO emissions annually.}

In the power sector, ammonia is particularly relevant for long-term storage and energy import to achieve long-term, net-zero emission targets. Ammonia-derived electricity is being researched in gas turbines and steam turbines (coal co-firing) at power plant scale, and alkaline fuel cells fed with ammonia are being commercialized at smaller scales for off-grid power. In the mid to long term, the direct firing of ammonia in gas turbines seems to offer the lowest cost of electricity from ammonia in the power sector. In transport, ammonia has gained attention as the leading fuel for decarbonizing the maritime sector and shows commercial potential as a hydrogen carrier for refueling proton exchange membrane fuel cell vehicles. As a hydrogen carrier, the increased cost of ammonia cracking and purification must be offset by the reduced cost of storage, transport and other logistics costs compared to hydrogen. Finally, in industry, there are large demands for high-temperature heat that require combustible fuels, such as ammonia. The economic competitiveness of ammonia in providing industrial heat depends on the availability and cost of alternative fuels at the industrial user, including biomass and low-carbon hydrogen, as well as carbon capture and storage at the industrial site. Overall, ammonia is likely to be a competitive energy vector provided economic incentives (such as carbon prices) and a continual reduction in production cost. In looking towards a net-zero future, ammonia may have abundant applications for energy purposes, as there are few alternatives with the same scalability and economic competitiveness.}

abstract = {Abattoir surveillance for Johne’s disease monitoring in Australia has provided valuable feedback to producers about their flock’s disease status since its commencement in 1999. The current surveillance system relies on the identification of gross lesions in sheep carcases at an abattoir, followed by sampling and histopathology testing. This manual inspection system has not been adapted to meet the changing disease situation, as infection prevalence levels have declined over time due to vaccination. This simulation study compares the current system with two alternative approaches utilising a validated quantitative (q)PCR method for the detection of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis in tissues, with random systematic sampling either alone or in conjunction with sampling of a single carcass presenting gross lesions. Consigned sheep were randomly simulated as either infected or uninfected according to defined prevalence levels of infection, with varying histopathological lesion severity and the presence or absence of gross lesions. These sheep were then allocated into multiple ‘lines’ (group of sheep slaughtered together) within each consignment, with each line subjected to testing with the three sampling strategies for the estimation of line and flock (consignment) sensitivity. The line sensitivity described the proportion of infected lines that tested positive, whereas the flock sensitivity was the proportion of consignments from the simulated infected flocks that had one or more lines test positive for paratuberculosis infection. The tissue qPCR strategy with gross lesion detection achieved marginally higher line sensitivity than the current abattoir surveillance strategy. The simulation of unvaccinated infected flocks with low to moderate prevalence levels demonstrated similar flock sensitivity for all three sampling models. However, the current strategy had very low line sensitivity for the simulated vaccinated infected flocks when the infection prevalence level was <2%. There were substantial differences in flock sensitivity between the two tissue qPCR approaches and the current abattoir surveillance strategy for vaccinated infected flocks, whereas, only marginal differences in flock sensitivity were evident between the two tissue qPCR models. Our results demonstrate that the current strategy is not effective at identifying infected animals at very low infection prevalence levels. The tissue qPCR approach investigated in this study is better as it removes the reliance on meat inspectors to identify gross lesions and can also assist in identifying flocks that have subclinical infected sheep not displaying gross lesions. Therefore, the sheep industry may benefit from incorporating tissue qPCR for Johne's disease surveillance, however the logistics and costs of conducting this type of testing would need to be considered prior to implementing any changes.}

abstract = {In this work, based on nonlinear robust control theory and computer virtual simulation technology with driving environment identification, we propose a robust controller and design a dynamic simulation analysis system for tractor-semitrailer with interference on rainy slippery road, and this work’s purpose is to solve the virtual simulation analysis problem nonlinear vehicle systems and improve those vehicles safety under harsh environment. Firstly, a verified 6DOF vehicle model with nonlinear tire based on vehicle simulation and analysis data was proposed with external interferences. Jacobian matrix eigenvalues criterion and 3D phase space portrait method were employed for investigating vehicle bifurcations, with crosswind and pavement interferences. Then, the nonlinear bifurcation of the vehicle is analyzed. And, based on robust control theory, taken the tractor yaw rate and joint angle as control objects, a MIMO H∞ dual feedback synthetic controller with strategy for active front wheel steering (AFS) and direct yaw moment control (DYC) was designed. Furthermore, we have built a new computer dynamic virtual simulation and analyzing system prototype. Finally, the simulation results reveal that Hopf bifurcations are identified with interferences, various equilibrium forms of stability are visualized as well. And the designed controller has good effect on eliminating bifurcations and improving robust stability of tractor-semitrailer with crosswind interference and parameter perturbation on lower adhesion road. It is a valuable reference for tractor-semitrailer safety design and nonlinear analysis under harsh environment, and it also give a useful reference to future intelligent logistics truck platoon design and nonlinear dynamic control.}

Research and public interest in urban food forests is increasing in Canada, yet their place in municipal urban forest management is unclear. To better understand how urban food forests intersect with current urban forest management imperatives, we analyzed urban forest management plans from 47 municipalities across Canada to discern if and how urban food forests are incorporated. Through a content analysis, we found that inclusion of urban food forests and related terms was very uneven in the management plans, with less than one-third of the plans directly considering urban food forests. When food forests are mentioned in plans, common contextual themes were species diversity, food security and specific management dimensions. These findings suggest that urban food forests are only beginning to gain recognition in Canadian municipal urban forest management, particularly in cases when food trees can contribute to existing goals like increasing species diversity. To fully address all of the potential and challenges associated with urban food forests in Canada, a wider set of socio-ecological considerations is required by researchers and policy-makers.}

Early studies have revealed promising economic and environmental benefits for the users of autonomous vessels which potentially results in lower operational costs and higher safety levels. Furthermore, many researchers believe that with the current technology, it is achievable to develop and run unmanned ships capable of meeting safety and operational standards. However, future implications of unmanned vessels for the maritime industry are diverse, difficult to measure and unknown to some extent. The maritime industry is a complex industrial sector encompassing various players involved in transport, logistics, regulatory, engineering, finance and insurance activities which are vertically and horizontally intertwined. Therefore, introducing autonomous vessels will not only transform the way vessels are operated across international waters, but also comes with major ramifications for all players involved in providing an end-to-end freight transport solutions. Given this gap, this chapter's objective is to explore the policy implications of autonomous ships for the maritime industry. Our exploration identifies new cost implications and asset management challenges, examines the likely impacts of embracing autonomous ships on port and shipbuilding sectors, and also, provides an industry maturity framework and debates the potential impacts of unmanned vessels on different shipping markets.}

Based on GIS and existing key ecological spaces, timely threat warnings to regional ecological spaces caused by artificial land-use changes and the identification of appropriate precautionary measures are necessary for the sustainable development of regional land resources. Taking 2010 as the base year, the study forecasts the demand for new construction land in the surveyed region in 2015 and 2030 using a Markov model; on this basis, a logistic cellular automata (CA) model is built to forecast the land use distribution related to construction land expansion and requisition-compensationbalanceofcultivated land. An OA value of 85.05% and a Kappa coefficient of 77.48% indicate a good simulation accuracy. By overlaying the existing regional key ecological spaces with the forecasted distribution of land-use changes, potential ecological security alerts are derived from the regional land-use changes. Results show that according to the current development mode, by 2030, the regional ecological security in the study area will be threatened by 35% of the new construction land and 80% of the supplementary cultivated land. The early warning mechanism for land-use ecological security can effectively forewarn the ecological threats derived from land use, thus helping decision makers to prevent risks in advance. Finally, the corresponding precautionary strategy is put forward.}

Conventionally, value chains in the waste sector have considered OFMSW and WW as unwanted by-products as opposed to potential valuable resources. Full exploitation of these resources calls for a value chain transformation towards proactive resource recovery. This study focuses on the waste supply chain optimisation to recover value added products from OFMSW. The research leads to a systems-modelling approach, which integrates spatial data analyses, mathematical mixed integer linear programming (MILP) optimisation and technology performance evaluation to inform the design of waste-to-resource value chains. A UK based study on OFMSW is presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the approach. The study captures variation in OFMSW quantity and composition, incorporating over 600 existing anaerobic digestion (AD) operational plants in the UK, while potential sites for new waste-recovery facilities are identified, accounting for transportation and logistics, using a GIS-based analysis. Key outcomes are analysed (technology type, size, location, logistical connections), placing emphasis on the need to consider the value of the resource recovery potential over the lifetime of an AD or thermochemical treatment facility in the design process. Such an approach offers a promising pathway for tackling the open challenges currently hindering the waste-to-resource transformation.}

Particularly, the authors focus on the inland waterway transport (IWT) connecting Phnom Penh (PP) and Ho Chi Minh (HCM) via the Lower Mekong Delta and identify obstacles and issues which need to be addressed for enhancing barge navigation along the Mekong River, including infrastructure, administration, and operation of the IWT. Thus, simulations of the proposed measures to facilitate IWT are examined by using the intermodal cargo flow assignment model. As a result, the model could describe well the actual shares of the route of hinterland transport (or gateway port) for Cambodian international laden containers. Moreover, the expected impacts in the simulation are reasonable as a whole; the improvement of IWT will increase its share, whereas the change of road transport conditions will bring both positive and negative impacts on its share. Although the simulations described in this chapter only focus on the reduction in shipping cost through the real 24-h-a-day operation at the national border and the vessel enlargement, more additional facilitations between two countries, including not only the policies mentioned above but also the improvement of river channels and canals, could reduce more the shipping cost and time. Additionally, increasing the number of ports covered by IWT services in both Cambodia and Vietnam, not only the PP port, will raise the viability of the service, although the cabotage issue should be solved.}

abstract = {With the substantial growth of logistics businesses the need for larger warehouses and their automation arises, thus using robots as assistants to human workers is becoming a priority. In order to operate efficiently and safely, robot assistants or the supervising system should recognize human intentions in real-time. Theory of Mind (ToM) is an intuitive human conception of other humans’ mental state, i.e., beliefs and desires, and how they cause behavior. In this paper we propose a ToM based human intention estimation algorithm for flexible robotized warehouses. We observe human’s, i.e., worker’s motion and validate it with respect to the goal locations using generalized Voronoi diagram based path planning. These observations are then processed by the proposed hidden Markov model framework which estimates worker intentions in an online manner, capable of handling changing environments. To test the proposed intention estimation we ran experiments in a real-world laboratory warehouse with a worker wearing Microsoft Hololens augmented reality glasses. Furthermore, in order to demonstrate the scalability of the approach to larger warehouses, we propose to use virtual reality digital warehouse twins in order to realistically simulate worker behavior. We conducted intention estimation experiments in the larger warehouse digital twin with up to 24 running robots. We demonstrate that the proposed framework estimates warehouse worker intentions precisely and in the end we discuss the experimental results.}

abstract = {In recent years, established and well-known grocery retailers have increasingly been investing in the business of micro stores and petrol station shops. Supplying these stores with perishable and durable goods leads to noticeable logistics challenges for the retailers. Since the total sales volumes of these shops are typically low and the respective sales areas are very limited, highly frequent deliveries of small sizes are required. These noticeably affect a number of operational planning problems. In the warehouse, the items requested have to be collected in small order sizes. In order to achieve efficient picking operations, orders are therefore combined into larger picking orders, i.e., batches. Afterwards the orders have to be delivered to the stores at high frequency. In practice, all the planning problems mentioned are heavily interconnected due to the short planning horizon. Despite the practical relevance, order batching, order picking and delivery operations have not so far been investigated as an integrative planning problem. This paper therefore presents a novel modeling and solution approach to solve practically relevant problem sizes. The combinatorial complexity of the problem requires a heuristic solution approach. We propose an extension of the well-known Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) metaheuristic that we call General ALNS (GALNS), and show that a GALNS approach outperforms a similar ALNS algorithm in 96.35% of the problem instances generated. Managerial insights from general problem data and a case study with a large German grocery retailer support the applicability of the modeling and solution approach suggested in retail practice.}

A growing number of studies seek to gauge the public's risk beliefs about drone delivery and inform policy development before its widespread uptake. Complicating these efforts is the fact that beliefs are interconnected and embedded in a cognitive system. This article argues that public outcomes are not based on atomized and isolated beliefs about risks involved in drone delivery, but instead emerge from the patterns in the relationships among these expressed beliefs. However, little is known about the structural characteristics of risk belief systems related to drone delivery, and the implications for risk communication and management. In an effort to fill this void, we conducted a network analysis of risk beliefs about drone delivery based on nationally representative data (N = 1465). The results revealed structural connections among 11 risk beliefs and explored structural variations in the risk belief system between people with different attitudes toward drone delivery. The simulation results showed that risk-mitigating messages instigated greater changes to the public's risk perceptions when they targeted structurally central, as opposed to peripheral, risk beliefs. The reported evidence adds new insights into how risks about drone delivery are configured in the public consciousness, and provides guidance into how practitioners may mobilize structural leverage to optimize the effectiveness and efficiency of risk communication strategies.}

Today, a myriad of real-world scenarios can benefit from the application of robots, such as structural health monitoring, complex manufacturing, efficient logistics or disaster management. Related to this topic, there is a paradigm connected to Swarm Intelligence which is grasping significant interest from the Computational Intelligence community. This branch of knowledge is known as Swarm Robotics, which refers to the development of tools and techniques to ease the coordination of multiple small-sized robots towards the accomplishment of difficult tasks or missions in a collaborative fashion. The success of Swarm Robotics applications comes from the efficient use of smart sensing, communication and organization functionalities endowed to these small robots, which allow for collaborative information sensing, operation and knowledge inference from the environment. The numerous industrial and social applications that can be addressed efficiently by virtue of swarm robotics unleashes a vibrant research area focused on distributing intelligence among autonomous agents with simple behavioral rules and communication schedules, yet potentially capable of realizing the most complex tasks. In this context, we present and overview recent contributions reported around this paradigm, which serves as an exemplary excerpt of the potential of Swarm Robotics to become a major research catalyst of the Computational Intelligence arena in years to come.}

Agile manufacturing strategies adopted by SMEs are driving the usage of collaborative robots in today’s factories. Major challenges in the adoption of cobots in the industry are the lack of a highly trained workforce to program the robot to perform complex tasks and integration of robot systems to other smart devices in the factory. In addition, the teaching and simulation by non-robotics experts of many industrial collaborative robot systems like the KUKA LBR iiwa is a major challenge, since these systems are designed to be programmed by robot experts and not by shop floor workers or other nonexperts. This paper describes the research and development activities done for reducing the barriers in operation and ensure holistic integration of LBR iiwa cobot in the assembly on the example of the ESB Logistics Learning Factory. These include a visual programming solution for the easy teaching of various tasks. Robotics tasks are classified based on common robotics applications and application-specific blocks abstracting specific actions are implemented. A factory worker with no programming competency could create robot programs by combining these blocks using a Graphical User Interface. In addition, a simulation solution was developed to visualize, analyse, and optimize robotic workflow before deployment. An autonomous mobile robot is integrated with the LBR iiwa to improve reconfigurability and thus also the productivity. The system as a whole is controlled using an event-driven distributed control system. Finally, the capabilities of the system are analysed based on the design principles of Industrie 4.0 and potential future research ideas are discussed to further improve the system.}

The aim of this article is to understand critical success and risk factors of eco-innovative business models that contribute to a circular economy via agricultural unavoidable waste or by-products valorisation. 39 cases were studied focusing on agricultural side stream conversion into valuable products. Semi-structured interviews were performed and secondary data collected. Cases were analysed according to types of initiatives, main objectives, resources and valorisation pathways, as well as external and internal factors that have influenced the businesses over time. Following success and risk factor categories are identified: (1) technical and logistic, (2) economic, financial and marketing, (3) organisational and spatial, (4) institutional and legal, (5) environmental, social and cultural. Herein, specific factors for the agricultural sector are innovative conversion technologies, flexible in and out logistics, joint investments in R&D, price competitiveness for bio-based products, partnerships with research organisations, space availability, subsidies, agricultural waste management regulations, local stakeholder involvement and acceptance of bio-based production processes. Insights from this study can help farmers and agribusiness managers by defining and adapting their strategies within their local contexts. They also show that for shifting from linear agro-food chains to a circular system, individual businesses need to evolve towards more dynamic and integrated business models, in which the macro-environment sets the boundary conditions for successful operations.}

The World Health Organization (WHO) established the Global Plan for Insecticide Resistance Management (GPIRM) in 2012. In that context, both classical and molecular tools, as well as entomological databases and decision support platforms have been developed and used for IRM. Despite major advances in the molecular elucidation of resistance mechanisms and the development of diagnostic tools, their impact on disease control programs has been limited. In most cases diagnostic tools provide a retrospective examination of changes imposed by insecticides rather than a prospective analysis to guide vector control strategies. The uncertainty of the predictive value of markers, the assay robustness and the common misconceptions in resistance diagnosis terminology are continuing challenges in monitoring vector resistance. Furthermore, an often logistics, as opposed to systematic scientific evidence, based approach to decision for the use of the very few alternative chemicals in vector control, has reduced the value of resistance monitoring in practice. The current deployment of new insecticidal active ingredients should necessitate the application of companion diagnostics (CDx) and the development of modern ways for interpretation and management of the data by trained programme managers. This will establish their real value for use in decision-making, in line with evidence based choice of chemicals in agriculture and medical applications.}

Yet it competes with Earth-based resources, in a complex trade-off involving both tech development & socioeconomic dynamics. This study models the size vs. time of a future resource ecosystem focused on water for exploration and satellite refueling, in cis-lunar space. We use a recently-developed multi-methodology concept based on System Dynamics and scenario planning, characterizing uncertainties. Top critical uncertainties include the accessibility of resource finds, and government investment into lunar resources, demarcating 2 particularly illustrative scenarios: Moonopolis and Apollo 2.0 — a rosy and a low-resources future. Concurrently, a System Dynamics model with 7 interacting systems is developed: exploration, production, demand, satellite industry, R&D, natural resources, and government. It is based on models of other industries (e.g. oil) and can express the scenarios. Uncertainties in 25 variables are estimated, and sensitivity analysis of ecosystem size is performed globally using variance-based measures, including interaction effects. These show (a) systems are tightly coupled, (b) variable importance is sensitive to the baseline. Three variables are crucial: government support to production development, production firms’ re-investment, and growth of the GEO telecom satellite industry. A lunar resources ecosystem with $32B economic impact after 20 years is plausible, given excellent government support to production capacity, high growth in GEO satellites, early demand and large initial resource discoveries. The main contributions are a novel holistic model of the dynamics of a space resources industry showing how to mix technical & socioeconomic parts, and a first case study of the methodology.}

abstract = {Peer-to-peer logistics platforms coordinate independent drivers to fulfill requests for last mile delivery and ridesharing. To balance demand-side performance with driver autonomy, a new stochastic methodology provides drivers with a small but personalized menu of requests to choose from. This creates a Stackelberg game, in which the platform leads by deciding what menu of requests to send to drivers, and the drivers follow by selecting which request(s) they are willing to fulfill from their received menus. Determining optimal menus, menu size, and request overlaps in menus is complex as the platform has limited knowledge of drivers’ request preferences. Exploiting the problem structure when drivers signal willingness to participate, we reformulate our problem as an equivalent single-level Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) and apply the Sample Average Approximation (SAA) method. Computational tests recommend a training sample size for inputted SAA scenarios and a test sample size for completing performance analysis. Our stochastic optimization approach performs better than current approaches, as well as deterministic optimization alternatives. A simplified formulation ignoring ‘unhappy drivers’ who accept requests but are not matched is shown to produce similar objective values with a fraction of the runtime. A ridesharing case study of the Chicago Regional transportation network provides insights for a platform wanting to provide driver autonomy via menu creation. The proposed methods achieved high demand performance as long as the drivers are well compensated (e.g., even when drivers are allowed to reject requests, on average over 90% of requests are fulfilled when 80% of the fare goes to drivers; this drops to below 60% when only 40% of the fare goes to drivers). Thus, neither the platform nor the drivers benefit from low driver compensation due to its resulting low driver participation and thus low request fulfillment. Finally, for the cases tested, a maximum menu size of 5 is recommended as it produces good quality platform solutions without requiring much driver selection time.}

abstract = {Context
Reports from patients and health care workers dealing with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) underscore experiences of isolation and fear. Some of this experience results from the distancing effect of masks, gloves, and gowns known as personal protective equipment (PPE). One approach to bridging the divide created by PPE is the use of PPE portraits, postcard-sized pictures affixed to PPE.
Objectives
Our confidential electronic mail-based survey aimed to quantify provider attitudes toward PPE portraits.
Methods
PPE portraits were piloted at an academic safety-net health system experiencing a COVID-19 patient surge during April–May 2020, necessitating use of full PPE for COVID-positive patients and surgical masks in all hospital settings. Our survey assessed staff exposure to PPE portraits, attitudes toward PPE portraits, and potential program expansion. For staff wearing PPE portraits, we also assessed perceptions of interactions with other staff and patients/families and impact on personal well-being. The University of Massachusetts Medical School's Institutional Review Board designated this as a quality improvement project (#H00020279).
Results
More than half of survey respondents (n = 111 of 173; 64%) reported exposure to PPE portraits. Attitudes toward PPE portraits were positive overall, with agreement that PPE portraits were a good idea (89%), improved provider mood (79%), enhanced perception of team connection (72%), and more positive among those who reported exposure. Open-ended responses (n = 41) reinforced positive survey data and also raised concerns about infection control (n = 6), cost/logistics (n = 5), and provider vulnerability (n = 3).
Conclusion
Providers report that PPE portraits may represent a positive patient-centered idea that helps reassure patients, is well received by interdisciplinary staff, and may enhance patient and team interactions. Potential adaptations to address concerns include photo pins and donor/patient and family experience department support for costs.}

abstract = {Digital twin (DT) technology is essential for achieving the fusion of virtual-real cyber-physical systems. Academics and companies have made great strides in the theoretical research and case studies of constructing the shop-floor digital twin (SDT), which is the premise of applying DT technology on the shop floor. A shop floor is a large complex system that involves many elements including people, machines, materials, methods, and the environment and processes, such as the technical flow, business process, logistics, and control flow. However, most of the developed cases lack a hierarchical, structured and modularized implementation framework for the development of an SDT system, which leads to problems such as a low reuse rate of the system blocks, lack of scalability, and high upgrade and maintenance costs. In response to these issues, we propose a construction method of the DT for the shop floor based on model-based systems engineering from the perspective of the system. In this method, a comprehensive DT model for the shop floor is gradually constructed by using system modeling language, the modeling method “MagicGrid,” and the “V model” of systems engineering. The model includes four dimensions of the shop-floor requirements, structure, behavior, and parameters, as well as three stages (the problem domain, solution domain, and implementation domain), and connects nine steps of the “V model,” including the system requirements, system architecture, subsystem implementation, subsystem integration, and system verification. Then, based on an example of a real NC machining shop floor, subsystems including a visualization system, synchronization system, and simulation system, are discussed. Finally, the functions of the integrated systems are verified based on the requirements, including the real-time synchronization of “man, machine, material, and method” and the transient simulation in real time. The numerical indicators of the integrated system are verified, including the model completeness and synchronization timeliness.}

Five reorganization stages were described during the crisis (from week 11 to week 21 in 2020): preparatory stage, 1st organizational stage, wait-and-see stage, 2nd organizational stage, and progressive return stage. The number of patients seen on-site decreased 64% in 2020 compared to 2019, while 78% of consultations were canceled. The logistics (teleconsultation, dedicated COVID-19 patient pathways) and human resources (sick leave, telework, reassignment to other departments) were adapted to ensure that patients who are usually seen in our hand surgery department received adequate care.
Résumé
La crise sanitaire COVID-19 a fortement impacté l’organisation des services de consultations externes, notamment en chirurgie de la main. Cinq phases de réorganisation des consultations externes ont été décrites durant la crise (de la semaine 11 à la semaine 21 en 2020) : une phase préparatoire, une 1ère phase organisationnelle, une phase attentiste, une 2nde phase organisationnelle et une phase de reprise progressive. Le nombre de patients venus en présentiel a baissé en 2020 par rapport à 2019 de 64.5% tandis que 78.2% des créneaux de consultations ont été annulés. Une adaptation des moyens logistiques (téléconsultations, circuits COVID-19) et des moyens humains (arrêts de travail, télétravail, réaffectation dans d’autres services) a été parallèlement instaurée au décours des semaines, ce qui a permis une poursuite adaptée à la crise sanitaire, de la prise en charge des patients habituellement suivis en consultation de chirurgie de la main.}

abstract = {Efficient tracking of shipments is critical in managing global trade and logistics activities. The volume of global container movement combined with information opaqueness and process complexity necessitates implementing a robust technology solution with real time tracking capabilities. Blockchain is an emerging technology that offers the necessary platform to track and manage shipment movements in the supply chain using a peer-to-peer, secured, distributed ledger, and without intermediaries or trusted third parties. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based solution for efficient supply chain management involving items shipped via smart containers. Our proposed solution utilizes the features of smart contracts in Ethereum blockchain to govern and manage interactions between the sender and receiver. Shipped items are included in smart containers equipped with Internet of Things (IoT) sensors that can be used to track and monitor predefined shipping conditions related to temperature, geographical location, humidity, pressure, light exposure, sudden fall, broken seal, etc. Ethereum smart contracts are used to manage shipment conditions, automate payments, legitimize receiver and also issue a refund in case of violations to predefined conditions. In the paper, we present and discuss key aspects related to architectural design, entity relations, interactions among participants, information flow, implementation and testing of the overall system functionality with a potential business case applied to vaccine supply chain. The Smart contracts were implemented in Solidity language and tested using Remix IDE environment, the code has been made publicly available for academic, research and practice community.}
