abstract = {In service-oriented manufacturing models, manufacturing resources in different enterprises are integrated and shared through network, cloud platforms, and logistics. On cloud manufacturing platforms, service providers offer on-demand manufacturing services to service demanders according to supply-demand matching results. As a special type of manufacturing services, logistics services provide transportation capabilities for production services and demanders. It is a critical issue to schedule logistics services efficiently, especially when manufacturer selections have been planned. This research focuses on the logistics scheduling problem in cloud manufacturing with pre-selected manufacturers. We analyze this optimization problem from aspects of tasks, production services, logistics services, and optimization objectives. Then a logistics scheduling method is proposed to reduce the average delivery time from manufacturers to customers. In the proposed method, the total time from start points of logistics to demanders is considered to reduce the average delivery time of all tasks. Based on four different scenarios, we build their scheduling models and run simulations to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Results show that the average task delivery time of the proposed method is shorter than three typical strategies.}

abstract = {Interoperability is playing an increasing role for today’s logistics and supply chain management (LSCM) because of the trends of cooperation or coopetition. Especially, digital interoperability concerning data or information exchange becomes a key enabler for the next evolutions that will massively rely upon digitalization, artificial intelligence, and autonomous systems. The notion of Physical Internet (PI) is one such evolution, an innovative worldwide logistic paradigm aimed at interconnecting and coordinating logistics networks for efficiency and sustainability. This paper investigates how digital interoperability can help interconnect logistics and supply networks as well as the operational solutions for sustainable development, and examines the new challenges and research opportunities for digital interoperability under the PI paradigm. To this end, we study the most relevant technologies for digital interoperability in LSCM, via a bibliometric analysis based on 208 papers published during 2010−2020. The results reveal that the present state-of-the-art solutions of digital interoperability are not fully aligned with PI requirements and show new challenges, research gaps and opportunities that need further discussion. Accordingly, several research avenues are suggested to advance research and applications in this area, and to achieve interconnection in logistics and supply networks for sustainability.}

The objective of this paper is to offer guidance on the best way to design urban logistics hubs for cooperative use by different courier-, express and parcel service providers (CEPs). The present research used a set of different methods to collect a substantial amount of qualitative and quantitative data. The example of Vienna (Austria) offers real-world data. The research paper identifies suitable attributes for describing different CEP user types and uses a linear optimisation model to suggest an optimal allocation of the shared infrastructure capacity. The optimisation model aims to maximise the total utility of hub space utilisation throughout an average working day. It assumes that the utility increases with the hub’s occupancy rate and the convergence of its CEP user types with the administration’s and the citizens’ vision of future city development. The results show that involved stakeholder groups – i.e. CEPs, citizens and city administrations – have both, conflicting and common goals.}

abstract = {We consider an NP-hard selective and periodic inventory routing problem (SPIRP) in a waste vegetable oil collection environment. This SPIRP arises in the context of reverse logistics where a biodiesel company has daily requirements of oil to be used as raw material in its production process. These requirements can be fulfilled by using the available inventory, collecting waste vegetable oil or purchasing virgin oil. The problem consists in determining a period (cyclic) planning for the collection and purchasing of oil such that the total collection, inventory and purchasing costs are minimized, while meeting the company’s oil requirements and all the operational constraints. We propose a MIP-based heuristic which solves a relaxed model without routing, constructs routes taking into account the relaxation’s solution and then improves these routes by solving the capacitated vehicle routing problem associated to each period. Following this approach, an a posteriori performance guarantee is ensured, as the approach provides both a lower bound and a feasible solution. The performed computational experiments show that the MIP-based heuristic is very fast and effective as it is able to encounter near optimal solutions with low gaps within seconds, improving several of the best known results using just a fraction of the time spent by a state-of-the-art heuristic. A remarkable fact is that the proposed MIP-based heuristic improves over the best known results for all the large instances available in the literature.}

There is high consumption of papaya in Yasothon municipality but a lack of papaya plantations in the area lead to a vast amount import of papaya. The study developed a green supply chain and logistics model, using network analysis. The best route for each significant case was the shortest route of the total distance from each registered stop. The results of the analysis revealed that papaya distributed from Ubon Ratchathani and Sisaket Farms should use the route generated by driving and distance impedance with the lowest greenhouse gas emissions at 898.42 kg CO2 eq./FU. Meanwhile, the distribution from Nakorn Ratchasima should use the driving distance impedance to generate the route with the lowest greenhouse gas emissions at 987.37 k kg CO2 eq./FU. While the papaya supply chain from Kamphaeng Phet, Kanchanaburi, Lopburi, and Ratchaburi to Khon Kaen Market with driving distance impedance is the best solution among all the alternative routes as it generates the lowest greenhouse gas emissions at 6620.23 kg CO2 eq./FU. The results suggest that the distribution center can help reducing the distance, resulting in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The results of the study can suggest the sustainable index of the papaya supply chain by comparing the conventional and improved environmental impact of the papaya supply chain from the green logistics model. The alternatives will be the suggestion of pathways towards improvements in green supply chain and logistics of papaya, which can also be considered for implementation in other agricultural products.}

The paper focuses on the customers’ time requirements and establishes the penalty costs incurred when service time requirements are not met. In addition, this paper combines different aspects, such as considering the refrigeration energy consumption and the damage costs. Meanwhile, because of the different potential impacts of the various costs, different weights are assigned to each cost. Then, a cold chain logistics vehicle routing optimization model considering time windows is constructed. Finally, the Clarke–Wright (CW) algorithm, which is suitable for the model, is selected to solve the problem, and the validity of the model is verified by an example. The results of the calculation example show that although the transportation cost and energy cost of the optimized distribution route increase slightly, the optimized distribution route greatly reduces the total cost. Customer satisfaction and vehicle load rate have also increased significantly. Cost reduction and satisfaction improvement can sometimes be achieved at the same time. Using mathematical methods to plan routes can help companies save costs. And help planners and delivery staff to improve the timeliness of the last-mile delivery. Simplify complex algorithms without having to use professional software. More ordinary employees can also use this method.}

Obviously, such port-centric logistics may impact the operations in the hinterland substantially and could potentially reduce opportunities for intermodal transport in the hinterland. We analyze the interaction between port-centric logistics and hinterland intermodal transportation. We take a logistics service provider's perspective and we include some key elements in the model, such as detention fees, extra handling, transport efficiency and empty container repositioning. We develop new analytical results identifying the optimal market areas of truck-only transportation, port-centric logistics and hinterland intermodal transportation. Our results show that tension between port-centric logistics and hinterland intermodal transportation is quite likely to happen in practice. We additionally study the use of continental containers as a way to reconcile port-centric logistics and hinterland intermodal transportation and we derive further results. We illustrate our results via an example and we highlight managerial insights.}

The main aim of the article was to identify the function of ILCs and assess whether they could perform additional tasks of Urban Consolidation Centers (UCCs), in accordance with the assumptions of Sustainable Urban Freight Transport (SUFT). To this end, the following research methods were used: literature review, documentary method, and case study. The area of research focused on selected Italian ILCs, including: Interporto Qadrante Europa, Verona and Cityporto Padova, Padua. The research process proved the possibility of introducing new environmentally friendly solutions in Italian urban logistics. As an example, the authors presented the possibility of using innovative Light Freight Railway (LFR) system for handling transport between Interporto Sud Europa and selected cities. The case study showed that implementing LFR in the delivery of goods in urban areas may increase the functionality of Italian ILCs, thus enabling the implementation of SUFT assumptions and benefiting the environment and quality of life in society.

As known, the logistics concerns in the supply chain always play an important role to a manufacturing company, and decision on the selection of logistics service provider is a key point, especially for healthcare manufacture whose products are the medical devices or equipment of fragility and high cost. Practically there are so many logistics service providers with varieties in service quality, effectiveness, punctuality and reliability, that the manufacturers often encounter the challenge on the provider selection, and healthcare industry is no exception. However, the research on provider selection for healthcare manufacturers is quite limited. In order to help them to make the decision, this paper designs a logistics service provider selection scheme based on a novel weighted density-based hierarchical cluster analysis with integration of the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) for healthcare industry. Initially an evaluation index system reflecting the capability of the candidate providers in all aspects is established. To improve the clustering within the scheme, the density concept and the obtained weights are introduced into the traditional hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) to shape a novel Weighted Density-Based HCA (WDBHCA). To validate the feasibility of the scheme, a case study on a specified healthcare industry manufacturer is carried out, and results fulfill the case company’s requirement which shows the feasibility of the proposed provider selection scheme. In addition, this scheme can be applied to the provider selection in other fields, as well.}

The Underground Logistics System (ULS) is a sustainable option to overcome traffic congestion while improving freight transport efficiency. This study presents a comprehensive layout design and facility planning method for the two-echelon urban ULS network with hub-and-spoke structure. The underground network is organized by the primary and secondary ULS nodes and tunnels which have strong alignment with existing logistics nodes such as distribution centers and major demand terminals. A bi-objective mixed-integer linear programming model considering minimal costs and maximal system utilization was established to formulate the location-allocation of ULS nodes, tunnel layout and flow routing in the network. Given the inherent problem complexity, a series of simplification techniques and hybrid optimization procedures integrating both exact and meta-heuristic algorithms were developed to obtain high quality solutions. Finally, a real-world simulation was carried out in Beijing, China to demonstrate the applicability of proposed method. Results show that our procedures can effectively obtain the best configurations of ULS network under various scenarios and has better convergence efficiency and optimality performance. Moreover, a group of horizontal tests and sensitivity analysis reveals further insights regarding ULS network decision-making and layout strategies.}

Finally, using MATLAB tools to analyze the data. Results show that economic growth is the main factor to promote carbon emissions in logistics industry, followed by the positive impact of population size and energy structure. The carbon factor effect is negligible, energy intensity is the main restraining factor. The effect of various factors on carbon emissions varies from time to time. Therefore, we should speed up the adjustment of energy structure, reduce the dependence on high‑carbon emissions such as coal, optimize transportation system and improve logistics efficiency; at the same time, strengthen the cooperation between the government and enterprises, formulate feasible policies and measures, and do a good job in top-level planning and design of logistics, make our logistics industry embark on the road of low-carbon development.}

The intention is to create and expand green and sustainable supply chains (SSC) to meet environmental and economic standards and to boost one’s position in competitive markets. This study examines the resilient sustainable reverse logistics network (RLN) process for end-of-life vehicles (ELVs) in Iran. We pursue both actual and uncertain situations that possess big data characteristics (3 V’s) in information between facilities of the proposed reverse logistics (RL), and we consider recycling technology due to its societal impacts. Due to unpredictable environmental and social factors, the various proposed network facilities may not utilize their full capacity, so we also consider situations in which the network facility capacity is disrupted. Our primary objective is to minimize the total cost of the resilient sustainable RLN. For most parameters, finding the best solution through traditional methods is time-consuming and costly. Hence, to enhance decision-making power, the value of model parameters in each scenario is considered. A Cross-Entropy (CE) algorithm with basic scenario concepts is used in robust model optimization. The results demonstrate that changing the scenario situation significantly impacts optimal environmental and social costs. In particular, when the situation is “pessimistic,” environmental impact costs are at their highest levels. Hence, scenario-based modeling of the network is a good approach to implement under uncertainty conditions. On the other hand, results show that cost savings for organizations are achieved through optimal planning of the centers' capacity to save cost, increase services, and ensure effective government response to cost-effective and instrumental market competition.}

Based on the principles of sustainable development, in a decision/production process, managers and policymakers should not only have economic concerns but also consider social and environmental issues. In this regard, local and national governments have been convinced to intervene in supply chains mostly by imposing subsidies and/or taxes to make their activities more sustainable. Accordingly, designing sustainable supply chains has turned into a critical issue for both managers and researchers in different industries. Transportation and distribution represent two of the most unsustainable steps in any supply chain; cooperation with Third-Party Logistics (3PL) companies could help to make these steps sustainable. The main purpose of this study is to investigate the issue of sustainable supply chain management under the presence of the government and through the application of an outsourcing strategy to a 3PL company in the transportation sector. The problem is studied according to different formats of competition, decision-making, number of players, and public awareness. Considering different decision structures, the game theory is applied to model the problem and obtain the equilibrium values. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is conducted on each model, and some numerical examples are solved to show how applicable the models are. The results show that cooperation with 3PLs in a supply chain enhances the public awareness about environmental issues and promotes the sustainability of the supply chain. Governmental tariffs can also serve as practical tools to push supply chains towards sustainable strategies.}

Analysis of survey data from 232 French TPLs indicate that improved performance depends on the type of TPL organizational core that is mobilized by the PES. Indeed, while the PES of the operations function can improve both environmental and economic performances, the PES of the marketing function contributes only to improved economic performance. The results also reveal that eco-control systems play a prominent role in fostering TPL environmental performance while economic performance remains unchanged. In this regard, eco-control systems can help TPL managers deploy their strategic environmental intentions and achieve improved environmental performance by motivating and directing employees along environmental purposes, providing key information related to environmental activities, and prompting opportunity-seeking behaviors. Overall, the study answers recent calls for research on the green initiatives of TPLs and provides novel insights that can spur on further research.}

Traditional logistics monitoring is usually manually recorded, which not only wastes manpower and is inefficient, but also cannot meet the current scale and intelligent development requirements of the logistics industry. The purpose of this article is to study modern logistics monitoring systems based on sensor networks and big data. Based on the in-depth study of three technologies of sensor network, big data and logistics technology, this article integrates the entire warehousing and distribution logistics process, and builds a monitoring system framework combining sensor network and big data based on the wireless sensor network software and hardware platform. Combining the two key methods studied in this paper, the information management process of traditional logistics operations such as outbound and inbound, warehousing positioning and monitoring, and distribution monitoring management are implemented, and the monitoring system is tested on this basis. The test results prove that this system has certain deployment reference significance and practical application value, and can help to improve the informationization and intelligence level of logistics management to a certain extent. In this paper, by simulating 250 concurrent users, the server CPU usage is 56.37%, the server memory usage is 57.13%, and the response time is 1944 ms.}

Further, the mediating effects of environmental performance, social performance and market performance between green logistics management practices and financial performance are examined. The study uses dataset gathered from 240 firms across three industries (entertainment, manufacturing and logistics) using structured questionnaires. The structural equation modelling partial least square (Smartpls software 3.2.8) is used to simultaneously test both the direct and indirect relationships between the variables. The results indicate that green logistics management practices has significant positive influence on environmental performance while it insignificantly influences social, market and financial performances. Besides, environmental performance mediates green logistics management practices and financial, social and market performances, while social performance fails to mediate the influence of both green logistics management practices and environmental performance on financial performance. This study expands literature by obtaining the results for the conceptual model and dealing with the implication from the Ghanaian perspective, which is a lower middle-income economy to strike a balance between knowledge. The study reveals that the adoption of green logistics management practices has little influence on improving the social welfare and health of the society and employees while it improves financial performance through environmental and market performances.}

The objective of the paper is to investigate the effects of collaboration and IT competency in developing reverse logistics competency, as a strategy, and its consequences in economic and environmental performance. A survey was performed with 320 Brazilian supply chain executives and analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling. The models demonstrated that collaboration has a direct positive influence on the development of reverse logistics competency, by executives' point of view. The moderation effect between collaboration and IT competency for reverse logistics was not confirmed, since it was adopted a strategic view of reverse logistics. Therefore, despite there was not a moderation effect, IT presented a lower direct effect on reverse logistics competency. Results reinforce that organizations that develop reverse logistics competency tend to improve their economic and environmental performances.}

Reverse logistics is applied in the sustainable management of municipal waste and is used in the collection, recycling and reuse, as well as the reduction of consumables and environmental compatibility. One of the challenges of sustainable management is costs and customer demand must be considered simultaneously. In this paper, we try to address a comprehensive approach by applying fuzzy mathematical programming to design a multi-objective model for a reverse logistics network. To cover all aspects of this system, we tried to minimize the cost of facility construction, vehicle fuel and environmental damage from the emission of polluting gases, as well as minimize the sum of the ratio of unanswered customer demand to the amount of their demand for all periods, as objective functions of the model. In order to obtain solutions on the Pareto front, a customized multi-objective genetic algorithm (NSGAII) and a customized bee colony algorithm (BCO) were applied. The results of the two algorithms according to the indicators of quality comparison, spacing, diversification and solution time have been compared. The results showed that in all cases, the bee colony algorithm was better able to explore and extract the area to a feasible solution and to achieve near-optimal answers. In terms of spacing metric and resolution time, the genetic algorithm performed better than the bee algorithm.}

In general, scientific research concerned a much wider area, which was the assessment of the role of multifunctional economic spaces such as seaports, inland ports and integrated logistics centers in regional socio-economic systems. Nevertheless, this article focuses on presenting the results of one of the research sub-areas related to inland ports in Europe and their role in the urban logistics system. Inland ports play an increasingly important role in regional socio-economic systems in Europe. Whereas thirty years ago they were typical water-to-land transport nodes with a dominant transport function, many of them, like seaports, have also developed logistic, distribution and industrial functions. Thanks to the intermodal railway terminals and the container terminals located in their area, they function as integrated logistics centers, supporting not only long-distance water and land transport routes but also local transport routes beginning or ending in metropolitan areas, the part of which constitute these ports. An important factor here is the fact that the majority of inland ports, due to the location, is an element of cities or metropolitan areas. Therefore, these ports have become, in recent years, an internal element of the urban logistics system affecting its shape. Distribution centers operating in their area are elements of the urban delivery systems in which the ports operate. Freight transport routes often pass through adjacent metropolitan areas. Usually, inland ports of this type also have passenger terminals, where tourists visiting port cities create certain traffic flows. In the research process, using various research methods, the thesis was proven that inland ports functioning as integrated logistics centers are part of the logistics system of urban or metropolitan areas in which they operate.}

abstract = {The diversification of service portfolios is one of the key strategies employed by third-party logistics providers (3PLs) to remain competitive. Moving from traditional transportation and warehousing services, many 3PLs now offer a one-stop shopping experience to shippers by combining these services with customized offerings such as inventory management, integrated supply chain management, and consulting. Academic literature has identified key drivers of this phenomenon, such as the need to meet shippers’ increasing expectations, a 3PL’s strategic orientation, or to capitalize on existing resources and capabilities. Yet, work focused on the theoretical and empirical analysis of competitive drivers of 3PL diversification is scant. Grounded in competitive dynamics theory and the theory of strategic groups, we investigate the effects of the addition of new services by peer 3PLs on a focal 3PL’s diversification of service offerings. In particular, we hypothesize—and find based on the analysis of a large archival panel dataset—that a focal 3PL is more likely to expand its service portfolio when its peers introduce services that put them in direct competition with the focal 3PL. The same behavior is observed, though to a lesser extent and with longer time lags, when peers introduce services that the focal 3PL did not previously offer. The results also indicate that when there is greater similarity between the service portfolios of a focal firm and its peers, these relationships will be stronger. Collectively, these findings contribute to the logistics outsourcing and diversification literatures and offer refinements to competitive dynamics theory. Our work also offers managerial insights relevant to 3PL decision makers as they design their service portfolios.}

Logistics service sharing (LSS) among e-commerce firms provides more consumers with better service experience, but gives rise to new competition problem. In this paper, we study the LSS and the resulting competition problem in a dual-channel e-commerce supply chain consisting of a manufacturer and a retailer. The manufacturer wholesales products to the retailer who then retails them to consumers, and the manufacturer simultaneously sells the same products to consumers directly. The retailer owns superior logistics service resource, which can be shared with the manufacturer. We model two cases: without LSS and with LSS. For each case, we model the competition problem in this supply chain as a Stackelberg game, where the retailer acts as the leader and the manufacturer acts as the follower. Optimal decisions and profits of each firm as well as consumer surplus and social welfare in each case are provided. We find that compared to the case without LSS, in the case with LSS, the manufacturer’s retail price always increases, but the retailer’s retail price may increase or decrease, depending on the price of the shared logistics service. The profit change of the two firms also depends on the price of the shared logistics service. It is found that the two firms can be Pareto improved by LSS if this price lies in a certain range, which shrinks when the competition intensity increases. The social welfare with LSS will be greater than that without LSS when the price of the shared logistics service is less than a threshold.}

Its main functionality, the detection of loaded components and material, handles a high variety of identification principles that are defined by pre-existing processes. We therefore conceptualize smart sensor boards. Through a novel modularity structure, demand-driven equipment of these boards with different sensor types can be achieved. This includes AI-based, visual detection of components on delivery units. We display the versatility of our concept with a practical implementation based on low-cost sensors and demonstrate how our approach leads to demand-driven delivery units.}

abstract = {In e-commerce, the success of hybrid online platforms is well documented where the platform not only works as a retailer but also offers online marketplace services to sellers. Logistics service is one of the most expensive operations for e-commerce and plays a critical role in promoting online purchases. In most cases, the platform builds a self-supporting logistics service system to deliver its own products, and the seller outsources the logistics service to third-party logistics service providers (TPLPs). Recently, the e-commerce market has emerged with a new trend of business-to-business logistics service sharing—the platform shares its logistics service system with the seller. In this paper, we first analyze the strategic and economic impacts of logistics service sharing. Our analysis shows that whereas logistics service sharing will lead to a lose-win situation for the platform and the seller when the TPLP's logistics service level and the market potential are low, it will lead to a win-lose situation when the TPLP's logistics service level or the market potential is very high. Furthermore, a win-win situation can be achieved when the TPLP's logistics service level and the market potential are in the middle regions. Then, we examine the equilibrium mode by considering the strategic interactions between the platform and the seller. We find that when the TPLP's logistics service level and the market potential are relatively low, the equilibrium mode is No-Service-Sharing. As the TPLP's logistics service level, the market potential, or both increase, the equilibrium mode will evolve from No-Service-Sharing to Service-Sharing.}

The aim of this paper is to look at logistics sprawl patterns in the Gothenburg metropolitan area, in the south-west of Sweden. Looking at a medium-size monocentric urban region that is also a major port gateway for the country, this study provides novel elements in the study of locational patterns of freight facilities in metropolitan areas. It also provides an opportunity to identify the role of freight in planning, land use and zoning policies. A literature review is carried out on the issues of freight and logistics facilities locational patterns. A quantitative analysis is proposed, using data from Swedish statistics about the number of establishments with a NACE code related to logistics, as well as an original method providing a “cleaned” and more comprehensive dataset. We look at data at two different scales, one metropolitan and one regional, for years 2000 and 2014, as to enable a comparative and diachronical analysis. Logistics sprawl is measured by the average distance of warehouses to their common centre of gravity. Finally, interviews with transport and logistics providers as well as real estate investors and public agencies in the region, add qualitative information on the relative importance of different location factors related to logistics facilities and the issues raised. Logistics sprawl in Gothenburg occurs in specific ways, and differently at the two geographical levels of analysis.}

Thus, an important sector for connecting the collection and waste paper recycling echelons is the intermediate center. In this study, a Mixed Integer Linear Programming model, which is multi-objective, multi-product, multi-level and multi-period, was developed to optimize the waste paper logistics processes of intermediate centers. The formulation includes the following echelons: collection, considering vehicle routing with different capacities; inventory of non-baling materials; baling sorted waste and inventory of bales; selling bales; disposal of non-recyclable waste. The aims of the model include: maximizing the collected waste; minimizing distances; maximizing both the production and sale of bales, and minimizing costs. According to research carried out in the literature, the developed model is a new proposal and to implement it, the Weighted Goal Programming and Revised Multi-Choice Goal Programming approaches were used to deal with multiple objectives and incorporate uncertainty into the quantity of waste available for collection. To analyze the proposed model, computational tests were executed with instances based on real data from a Brazilian company in the sector. For all performed tests, General Algebraic Modeling System 23.6.5 modeling language and CPLEX 12.2.0.2 solver were used for modeling and optimization. The results show that this study presents formulation and technological approaches that represent real situations and provide competitive solutions to the problem.}

The results derived from the mined association rules based soft set theory present information risk can trigger all the other types of risk, of which information security risk is the most influential event. The risk of governing uncertainty triggered by information inaccuracy or information delay is distributed in the green warning level as well as the risk of uncertain inventory and contract disputes triggered by information inaccuracy, and the others in the yellow warning level. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the effective application of the approach of soft set based association rule to mining interrelationship between risk sets. The findings can help the maritime practitioners to make risk mitigation policies and encourage scholars to conduct more risk investigation in the systematic perspectives.}

One of the essential elements of an urban development system is to identify the appropriate location for a logistics center. In practice, the issue of evaluating and selecting the most suitable geographical area for a logistics center is considered as a complex decision making problem that can be well formulated through analytical and mathematical models. An exhaustive review of literature indicates that no concrete study has still proposed any integrated evaluation approach for logistics center selection. Thus, this paper aims in developing a two-stage decision making model to find out the most preferred zone in the autonomous communities of Spain for establishment of logistics centers. In the first stage, the considered communities are compared based on five evaluation criteria using data envelopment analysis (DEA) to identify the efficient and inefficient alternatives. In the second stage, a model is designed to evaluate the performance of the efficient communities using rough full consistency (R-FUCOM) and combined compromise solution (R-CoCoSo) methods. The adopted model allows capturing the uncertainty and vagueness in the decision makers’ judgments as involved in the evaluation process with the use of rough set theory (RST). The R-FUCOM method is utilized to obtain the optimal weights of the criteria, while R-CoCoSo method is finally used to rank the efficient communities. In addition, sensitivity analyses are performed to validate the robustness of the derived results.}

This implies that international supply chains, which typically involves sea transport as a key chain segment, could be subject to the double marginalisation problem. This means, chain operators are likely subject to both technical and allocative efficiency issues. The former is related to the use of inputs in production and distribution, and the latter is generally related to the market structure that affects resource allocation. The current study seeks to study the simultaneous relationships between three components, namely logistics integration, technical efficiency, and allocative efficiency in international container shipping. Exploratory factor analysis and structural equation modelling are conducted using data collected from a survey of global shipping lines. The analysis results show that logistics integration comprises of two main interrelated aspects, namely relational integration, and operational integration. It has significant effects on both technical and allocative efficiency. Technical efficiency and market contestability are affected by relational integration, while allocative efficiency and infrastructure capacity are affected by operational integration. Based on the analysis results, implications for port, terminals and stakeholders are also discussed.}

The e-retailer can purchase products directly from a manufacturer under its own brand or indirectly from a brand-name company and then deliver the products to consumers through logistics services. By comparing and analysing e-retailers’ procurement equilibrium strategies under different logistics, we find that e-retailers with different logistics systems have identical procurement preferences when the procurement cost is low or high. However, when the procurement cost is moderate, the e-retailer with third-party logistics is more motivated to adopt direct procurement. In addition, when indirect procurement has a smaller market influence, e-retailers are more inclined toward direct procurement even if the demand is more sensitive to brand-name products. Furthermore, under certain conditions, pricing rules are quite opposite between different procurement modes such that the price decreases even if the cost is more sensitive to the logistics service level in indirect procurement. Moreover, the brand-name company may set a lower resale price instead when improving quality becomes more expensive.}

A fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis of survey data from 232 TPLs shows that combined internal and external GSCM practices improve both operational and financial performances. However, taking into account the TPLs' size allows alternative combinations of GSCM practices: a combination of green supply and eco-design packaging improves small TPLs' performances, whereas a combination of all GSCM practices, except investment recovery and reverse logistics, improves large TPLs’ performances. By using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis instead of traditional linear methodologies, this study offers a new approach to determine the configurations of internal and external GSCM practices that lead to enhanced operational and financial performances in TPLs, rather than treating each GSCM practice separately.}

The CSR performance was proxied by the composite ESG (environmental, social, and governance) indicator as well as its three pillars. For this purpose, the data was derived from the Thomson Reuters Eikon database for the years between 2012 and 2018. According to the results, companies with greater CSR performance are more likely to publish a CSR report and companies with greater CSR performance are more likely to publish a higher number of CSR reports. Thus, the results confirm the validity of the signaling theory and reject greenwashing tendency in the logistics sector. Upon findings, we suggest several implications for the logistics sector, academics, firms, and shareholders as well as stakeholders. The proven link between CSR performance-reporting sends very important signals to shareholders and other stakeholders such that the information embedded in the reports reflect the actual realization of CSR practices.}

First, to simulate the trailer of a refrigerated vehicle, a box-like testbed is built. Second, a completed transportation task of a refrigerated vehicle is categorised into four modes according to the guidance for industry. And a compact supervisory system with four types of corresponding supervisory modules is designed to identify the current mode and detect improper practices with temperature data, the situations of the door, and the refrigeration system of the trailer. Third, a correlation matrix of the temperature and the door state data obtained from the testbed is derived. In light of the correlation matrix, data are rearranged into seven groups. Then such seven groups are used as the features of interest to classify the state of the door and the state of the refrigeration system by supervised machine learning models, such as decision tree, SVM, weighted k-NN algorithm, and ensemble method. After comparisons of their estimation performances, the optimal feature groups, and the optimal classification models of door state classification and refrigeration system state classification are selected. It means that the door and the refrigeration system states required by the compact supervisory system could be estimated by internal temperature data of the refrigerated trailer. Lastly, the validity of the proposed supervisory system is investigated with a light refrigerated vehicle.}

A commonality among these problems is that demand–supply incongruence is always observed in post-disaster logistics operations due to the limited relief supplies and the randomly increasing relief demands. In such situations, the decision maker fails to meet the total relief demands simultaneously. This study employs a novel decision-making framework, where the traditional disaster relief logistics actions (e.g., vehicles routing and relief allocation) are replaced by periodic, sequential actions involving demand point location and assignment. A sequential approach allows the decision maker, in the face of every demand-point, to decide whether to locate and assign it to relief suppliers immediately or later, which sequentially influences the decision in the next period. A dynamic optimization model is built and solved by using particle swarm optimization algorithm. The results of a case study indicate the advantages of the sequential approach.}

In this context, a logistical simulation tool has been developed to quantitatively evaluate and compare different reactor and maintenance concepts within the DEMO project. The overall goal is to support the decision-making process during both the design and operation phase of the fusion power plant. Increasing the quality and consistency of the input data is necessary to be able to derive credible information from the simulation results to support the design and decision-making process. Such computational models – especially within complex systems like fusion power plants – require validation in form of a connection to the real world. With ongoing project progress more and more credible data will be available that can be integrated in the tool to refine and validate the results. In the future the tool can be part of a digital twin where the real-world is linked to a virtual environment along the life-cycle of a fusion power plant. Coming from a pre-operational simulation tool, predicting the maintenance duration to support design decisions, the tool may support maintenance control in later operations phase, based on physical data in real time. It is discussed how the tool should be further developed as the DEMO project progresses and how it can be adapted to the requirements of the respective project phases.}

abstract = {E-commerce logistics real estate (EcLRE) is on the rise with the rapid development of logistics industry and continuous prosperity of real estate. The profit model for EcLRE is moving towards offering professional logistics services instead of simple real estate leasing. As the attributes for real estate are definite and difficult to change, the improvement of logistics service becomes necessity for EcLRE service providers to gain competitiveness in the market. However, the heterogeneous requirements from different service demanders place great challenges for the EcLRE service providers. The most puzzled one is to prevent fragmentation of logistics resources to serve different demanders (customers). This phenomenon of resource fragmentation is aggravated by the implementation of demanders’ (customers’) own information technologies or management requirements. To achieve the central management of logistics resources to serve heterogeneous demanders becomes an imperative requirement for EcLRE service provider. Therefore, this paper proposed a blockchain-enabled workflow operating system (Bc-WfOS) to centrally share heterogeneous logistics resources with different customers. Three key innovative technologies are involved to empower Bc-WfOS. The first one is gateway technology introduced to realize the UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) management of heterogeneous logistics resources. Secondly, to effectively and efficiently coordinate logistics resources, a multi-dimensional workflow model is proposed with corresponding workflow operation mechanism to suit different business logic. Additionally, a resource blockchain is designed with the integration of blockchain technology with agent technology to guarantee the data reliability to provide accurate front-line resource execution data for different customers to conduct higher decision-makings. Aiming at verifying the proposed Bc-WfOS, a prototype system is also developed and implemented in laboratory environment for conducting experimental case studies based on a real-life case.}

Reverse logistics based on the concept of “sustainable development and circular economy” has gained public attention, including the recycling and reuse of recyclable wastes. In order to explore the impact of recyclable wastes transportation on cost, environment and resources, this paper focuses on a vehicle routing problem considering electric heterogeneous fleet for a two-echelon recycling network, recycling stations and recycling centers. With the goal of minimizing the total cost, a recycling heterogeneous fleet electric vehicle routing model with time windows is established under the consideration of vehicle load constraints, vehicle type constraints on the weight of loaded recyclable wastes and customer's allowable service time constraints. For carbon emissions reduction and environment protection, vehicles used in recycling stations are designated as electric vehicles. Then, a hybrid genetic algorithm with a large-scale neighborhood search algorithm is proposed. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted on vehicle types in recycling stations, and the computational results show the use of heterogeneous fleets could reduce costs. By analyzing the relationship between customer service time and total cost, the best service time rule could be obtained in the case of customer satisfaction. Meanwhile, by analyzing the relationship between the number and the loading capacity of electric vehicles in recycling stations and total cost, the best number and the loading capacity of electric vehicles could be obtained. This heterogeneous fleet recyclables collection routing model can greatly support the construction of recycling centers and the planning of recycling tasks, and provide a basis for recycling companies to deal with the relationship between economy, environment and resources.}

abstract = {Today, due to increased market competition, the integration of production and distribution decisions into the supply chain leads to efficiency improvements. Therefore, production routing models have been developed to optimize production and distribution, simultaneously. In recent years, since, the product life cycle has become shorter than in the past, product return policies with fast response times, emphasis on return management, deformation and restorage of finished goods have become very significant. In this paper, the multi-product production routing problem with startup costs and environmental considerations has been studied. Furthermore, reverse logistics and remanufacturing decisions have been integrated. After modeling the problem as mixed-integer linear programming, due to its NP-hardness and the successful application of the Lagrangian Relaxation algorithm (LR) in solving complex supply chain problems, this algorithm has been chosen as the solution method. After applying the standard LR algorithm and the improved LR algorithm that its subgradient optimization method was modified, as a heuristic algorithm, the feasiblizer algorithm is also proposed for feasibilization of the solution obtained from the LR algorithms. To validate the model and solution method, firstly, test problems are solved by GAMS, and then the proposed algorithm is applied to test problems. The numerical results show the good performance of the LR algorithm in medium-size test problems. Finally, based on the computational experiments, managerial insights on the problem have been provided.}

This paper proposes a fully integrated logistics network that allows blood regional units, hospitals, and temporary emergency shelters to share multi-type platelets in both horizontal and vertical manner. This model not only allocates multi-type platelets to patients according to ABO/Rh(d)-compatible blood substitutions but also considers a three-layer logistics network for platelets that accounts for the impact of the age of the platelets on the suitability for different types of injuries. To efficiently solve the model and generate a Pareto front for large-scale instances of the problem, and multiple scenarios, we employ Lagrangian relaxation and the augmented ε-constraint method. Finally, to evaluate the performance of the proposed solution approach and derive practical insights, we apply it to a case study based on data about a possible earthquake in Tehran, Iran, and conduct some sensitivity analysis.}

Witnessing a substantial increase in the number of infections in Germany, the authorities have imposed drastic restrictions on everyday life. Resulting panic buying and increasing home consumption had versatile impacts on transport volume and freight capacity dynamics in German food retail logistics. Due to the lack of prior research on the effects of COVID-19 on transport volume in retail logistics, as well as resulting implications, this article aspires to shed light on the phenomenon of changing volume and capacity dynamics in road haulage. After analyzing the transport volume of n = 15,715 routes in the timeframe of 23.03.2020 to 30.04.2020, a transport volume growth rate expressing the difference of real and expected transport volume was calculated. This ratio was then examined concerning the number of COVID-19 infections per day. The results of this study prove that the increasing freight volume for dry products in retail logistics does not depend on the duration of the COVID-19 epidemy but on the strength quantified through the total number of new infections per day. This causes a conflict of interest between transportation companies and food retail logistics for non-cooled transport capacity. The contributions of this paper are highly relevant to assess the impact of a possibly occurring second COVID-19 virus infection wave.}

abstract = {When a disaster strikes, it is important to allocate limited disaster relief resources to those in need. This paper considers the allocation of resources in humanitarian logistics using three critical performance indicators: efficiency, effectiveness and equity. Three separate costs are considered to represent these metrics, namely, the accessibility-based delivery cost, the starting state-based deprivation cost, and the terminal penalty cost. A mixed-integer nonlinear programming model with multiple objectives and multiple periods is proposed. A Q-learning algorithm, a type of reinforcement learning method, is developed to address the complex optimization problem. The principles of the proposed algorithm, including the learning agent and its actions, the environment and its states, and reward functions, are presented in detail. The parameter settings of the proposed algorithm are also discussed in the experimental section. In addition, the solution quality of the proposed algorithm is compared with that of the exact dynamic programming method and a heuristic algorithm. The experimental results show that the efficiency of the algorithm is better than that of the dynamic programming method and the accuracy of the algorithm is higher than that of the heuristic algorithm. Moreover, the Q-learning algorithm provides close to or even optimal solutions to the resource allocation problem by adjusting the value of the training episode K in practical applications.}

abstract = {When a disaster strikes an area, often international assistance is requested to help responding to and recovering from the disaster. The response is often characterized by the dispatch of relief items to the affected regions via depots from Humanitarian Logistics Service Providers (HLSPs). One of the challenges an HLSP faces is how to organize its network of depots. Important questions are how many depots should be opened and what should their locations be? We develop a method that uses historical data to determine depot locations that minimize the cost of transportation and minimize the maximum response time to a disaster. We examine the trade-off between the two objectives using the Pareto front. Furthermore, we use robust optimization to find solutions that are robust against uncertainty in the location and scale of future disasters. We provide a case study of the United Nations Humanitarian Response Depot (UNHRD), a large globally operating HLSP. Among other things, we compute potential cost savings that could be obtained when expanding the network with additional depots. Also, we show the need for using robust optimization when looking for solutions that are robust against the location and scale of future disasters. We generalize the approach by applying it to the independent disaster database EM-DAT, in which we focus on examining the added value of using a robust optimization framework. The first result holds for all Uncapacitated Facility Location Problems (UFLP) with uncertain demand, which are used to find the optimal number of depots. We conclude that incorporating the likely advantage of larger networks having less uncertainty in the expected cost of transportation, enhances the decision-making regarding the optimal number of depots. Even if at some point increasing the number of depots allowed to be opened may not decrease the expected cost of transportation significantly, it is likely to reduce the uncertainty in this expected cost of transportation. For the second result, we consider UFLP used for finding optimal locations of a given number of depots. We conclude that solutions based on nominal and robust optimization may perform similar on individual years that are not included in the optimization, but robust solutions guarantee a smaller cost of transportation for worst case scenarios. This uncertainty reduction is especially valuable when the solution has to be robust against extreme scenarios.}

The objective is either to reduce the largest inventory level needed in the ILP, or to smooth the weekly workload. We develop a solution methodology that allows the handling of complex loading constraints related to dimensions and weight of the products. We model the problem as a mixed integer linear program and we develop a decomposition heuristic to solve it. We perform extensive computation tests on real instances provided by ECM. Compared with current industrial practices, our solutions yield an average improvement of 46.8% for the inventory reduction and of 25.8% for the smoothing of the workload. Our results highlight the benefit of jointly optimizing container loading and operations scheduling.}

CPS, one of Industry 4.0's key technologies, can be applied in many areas including health, mobility, production and logistics. The partial or total incorporation of CPS technologies into internal logistics equipment can present such advantages to businesses as reductions in logistics operational costs and in production cycle times. Although this application is still under development, several manufacturers already offer to the market internal logistics equipment incorporating CPS technologies, presenting them as fully capable of operating in the Industry 4.0 environment. However, it is observed that there is no effective method of assessing whether these devices effectively integrate such technologies and at what level this integration occurs. This manuscript adopted the design science research methodology to propose a method for assessing the adherence of internal logistics equipment to the CPS concept for Industry 4.0. The method is based on a guide for collecting data with questions that identify information about the CPS technologies embedded in the internal logistics equipment, associated with a tool for processing this information. The tool is supported by a properly trained artificial neural network that measures the equipment's adherence to the CPS concept. The method has proved to be adequate because in its application it assessed fifteen equipment, from worldwide-renowned manufacturers, with an error of less than 2%.}

To do so, we use a multi-period, mixed integer linear programming model to determine the optimal design for such systems. Our model prescribes strategic decisions pertaining to locations and sizes of storage facilities (called satellite storage locations, SSLs), the number of equipment sets to purchase, and allocation of farms to each SSL, as well as tactical decisions including period-to-period biomass transportation flows and period-to-period biomass inventory plans. We have studied a wide spectrum of options pertaining to harvest, preprocessing, and transportation including regular delivery and a hybrid of just-in-time and regular deliveries. Our model is applied to a potential region for biorefinery construction. Based on our analysis, when the biomass yield and equipment rate are deterministic, the most cost-effective S-BFLS consists of forage-chop for harvesting, bunkers or bags for ensiling, and a hybrid delivery system for biomass. However, when they are stochastic, non-ensiling options are quite competitive, generally better than an ensiling option except for ensiling using bunkers when the biomass yield is low. Ensiling by modules, in general, is not found to be as cost-effective as that by bags or bunkers because of the occurrence of high equipment ownership cost and operating cost. Compression of biomass for juice extraction is also not found to be cost-effective. Forage-chop harvest and whole-stalk harvest have little difference in economic effectiveness. A hybrid system for biomass delivery is recommended since it reduces logistics cost for all the configurations.}

Every year, civil construction generates a large volume of waste that can be recovered through reverse logistics. The performance evaluation of these activities is necessary for managers to know the real efficiency and effectiveness of their actions and to avoid unnecessary expenses and losses. However, this activity is still not widely practiced in developing countries, such as Brazil and Colombia. This research aims to propose a model for the evaluation of LR performance in civil construction to assist the practice of return activities in developing countries. Initially, a bibliographic search was performed to find indicators for the model. The reverse flow in the civil construction was mapped based on works published in Brazil and Colombia. From this mapping, a 12 indicators model was elaborated to approach supply logistics, internal logistics operations, and the waste management of the construction companies, in order to evaluate the performance of this sector. Also, these indicators were prioritized through the AHP method. With this prioritization, it is possible to know which indicator deserves greater attention from managers when implementing improvements. As a way to demonstrate applicability, the model was applied in a Brazilian company and other Colombian companies. It was noticeable that the Brazilian company does not have much control of its operations because it was not possible to calculate five indicators of the model due to lack of information, whereas in the Colombian company, only one indicator was not calculated due to lack of information. When analyzing the results obtained, the model provides useful data for the managers when demonstrating where the company is reaching its goals and where improvements in the process are necessary. Both companies have improving their performance in the green purchasing indicator as a priority. Both sets targets that were not met for this indicator, and according to the prioritization made by AHP, this is the point that deserves special attention from both companies. Improvement points deserve special attention from both companies. Therefore they were highlighted for each one of them and also for the model so that it could be applied in other organizations in the sector.}

Our research addresses this gap by providing a nuanced view of knowledge stocks as relationship-specific resources in service outsourcing. This research is based on a multiple case study of ten logistics outsourcing dyads. The findings build on the Relational View of Dyer and Singh (1998) and extend the understanding of how different types of relationship-specific-knowledge stocks and their sub-dimensions affect proactive and reactive RSIs. In this respect, supplier knowledge of the specific value-creating processes (e.g., logistics processes) at the buyer form the foundational layer for RSIs, flowed by a second layer of supplier knowledge of the buyer company and its up- and downstream interconnections with the customers and other suppliers. The third knowledge-layer is formed by more generic relationships-related market knowledge. In addition, the buyer’s knowledge of the service supplier showed vital in facilitating RSIs by removing barriers that hamper the supplier’s improvement efforts.}

We first determine the minimum number of robots needed to transport a set of homogeneous loads from point A to point B over a determined time interval. For the same number of robots, many assignments exist. We determine the assignment that minimizes the makespan, which is also the one which balances the loads between robots. If we consider an infinity of pickup stations, we obtain a simple analytical expression to find the optimal number of robots. With a single pickup station, we present a simple algorithm that computes the optimal fleet size. Finally, we show that the extension with heterogeneous loads can be formulated as a bin packing problem.}

abstract = {The increasing demands for customized products have brought a lot of inevitable operational dynamics to the production logistics system. How to systematically monitor and evaluate its overall real-time operation status, and to invoke the most appropriate decision-making level, use the most economical computational resource, and conduct a synchronized decision-making and control to the most accurate operation scope to address a randomly occurred dynamics has remained a long-term challenge for researchers. This paper proposes a multi-level cloud computing enabled digital twin system for the real-time monitor, decision and control of a synchronized production logistics system. In the IoT-driven production logistics synchronization (PLS) system with complete real-time information, the dynamics that occurred in the physical layer could be accurately and real-timely captured and its negative effects on the system’s overall operation state could be effectively evaluated in the digital layer. For slight, moderate and severe dynamics, edge computing, fog computing and cloud computing and their dynamically formed multi-level distributed decision-making system will be used to deal with the dynamics in the most effective and economical mode. Finally, the PLS optimization model of production and storage is presented with an industrial case, and the effectiveness is also demonstrated and analyzed.}

All sectors of society, including the government, have begun to focus on energy issues. How to realize an ideal supply-demand matching of logistics resources is one of the common issues and objectives. To facilitate the development of this platform for both academic researchers and industrial practitioners, a green urban closed-loop logistics distribution network model is proposed in this paper by using the supply and demand data of a logistics service consumer to obtain the optimized solution that minimizes the emissions of greenhouse gases and the overall operational cost. This study aims to assist enterprises to effectively reduce carbon emissions in the current logistics distribution process. This paper uses a case study to validate the feasibility and practicality of the proposed green logistics distribution model to help end-users optimize their daily operations. The results show that there is a negative correlation between the cost and carbon emissions under the shortest distribution routes. However, this negative correlation is not absolute, for instance, certain changes in distribution cost may lead to positive correlation between the cost and carbon emissions. The multi-objective Pareto optimization results also show that the combination of vehicles, including electric vehicles and fuel vehicles, is able to effectively achieve a win-win scenario including carbon emissions and distribution costs, which could be ideal for enterprises. Furthermore, the proposed model could also provide guiding significance for enterprises to achieve low carbon distribution and for governments to promote a low carbon agenda in the urban logistics network distribution system.}

To this end, a decision framework is proposed based on a multi-criteria decision structure that incorporates AHP into VIKOR under Intuitionistic Fuzzy Theory. This integration presents different solutions and rankings based on different decision-making strategies and also captures uncertainty in the evaluation process. While Intuitionistic Fuzzy AHP calculates the importance weights of the proposed criteria indicated as scalability, privacy, interoperability, audit, latency, visibility, trust, and security, Fuzzy VIKOR ranks the logistics operations demonstrated as materials handling, warehousing, order processing, transportation, packaging, fleet management, labeling, vehicle routing and product returns management. The proposed decision framework was applied in a large-scale logistics company located in Turkey. The findings of this study suggest that while the most important criteria are security, visibility and audit, the most feasible logistics operations proved to be transportation, materials handling, warehousing, order processing and fleet management in a possible blockchain implementation. The decision framework in this study may enable decision makers to evaluate the feasibility of blockchain in logistics operations, which is one of the main research gaps in the current blockchain research.

As a hypothesis, it is assumed that there is a relationship between the LPI and selected factors in GCI, which were grouped into three clusters: infrastructure, human factor, and institutions. The purpose is to investigate which of those groups has the most significant impact on the LPI - an interactive comparative analysis tool created by the World Bank that addresses logistics issues in a broad context against world regions' development or countries' economies. For this purpose, the LPI was used as the dependent variable, while a linear regression model measured some GCI components' influence. The study was conducted for Africa, Asia, and the EU, employing the ANOVA method. The paper finds the three clusters are related to higher efficiency. While the new method shows these clusters are essential for improving the logistics performance index, an extensive range of factors might affect logistics sector performance in both geography and stage of development. In Europe, human factor is far more critical for progressively improving the LPI, while necessary infrastructure remains crucial in Asia. All three factors are central to Africa's logistics development.}

Recently, Amazon and Walmart along with other major companies have started offering same-day delivery. That translates into not using full truckload capacities, requiring more frequent dispatch, and in turn, increases transportation cost. However, inefficient routes are not only more expensive for the shipper but they are also more carbon-intensive. In this context, and from an operative level, we analyze the environmental impact of inbound logistics caused by fast shipping. We create a discrete-event simulation model to understand and compare the effect that certain parameters (i.e., delivery windows, inventory management policies, truck type) have on sustainability inbound logistics. We validate this model with the largest retailer in Mexico in order to analyze how sustainable fast shipping actually is and how to reduce its environmental impact. Results from the simulation model show that fast shipping produces significantly higher CO2 emissions since it imposes a challenge for cargo consolidation. We found that fast-shipping increases both total CO2 emissions and costs up to 15% and 68%, respectively.}

Our findings suggest that firms in LSS cities hold less cash than those in non-LSS cities. Most important, these LSS firms have a higher market value of cash holdings than non-LSS firms. The findings are robust to alternative metrics of cash holding and different subsamples. Furthermore, we use a propensity score matching approach to mitigate potential endogeneity, run placebo tests and conduct Heckman two-stage analysis. Additional analyses suggest the following: (1) the impact of LSS reform on cash holdings lasts at least 2 years, (2) LSS firms experience better cash management efficiency than non-LSS firms, (3) the impact of LSS reform is more pronounced for state-owned firms (SOEs) than non-SOEs, and (4) LSS firms experience better corporate investment efficiency in terms of less overinvestment.}

This paper proposes an integrated approach combing system dynamics and agent-based modeling to evaluate the long-term development and operating status of a city-wide ULS project. The project boundaries regarding underground network expansion, stakeholders’ attributes, and social-environmental benefit metrics were structured as eight highly-interacted agent modules. Critical decision variables of agents in terms of supply-demand equilibrium, investment plan, pricing-to-market and willingness-to-pay were incorporated into three formulized subsystem models. From empirical perspective, the urban territory of Beijing, China, was taken as a case to simulate the development footprints of ULS project under different funding options and market acceptance degrees. Results show that ULS has significant competence with respect to service capacity and profitability, while enabling billions of dollars of external cost-saving annually. Moreover, the comprehensive performance of ULS project regarding economic incomes, benefits, market demand, and construction schedule can reach satisfactory tradeoffs through adaptively adjusting the funding policies, incentives and pricing portfolios during project development.}

abstract = {In harsh environments, offshore oil and gas support operations are subjected to frequent logistics and supply chain operational disruption, due to harsh environmental factors with their associated risks. To capture these stochastic influential factors and support related decision making, it is helpful to develop a robust and dynamic probabilistic model. The current study presents a proactive methodology that integrates the Pure-Birth Markovian process (PBMP) with the Bayesian network (BN) for the effective analysis of offshore logistics disruption risk. The PBMP captures the stochasticity in the failure characteristics of the engineering systems for estimating the time-evolution degradation probability. The BN explores the dynamic interactions among the most important offshore logistics influential factors to analyze the disruption risk in a harsh environment. The effects of influential factors’ non-linear dependencies are propagated and updated, given evidence on the degree of disruption. The level of logistics disruption is further assessed using cost aggregation-based expectation theory. The theory explores the incurred cost/economic risk under different operational scenarios. The proposed methodology is tested on an offshore supply vessel operation to estimate the likely operational disruption risk in terms of financial loss in a harsh operating environment. The most critical influential functions are assessed to establish their degree of impact on the logistics disruption. At the upper bound probability of disruption occurrence, an economic risk/additional incurred cost of US$2.38E+05 with a variance (σ2) of 3.05×109 was predicted. The result obtained suggests that the proposed methodology is adaptive and effective for dynamic logistics disruption risk analysis in harsh offshore environments.}

Last-mile fulfilment is among the most energy consuming logistics operations in the supply chain because of the vast amount of stops and low fill rates. The study's purpose is to explore last-mile fulfilment options in regard to their energy efficiency and to develop guiding propositions for energy efficient last-mile fulfilment options.
Design/methodology/approach
Interviews with Swedish retailers and their logistics service providers (LSPs) were conducted to compare different last-mile fulfilment options for consumer goods. Data of these options in respect to energy efficiency was analysed in regard to a framework with the components of distribution structure, transportation execution, and household logistics capability.
Findings
This study analysed the energy efficiency of six distinct options in the last-mile fulfilment. Since transportation in the last mile is highly energy consuming, energy could be saved in last-mile fulfilment when goods are carried as far as possible collectively down in the supply chain to collection points close to the point of consumption (POC) in commercial vehicles with high fill rates. The end consumer should be responsible for only the last part of the last mile. Proximity between private households and collection points increases the possibility that the consumer will walk or use public transportation.
Practical implications
This study provides insights to managers of logistics companies and retailers regarding how to save energy in last-mile logistics fulfilment.
Originality/value
Viewing consumers as co-producers of logistics solutions and aligning the distribution structure, transportation execution, and household logistics capability suggest propositions for the improved energy efficiency of last-mile fulfilment options in the supply chain.}

This study tackles a collaborative multi-center vehicle routing problem with resource sharing and temperature control constraints (CMCVRP-RSTC). Solving the CMCVRP-RSTC by minimizing the total cost and the number of refrigerated vehicles returns a fresh logistics operational strategy that pinpoints how a multi-center fresh logistics distribution network can be reorganized to highlight potential collaboration opportunities. To find the solution to the CMCVRP-RSTC, we develop a hybrid heuristic algorithm that combines the extended k-means clustering and tabu search non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (TS-NSGA-II) to search a large solution space. This hybrid heuristic algorithm ensures that the optimal solution is found efficiently through initial solution filtering and the combination of local and global searches. Furthermore, we explore how to motivate individual LPs to collaborate by analyzing the benefits of collaboration to each LP. Using the minimum costs remaining savings method and the strictly monotonic path rule, a cost saving calculation model is proposed to find the best profit allocation scheme where each collaborating LP keeps benefiting from long-term collaboration. An empirical case study of Chongqing City, China indicates the efficiency of our proposed collaborative mechanism and optimization algorithms. Our study will help improve the efficiency of logistics operation significantly and contribute to the development of more intelligent logistics systems and smart cities.}

abstract = {On-demand logistics platform has been developed rapidly to respond increasingly customized demands. Many platform-based enterprises are facing difficulties in operating that resulting in inefficient resource allocation, high costs and top-down centralized decision-making process so that unsustainable on-demand delivery is an existing challenge. Such a platform service supply chain is highly influenced by fluctuating supply and demand. To solve this problem, this paper introduces an online double auction for on-demand pickup and delivery in the metropolitan cities, allowing both shippers and carriers dynamically enter and exit transactions. A multi-agent environment is created to automate the real-time auctioning through cyber-physical-system technologies. The proposed method aims at maximizing the social welfare and minimizing trade failures in the face of uncertainty of future agent types or the information of further bids and asks. The approach is extending the well-known McAfee's single-unit method, to allocate multi-unit on-demand logistics tasks using public, private, robot-enabled delivery capacities. It is observed that truthful bidding is a dominant strategy for each agent under this mechanism while realizing budget balance and individual rationality. The results show that the designed auction is more suitable to employ if supply-demand unbalance exists, compared with the fixed pricing mechanism. It suggests using more crowdsourcing resources rather than private carriers to improve transaction efficiency and transportation sustainability.}

To this end, it carried out a case study on a cell phone refurbishment company that is responsible for the reconditioning of cell phones; the company also receives returned cell phones from one of the largest cell phone manufacturers in Brazil. Another company collects waste from the refurbishing process and recycles the precious metals and plastic from the electronic electronics components. A number of propositions were made and confirmed through an interview conducted with the owner of the refurbishment company. It is concluded that the main reasons for the return of the product are the “buy back” process, irreparable and at the end of life cell phones. And from cell phones received from the manufacturer, it is estimated that about 15% of the products are returned to the market without remanufacturing, 15% are used for the salvaged components, and 70% are reconditioned for return to the market. The refurbishing process proved to be profitable because the annual cash flow approached USD 2.5 million and generated a profit of USD 226 thousand for the refurbishment company and prevents a discard of 4.5 tons/year of EEW, which gives an efficiency of 88% of all the cell phone manufactured by the company. Thus, the reverse logistics chain of the cellular manufacturing industry in Brazil has proved to be very sustainable, with zero net EEW.}

Under QR systems, in the digital data analytics era, the fashion brand can acquire market information using digital technologies to improve demand forecasting. This enhances the respective ordering and transportation mode selection decisions. It is known that to implement QR systems requires the availability of the right logistics option (e.g., transportation mode) and the needed logistics capacity in the future. An Internet based elastic logistics platform (ELP) hence emerges to help. In this paper, in the main model, we analytically derive via stochastic dynamic programming the optimal transportation option selection and inventory ordering policy with the ELP. We further examine the value of ELP and identify the situations in which it is especially beneficial to adopt it. Robustness checking is conducted which proves that the theoretical findings derived in the main model are solid. Specific managerial action plans and managerial implications are developed.}

Results show that offering logistics service by the retailer is not always the optimal choice although it alleviates the double marginalization effect. Regarding the value of cost-sharing contracts in such a supply chain, we find that a variable cost sharing contract benefits the retailer but hurts the logistics service provider. When a part of fixed cost is shared by the retailer, a win–win outcome will be achieved.}

Unlike previous works aimed at investigating logistics productivity, this paper focuses on the main variables affecting Total Factor Productivity (TFP) in the transport and logistics sectors. The findings of this study contribute to filling the gap in transport related literature on the issue of ‘Total Factor Regional Logistics Productivity’ (TFRLP), identifying the most important elements able to improve the TFP level using an econometric estimate. In a second step, we carry out a comparison among the different Italian regions with a view to testing the relationship between the logistics and economic activities of a territory. The results of this latter analysis show that, in the different Italian regions, the logistics sector is characterised by a high resilience capacity, so innovation in the logistics industry is a strong element in driving regional exports.}

abstract = {The logistics sprawl – warehousing and distribution centers relocating farther away from central urban areas to the urban periphery – has been widely examined in multiple global trade gateways. The spatial shifts have been attributed to the systematic and geographic restructuring of goods production and distribution systems at the global scale. More recently, growing online shopping sales and demand for instant delivery have put tremendous pressure on online retail businesses to locate order fulfillment centers in urban areas with direct access to the consumer markets. Has the trend of sprawling warehouses reversed? Have warehouses been relocating closer to consumer demand? In this research, I use a relative distribution measure to quantify the spatial distribution of warehouses relative to the logistics sector, the goods movement sector, and the general population over time. The main data source is ZIP Code Business Patterns from 2003 to 2016 with the study area of the 64 largest US metropolitan areas. In 2016, warehouses were most closely distributed relative to logistics sectors (38.6 km), followed by goods movement sectors (41.2 km), and population (43.5 km). From 2003 to 2016, the distance between warehouses and related businesses has increased, but the extent varies with respect to metropolitan and warehouse size. The trend of increasing relative distance from warehouses to related businesses stopped since the economic recession in 2008. Relative distribution measures are significantly correlated with internal ground shipment ton-kilometers but only in large trade gateways.}

abstract = {The use of electric vehicles (EVs) is becoming more and more widespread and the interest in these vehicles is increasing each day. EVs promise to emit less air pollution and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions with lower operational costs when compared to fossil fuel-powered vehicles. However, many factors such as the limited mileage of these vehicles, long recharging times, and the sparseness of available recharging stations adversely affect the preferability of EVs in industrial and commercial logistics. Effective planning of EV routes and recharge schedules is vital for the future of the logistics sector. This paper proposes an electric vehicle routing problem with the time windows (EVRPTW) framework, which is an extension of the well-known vehicle routing problem (VRP). In the proposed model, partial recharging is considered for the EVRPTW with the multiple depots and heterogeneous EV fleet and multiple visits to customers. While routing a set of heterogeneous EVs, their limited ranges, interdependent on the battery capacity, should be taken into consideration and all the customers' deliveries should be completed within the predetermined time windows. To deal with this problem, a series of neighbourhood operators are developed for the local search process in the variable neighbourhood search (VNS) and variable neighbourhood descent (VND) heuristics. The proposed solution algorithms are tested in large-scale instances. Results indicate that the proposed heuristics perform well as to this problem in terms of optimizing recharging times, idle waiting times, overtime of operators, compliance with time windows, number of vehicles, depots, and charging stations used.}

Consequently, manufacturers must develop EoL management of EVs-LIBs through reverse logistics (RLs) activities, which are bounded with many implementation barriers. Although several studies have been accomplished for RLs barrier analysis in various industries, less attention has been devoted to identifying and systematically analysing barriers of EVs-LIBs RLs. The purpose of this study is to identify a comprehensive list of the main barriers to the successful implementation of EVs-LIBs RLs practices. Based on the inputs from European industrial experts, an integrated approach of Total Interpretive Structural Modelling (TISM) and Cross-Impact Matrix Multiplication Applied to Classification (MICMAC) was applied to develop a hierarchical model based on the defined barrier categories. Finally, the most dominant barrier categories to the successful implementation of RLs activities for EVs-LIBs were prioritised to provide insights to industrial decision-makers and policymakers. Data were gathered using a questionnaire survey, which was distributed to various experts in EVs-LIBs manufacturing/recycling and EVs manufacturing companies. The findings revealed that ‘market and social’, and ‘policy and regulations’ categories are the two most influencing barriers to the implementation of EVs-LIBs RLs. This study lays the foundation for future research on the RLs activities for EVs-LIBs in a time that EU regulations on the circular economy are mandating all auto manufacturing companies to deal with their EoL wastes.}

The importance of service-oriented design for SC and logistics systems has been stressed, especially with regards to interoperability and sustainability. In this context, the recent intelligent interoperable logistics paradigm has been increasingly studied and the Smart Product-Service System (PSS) concept seems interesting for the paradigm. Smart PSS are characterised by their ability to collect and process information autonomously and subsequently make decisions and self-act/evolve. Interested in the potential for tackling complex logistics systems, this paper investigates how smart PSS could be considered and designed for service-oriented, intelligent interoperable logistics. A recent breakthrough logistics paradigm called the Physical Internet (PI) is taken as a practical example in this research. We present and discuss key design issues and innovative business models associated with smart PSS in PI. The results clearly indicate the promising potential of smart PSS in PI and the need for further research. Consequently, new research avenues leading to a new era of intelligent interoperable logistics are outlined. This paper intends to contribute to two main areas of research: the design and implementation of smart PSS in PI, and functional and conceptual research on PI and intelligent interoperable logistics.}

Finally, the multivariate analysis is subsequently employed to analyze data obtained from surveys by structural equation modeling (SEM) technique. Findings indicate that port logistics service quality is positively determined by five factors including responsiveness, assurance, reliability, tangibles and empathy. In addition, port logistics service quality exerts positive influence on customer satisfaction. Most noticeably, as embedded in the tangibles component, technological advancements appear to enhance service quality which ultimately satisfies customers in the port logistics service industry.}

As a response to the growing dysfunctions of the global LNs due to the detrimental effects of the black swan events, this article develops a quantitative vulnerability assessment method by paying simultaneous attention to various structural properties of these networks. It adopts three prototypical examples of centrality indices known as betweenness, closeness, and eigenvector centrality. This work also develops a vulnerability index from the joint entropy of centrality values, which can be interpreted as a certain extent of risk to disruptions in supply provision in LNs. The proposed entropy-based vulnerability index enables a far more accurate analysis of vulnerability by measuring the degree of homogeneity and heterogeneity of centrality values. The suggested index is considered as an objective function that must be minimized to reduce the deleterious effects of the black swan events. To illustrate the proposed vulnerability assessment method, this paper analyzes a real-world global maritime network, concluding that the juxtaposition of centrality measures provides a richer insight into the vulnerability analysis of LNs. The results also favor the fact that increasing the homogeneity of a network through decentralization yields lower vulnerability and builds extra robustness into the networks.}

abstract = {This paper investigates an interesting regional multimodal logistics network design problem with CO2 emission reduction target and uncertain demands in the context of urban cluster development. From the perspective of system optimization, a regional logistics network involves a centralized logistics authority and a centralized carrier, where the logistics authority concerns the regional logistics network configuration in terms of the number, location and scale of logistics parks and the subsidies of rail transportation links, and the carrier’s decisions include the choice of transportation route for each logistics demand. Given a determined logistics demand pattern, this multi-stakeholder decision making problem is first formulated as a bi-level programming model followed by its equivalent mathematical programming with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) to depict the leader-follower behaviors. To capture the risk aversion level of the logistics authority in uncertain demand environment, an improved adjustable robust optimization method is proposed, including an individual control parameter and providing an exact expression of the maximum satisfaction probability. Computational results and related impact analysis demonstrate that the proposed models and solution methods are effective, which can provide the beneficial theory basis and practice guide for the green and sustainable development of regional logistics.}
