abstract = {Rice is the main staple food in most of the Asian countries and rice crops generate a huge amount of rice straw as crop residue in the fields. Unsustainable use of rice straw and open burning of crop in the field not only produces threat to environment by producing large amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, but also make farmer׳s loose a very viable by-product. Rice straw can be used in bio-ethanol production and bring additional income and sustainable utilization. It will also provide clean energy solution to ever increasing energy demand in India. However, it becomes more important to study the sustainability of bio-ethanol production from rice straw and how it can make sense in today׳s Indian agricultural scenario. Although, the bioethanol obtained from rice straw is a carbon neutral in nature, but the concerns of environmental impacts have been raised for the whole process i.e. from rice cultivation, rice logistics, pretreatment techniques, bioethanol generation and transportation. The present review focuses on the environmental sustainability issues arising from use of rice straw for bioethanol production. The environmental impacts are assessed by studying the emission of greenhouse gases from each stage of life cycle. The paper presents an outlook on current status and future prospects of ethanol blending in the country.}

Earthwork, a basic operation for any type of construction, depends heavily on equipment. The productivity and safety of earthwork equipment are decided by effective management of the equipment. Therefore, fleet telematics can also improve the earthwork operation as well. The goal of this research is to develop a GPS only-based fleet telematics system for heavy earthwork equipment which can analyze time log information of each equipment using GPS location data without utilizing any other on-board sensors and CAN bus data. The earthwork site (loading and dumping area) and moving route, hazardous areas of the project are all visualized on a map via geo-fencing technology considering the characteristics of earthwork operation. Lastly, algorithms to analyze the utilization time of earthwork equipment using GPS location information are designed and their reliability are verified through field tests.}

This process involved three phases: (a) preliminary intervention development, drawing on content from a prior evidence-based intervention; (b) contextual adaptation of the curriculum through formative data collection using a multi-method qualitative approach; and (c) pre-testing of trauma screening procedures and a subsequent trial run of the intervention. Feedback from key informant interviews and patient in-depth interviews guided the refinement of session content and adaptation of key intervention elements, including culturally relevant visuals, metaphors, and interactive exercises. The trial run curriculum consisted of four individual sessions and two group sessions. Strong session attendance during the trial run supported the feasibility of ImpACT. Participants responded positively to the logistics of the intervention delivery and the majority of session content. Trial run feedback helped to further refine intervention content and delivery towards a pilot randomized clinical trial to assess the feasibility and potential efficacy of this intervention.}

abstract = {The growing economic importance of the biomass-for-bioenergy in Europe motivates research on biomass supply chain design and planning. The temporally and geographically fragmented availability of woody biomass makes it particularly relevant to find cost-effective solutions for biomass production, storage and transportation up to the consumption facility. This paper addresses tactical decisions related with optimal allocation of wood chips from forest residues at forest sites to terminals and power plants. The emphasis is on a “hot-system” with synchronized chipping and chips transportation at the roadside. Thus, decisions related with the assignment of chippers to forest sites are also considered. We extend existing studies by considering the impact of the wood chips energy content variation in the logistics planning. This is a key issue in biomass-for-bioenergy supply chains. The higher the moisture content of wood chips, the lower its net caloric value and therefore, a larger amount of chips is needed to meet the contracted demand. We propose a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model to solve this problem to optimality. Results of applying the model in a biomass supply chain case in Finland are presented. Results suggest that a 20% improvement in the supplier profit can be obtained with the proposed approach when compared with a baseline situation that relies on empirical estimates for a fixed and known moisture content in the end of an obliged storage age.}

Companies and researchers strive to find new and innovative methods to reduce greenhouse gases emissions across all the stages of their green supply chains. The previous studies generally, employed integrated models for greenhouse gases emissions management in green supply chains. These models neglected the conflict and coordination among different supply chain members. Furthermore, as important practices to make the companies more adapted for the environment, product design, supplier selection, and logistics process are seldom studied in previous research. In this paper, we consider a green supply chain with multiple suppliers, a single manufacturer and multiple retailers. A game-theoretic model is established to simultaneously investigate the impacts of the product line design, supplier selection, transportation mode selection and pricing strategies on profits and greenhouse gases emissions. Genetic algorithm is applied to obtain the solution of this model. The proposed model and generated results can provide decision makers with a better tradeoff between profit and environmental impacts.

abstract = {Background
Scalp angiosarcomas (SA) are rare, representing <1% of soft tissue sarcomas. The optimal management of these tumors is unknown, with management based on small case series. We sought to assess the impact of different therapies on overall survival (OS), the practice patterns nationally, and identify factors associated with OS for non-metastatic scalp angiosarcomas.
Methods
A prospectively maintained database was used to identify non-metastatic scalp angiosarcomas who received some form of definitive therapy. Logistics regression, Kaplan-Meier, and Cox proportional-hazard models were utilized.
Results
A total of 589 patients met study entry criteria with a median follow-up of 4.2 years. The majority (482 patients, 81.8%) had upfront definitive resection and an additional 317 patients (65.8%) received postoperative radiation. Of the 107 patients who didn't have surgery, the majority (65 patients, 60.7%) received definitive radiation and 42 patients (39.3%) received radiation and chemotherapy. One-year and five-year survival estimates for patients not receiving definitive surgery were 68.0% (95%CI: 57.5–76.4) and 18.0% (95%CI: 10.2–27.5) respectively compared to 78.2% (95%CI: 74.0–81.9) and 34.1% (95%CI: 28.9–39.3) for patients receiving definitive surgery (p < 0.01). On multivariable analysis, age ≥65 years, tumor size ≥5 cm, and not receiving definitive surgery was associated with worse OS.
Conclusions
The majority of patients with non-metastatic scalp angiosarcomas had upfront definitive surgery, with a subsequent improvement in OS, including when accounting for other patient and tumor factors. Postoperative radiation was frequently given. Our large series confirmed age and tumor size as prognostic factors for this rare disease.}

Here, we present a new lake record from lake Hakluytvatnet at Amsterdamøya island (79.5°N), the northwesternmost island on Svalbard. Multi-proxy analyses of lake sediments in combination with geomorphological mapping reveal large environmental shifts that have taken place at Amsterdamøya during the Holocene. A robust chronology has been established for the lake sediment core through 28 AMS radiocarbon ages, and this gives an exceptionally well-constrained age control for a lake at this latitude. The Holocene was a period with large changes in the Hakluytvatnet catchment, and the onset of the Neoglacial (ca. 5 ka) marks the start of modern-day conditions in the catchment. The Neoglacial is characterized by fluctuations in the minerogenic input to the lake as well as internal productivity, and we suggest that these fluctuations are driven by atmospherically forced precipitation changes as well as sea ice extent modulating the amount of moisture that can reach Hakluytvatnet.}

Small batch sizes down to a batch size of “1” lead to a high complexity in the design and economical manufacturing of these customized products. Intralogistics system are integrated into higher-level areas (segment level) as well as into upstream and downstream performance units (system-wide areas). This includes the logistic activities relevant for the system (organized according to storage, picking, transport) such as transportation or storage tasks of tools, semi-finished products, components, assemblies and containers, and waste. Today’s centralized material flow control systems, which work based on predefined processes, are not capable and more specifically not suitable to deal with the arising complexity of changeable intralogistics systems. Autonomous, decentralized material flow control systems distribute the required decision-making and control processes on intelligent logistic entities. A major step for the development of an autonomous control method for hybrid intralogistics systems (manual, semi-automated and automated) is the development of a generic archetype for intralogistics systems regarding the system boundaries, elements and relations resulting in a descriptive model taking into account amongst others the time of demand, availability of resources, economic efficiency and technical performance parameters. The ESB Logistics Learning Factory at ESB Business School (Reutlingen University) serves for this as a close-to-reality development and validation environment.}

This study employs system dynamics (SD) model to explore the effect of single strategy and combined scenarios on mitigating inventory amplification, i.e., bullwhip effect (BE) in three-echelon SC. Novel scenario simulation is designed to stimulate recovery activities of electronic waste, decrease solid material depletion and promote clean production. Main thread is as follows: establishing SD model in line with practical operation mechanism, testing the robustness of model, emulating the effect of single strategy and combined scenarios on mitigating BE and finally proposing optimal strategies on the optimization of green SC. Results show that positive recovery activities is an optimal solution in green SC among single strategies; simulated scenarios alleviate the BE largely especially the combination of higher recovery ratio and information transparency reinforcement. Initially, the emulated-mapping of this field helps graphically illustrate the potential optimized-directions and stimulate individual recovery behaviors in green SC.}

In such applications, robots must establish collaborative interactions so to achieve their individual and collective goals and a key problem is for robots to make individual decisions so to optimize a system wide objective function. This problem is typically referred to as coordination. In this paper, we first describe modern optimization techniques for coordination in multiRobot systems. Specifically, we focus on approaches that are based on algorithms widely used to solve graphical models and constraint optimization problems, such as the max-sum algorithm. We then analyze the coordination problem faced by a set of robots operating in a warehouse logistic application. In this context robots must transport items from loading to unloading bays so to complete packages to be delivered to customers. Robots must cooperate to maximize the number of packages completed in the unit of time. To this end a crucial component is to avoid interferences when moving in the environment. We show how such problem can be formalized as a Distributed Constrained Optimization problem and we provide a solution based on the binary max-sum algorithm. Finally, we provide a quantitative evaluation of our approach in a simulated scenario using standard robotics tools (ROS and Gazebo).}

Various areas of management such as purchasing, logistics and strategy have critically evaluated theories to move these fields of management forward. However, no such work exists in the area of voluntary standards. Voluntary standards, such as standards for quality, environmental management and social responsibility have been covered extensively in research studies and substantial knowledge exists in terms of their diffusion, adoption, impact and governance. The studies adopt different theoretical perspectives. A number of literature reviews on voluntary standards exist; however, none of the papers so far has critically scrutinized the theoretical underpinnings of these studies. This paper, therefore, fills an important gap in the literature by providing a critical review of theories that contribute to understanding the issues pertinent to voluntary standards. Inductive and deductive search methods are applied considering the ten most prominent voluntary standards (ISO 9001, ISO 14001, OHSAS, 18001, ISO 26000, EMAS, AA1000, SA8000, FSC, MSC, and FairTrade). Nine theories (clustered as Corporate Nature Theories, External (Stakeholder) Perspective Theories and Process and Attitude Perspective Theories) that have been previously employed are scrutinized. The paper analyses the evolution of theoretical underpinnings of 62 papers published in high ranked journals between 2001 and 2016. The analysis demonstrates a dominant use of Corporate Nature Theories and External (Stakeholder) Perspective Theories and shows the evolution of the field. The paper concludes by linking the theories to key research areas in voluntary standards and aids researchers by identifying theories that are promising in terms of their applicability to explore future research paths in this field of study.}

To synchronize the replenishment of both companies, we adopt a can-order joint replenishment policy for both companies, and we analyze how the costs of each individual company are impacted by the collaboration. We consider different agreements to redistribute the costs (or the gains) of the collaboration, ranging from no cost redistribution at all, sharing the transportation costs (or its gains) only, to sharing the total logistics costs (or its gains) that are impacted by the collaboration, i.e., transportation + inventory costs. We show that the stability (and thus the long-term viability) of the partnership strongly depends on the cost-sharing agreement, in combination with the allocation mechanism used to share the costs (or gains) of the coordination. Although most companies focus on the redistribution of transportation costs, we show that this might not lead to a stable situation where each individual company eventually benefits from collaboration.}

This paper identifies challenges surrounding domestic air freight markets in Australia and compares the provision of road vs air freight services utilising gravity modelling methods. Our findings suggest the impedance of domestic air freight services in Australia is greater for regional areas between the primary cities (such as Canberra, between Sydney and Melbourne) than remoter areas (such as Cairns in Northern Australia). Our models show further that in addition to distance, air freight capacity on any of our analysed routes is despite being demand-pulled in terms of GDP dependency significantly attuned to factors at both the origin (in particular domestic trade capability, i.e. manufacturing and logistics) and destination.}

The aim was to understand the perceptions of road safety and road traffic injuries associated with active school travel and how closely these match the real risk in terms of road traffic accidents occurring on the school commute and the benefits in terms of increased physical activity in children.
Methods
An epidemiological review and literature review of national and local data was undertaken using information regarding demography, active school travel, walk time to schools, police reported accidents, physical activity and obesity. Stakeholder views were gathered through an electronic active school travel survey and qualitative focus groups with schools in Leicestershire and Rutland. Qualitative focus group sessions took place in four schools across Leicestershire and Rutland (2 primary, 2 secondary) with a total of 13 teachers, 48 students and 21 parents taking part.
Results
A large proportion of primary school pupils in Leicestershire and Rutland potentially could travel to school actively based on walking times less than 30minutes. However this proportion is reduced for secondary schools, particularly in Rutland, where mixed mode transport may be necessary. Focus groups and an online survey of schools identified a number of barriers and enablers involved in active school travel. The main barriers included the distance, weather, attitudes, safety, and time logistics. Enablers included awareness, attitudes of staff students and pupils, logistics and facilities, travel share schemes, school travel plans and sharing good practice. Safety perceptions of children who responded to the travel survey were higher for their current mode used to get to school than other modes, which may prevent uptake. The literature review highlighted evidence for a number of effective interventions and suggests that a programme of work will be required to change school travel behaviour and increase active travel mode choice. A variety of interventions are provided currently across Leicestershire and Rutland, however awareness, capacity, access and future resources are variable and uncertain.
Conclusion and Recommendations
From the evidence reviewed and the gaps identified a number of recommendations are made. A multiagency group including transport, public health, schools and safety partners as a minimum should be convened who are responsible for developing a policy on active school travel to address the policy recommendations. There are further commissioning recommendations for schools, local authorities, CCGs and the LLR Road safety partnership to consider.}

abstract = {Food waste is a major global problem that has far-reaching implications related to energy, water and land use, greenhouse gas emissions and economic losses. The origins of food waste can be attributed, at least in part, to changing perceptions of the societal value of food, and now losses of edible food materials are observed across the entire farm-to-fork spectrum, from agriculture to food processing, distribution, and consumption. Although most waste occurs at consumer-facing businesses and households, at these stages the waste materials are relatively heterogeneous and dispersed, and thus difficult to divert to productive use. Widely promoted food recovery hierarchies place the highest value on providing excess food for human or animal consumption, but a relatively small fraction of the total waste volume is suitable for these uses. Waste-to-energy conversion methods, including anaerobic digestion, fermentation, transesterification, bioelectrochemical systems, gasification and pyrolysis, and hydrothermal liquefaction, may provide viable alternatives, but their environmental and economic performance must be rigorously evaluated at a system level. The optimal pathway is also dependent on the existing policy and regulatory framework, as well as factors that influence system deployment, such as waste feedstock transport and energy distribution logistics.}

The paper is organized in two main parts to investigate the basic features of these studies. In the first part, planning decisions, network structure, paradigms and aspects related to SCM are discussed. In the second part, existing optimization techniques for dealing with uncertainty such as recourse-based stochastic programming, risk-averse stochastic programming, robust optimization, and fuzzy mathematical programming are explored in terms of mathematical modeling and solution approaches.

abstract = {Background
The professional need for development of clinical faculty is clear. Previous scholarship provides insight into the formative potential of peer review in both didactic and experiential settings. Less information exists on a comprehensive peer review process (PRP) designed to support faculty change.
Educational activity and setting
A clinical faculty PRP was developed and implemented based on input from the literature, stakeholders, and field experts. The process included: 1) self-reflective pre-work, 2) a peer-observation component, 3) self-reflective post-work, and 4) creation of a specific action plan via meeting with an educational expert. The process was assessed by collecting evaluative data from peer reviewer and clinical faculty participants.
Findings
Eight of 26 faculty members participated in a pilot of the PRP and formed four clinical faculty-peer dyads. When surveyed, all participants unanimously reported that they would participate in the PRP again. Aspects perceived among most helpful to clinical teaching included peer observation, self-reflection, and meeting with an educational expert. Challenges related to the process included anxiety of peer observation, burden of pre-work, and logistics of scheduling meetings.
Discussion
While instruments are important in guiding and documenting the evaluation of clinical teaching during an observation period, this initiative focused on the process supporting the observation and evaluation, in order to optimize the formative feedback received by participating faculty and encourage professional development actions.
Summary
A PRP that incorporates preparation, reflective practice, and a meeting with an educational expert may support meaningful faculty development in the area of clinical teaching.}

Crambe oil contains erucic acid, giving it economic importance for use in the electricity sector. Crambe oil can be used in insulating fluids and in the manufacture of chemical products and biodiesel without competing with human food production. As it is a new crop in Brazil, the scientific literature on crambe is still scarce. This review discusses general aspects of agricultural production and the potential applications of crambe associated mainly with the manufacture of biodiesel. The topics discussed in this review include: (i) genetic improvement of crambe; (ii) agronomic practices of production, pests, diseases, harvesting, storage, and economic viability; (iii) industrial use of crambe oil as an electrical insulator and in biodiesel; (iv) detoxification of the co-product generated during oil extraction for use in animal feed and use of the co-product in the natural bioremediation of contaminants; and (v) the challenges of increasing crambe production. Crambe has a remarkable future as a source of renewable energy in Brazil. Strategies to boost its cultivation, such as the identification of improved varieties and optimization of production system logistics, marketing, and resource allocation, should be adopted.}

Questionnaire surveys and thermal environmental parameter measurements were taken simultaneously. Logistics multiple regression models were established for winter and summer conditions, and influences of individual factors on thermal satisfaction of the elderly in free running environments were analyzed. Results indicated that the factors affecting the thermal satisfaction of the elderly had distinct seasonal differences. ‘Satisfaction on wind environment’ influenced elderly thermal satisfaction both in winter and summer season. In addition, the influencing factors of the thermal satisfaction also included: “time indoors”, “influence of sickness” in winter season and “sleeping regularly” in summer season.

Fruit and vegetable processing industries account for the largest segment of food waste which is produced worldwide. The disposal of this waste requires a huge capital investment, majority of which is the transportation costs. This results in dumping and burning of these wastes in open fields.
Scope and approach
In this review, we have focussed on the valorisation schemes to extract valuable biomolecules from pineapple on-farm and processing waste for food and therapeutics applications. Biorefinery approach has been highlighted for sustainable production of value added products.
Key findings and conclusion
The high content of carbohydrate (55%) in pineapple waste makes it an appropriate substrate for the production of valuable chemicals such as xylitol, xylooligosaccharides, lactic acid, succinic acid and others, which have potential application in the food industry. The enzyme, bromelain, which is present in pineapple, has potential for application in therapeutics as well as in the food industry. Such utilisation of waste could prove to be a better alternative in the mitigation of environmental problems and also to propose a novel method to produce valuable chemicals. Despite the opportunities, there are challenges in the valorisation of this waste, largely due to the poor understanding of its nutritional and economic value, gap in close-linked markets, logistics issues for plant scale-up. Since most of the research is limited to lab-scale studies, additional research is required to evaluate techno-economic feasibility of the processes involved in the bio-refinery with minimum environmental impact for effective transition to circular economy.}

abstract = {Summary
Aim of the study
We set out to develop and evaluate the morbidity of a non-invasive hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) procedure in mice. HIPEC has been shown to improve overall survival in treating ovarian cancer with peritoneal carcinomatosis. However, related complications, toxicity and the lack of randomized trials limits its widespread use. To improve the surgical technique, there is a need for animal models that allow teams to work on large groups without burdensome logistics.
Materials and methods
To develop the model, we first determined optimal HIPEC conditions in 20 Black Six mice without carcinomatosis. To evaluate HIPEC morbidity, peritoneal carcinomatosis cells of ovarian origin were injected into the peritoneum of 10 pathogen-free Nude mice. The mice underwent HIPEC 21 days later under general anesthesia. An inflow catheter was introduced into the left hypochondria and an outflow catheter was introduced into the left iliac fossa. Bath infusion was oxaliplatin (920mg/m2) at 43°C for 12minutes. The mice were monitored and sacrificed two weeks after the procedure.
Results
No deaths were observed during the procedure and infusion was well tolerated throughout the HIPEC. One mouse died the day after the procedure. No major dehydration, hemoperitoneum or evisceration was observed.
Conclusion
This mouse model of closed abdomen HIPEC has limited morbidity and could be a useful model to study HIPEC regimens and its effects on peritoneal carcinomatosis.}

Based on theoretical analysis, expert advice, and online content analysis, 10 dimensions about the textual content of OCRs were proposed in Study 1, namely, seller trustworthiness, logistics quality, and service quality (seller-related), product functionality, price, product quality, and product aesthetics (product-related), emotional attitudes, recommendation expressions, and attitudinal loyalty (consumer-related). The differences in the proposed 10 dimensions mentioned in OCRs between American and Chinese consumers were statistically compared in Study 2. The data was collected from Amazon.com and Amazon.cn, which included 1565 OCRs of six products. The results show that the Chinese are more likely to mention seller trustworthiness, product functionality, price, product quality, and product aesthetics, while Americans are more likely to mention emotional attitudes and recommendation expressions in OCRs. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.}

Through comprehensive numerical experiments and statistical analysis, we found that the ALI and decision interval significantly influence the total cost, however, the diversion capability does not. The findings also reveal that the impact of the re-optimization interval depends on the subcontracting cost and the amount of advance load information provided. A major contribution of this work is the development of an efficient benchmark solution for the static version of the DPDFL through the discretization of time windows. We observed that using three-day ALI and an appropriate decision interval can reduce deviation from the benchmark solution to less than 8%.}

Cells obtained from alveolar bone were seeded in the BioMax scaffold prepared from autologous serum, expanded under GMP conditions, and subjected to osteogenic differentiation for 3–4 weeks before application. Evolution of the cystic cavity was followed by computerized tomography (CT) for 7 months. There was no inflammation or other adverse effects, and the CT density of the cyst interior increased significantly after the treatment. The ratio of the CT values after/before treatment was (mean ± SE) 2.52 ± 0.45; in contrast, the density of the contralateral control area of spongy alveolar bone without treatment did not change (ratio after/before, 0.99 ± 0.14). In conclusion, cell therapy with BioMax could be considered as an alternative therapy for maxillary bone defects and other losses of bone substance. Further research with allogeneic cells would be useful for reducing costs and improving logistics.

The demand for each stock keeping unit (SKU) at each store on each day needs to be determined to develop an effective and efficient inventory and logistics system for the retailer. The SKU-store-day demand is highly intermittent. In order to solve this challenging intermittent demand forecasting problem, we propose a greedy aggregation–decomposition method. It involves a new hierarchical forecasting structure and utilizes both aggregate and disaggregate forecasts, which differs from the classical bottom-up and top-down approach. The method is investigated on the real-world SKU-store-day demand database from this retailer in Singapore, and significantly outperforms other widely used intermittent demand forecasting methods. The proposed method also serves as a general self-improvement procedure for any intermittent time series forecasting method taking dual source of variations into account. Moreover, we introduce a revised mean absolute scaled error (RMASE) as a new accuracy measure for intermittent demand forecasting. It is a relative error measure, scale-independent, and compares with the error of zero forecasts.}

Among the different strategies being considered to reduce the impact food production has on the environment, only moderate has been paid to the extension of shelf life; a longer shelf life can reduce food losses as well as the economic and environmental impacts of the distribution logistics. The aim of this study is to assess the environmental performance of whole-wheat breadsticks with extended shelf lives and to evaluate whether the shelf-life extension is an effective mitigation solution from an environmental point of view. To this purpose, the life cycle assessment (LCA) approach was applied from a “cradle-to-grave” perspective. Rosmarinic acid was used as an antioxidant to extend the shelf life. To test the robustness of the results and to investigate the influence of the choices made in the modelling phase, a sensitivity and uncertainty analysis were carried out. The achieved results highlighted how, for 10 of the 12 evaluated impact categories, the shelf-life extension is a proper mitigation solution, and its effectiveness depends on the magnitude of product loss reduction that is achieved. The shelf-life extension doesn't allow for the reduction of environmental impact in the categories of human toxicity, cancer effects and freshwater eutrophication.}

The consumers should obtain the necessary quality and quantity level of the goods at the right time in the right place, etc., from a reliable supplier, with a sufficient level of service and a minimum level of total costs. Failure to comply with any of these requirements can lead to loss of customers or market share. The research study of the Ukrainian distribution system was made on the example of one of the national companies which sells building materials. The article defines irregularity in functioning of existing distribution channels. At the same time, the authors determine inefficiency of various distribution channels used by the participants of the retailers’ network in one region. To solve this problem, combining several material flows has been proposed. Serving clients together allows avoiding seasonality and makes goods volumes more sustainable. In this case, the use of the distribution center is rational. Applying a DC in customers consolidation areas allows increasing productivity and efficiency of the distribution system and improving logistics indicators. Obtained results are based on: scientific and practical analysis of irregular services of material flows; integrated and system approaches to data processing; an experimental method for implementing the distribution center in the distribution system; methods of project analysis evaluating the distribution system effectiveness.}

Despite strenuous efforts by public policy-makers to alter the freight modal split, most companies still rely heavily on road transportation, and modal shifts to rail and water have remained modest at best. In this paper we argue that this is partly the result of a failure to take a holistic supply chain view of the modal shift process. Synchromodality provides a framework within which shippers can manage their supply chains more flexibly to increase the potential for shifting mode. On the basis of a literature review, we broaden the conventional focus of multimodal transportation to give it a supply chain dimension, and propose the concept of ‘Synchromodality from a Supply Chain Perspective’ (SSCP). Using a case study we show that when the supply chain impacts are taken into account, it is possible to significantly increase the share of intermodal rail transportation within a corridor, without necessarily increasing total logistics cost or reducing the service level. In this way the environmental impact of freight activities can be significantly reduced.}

Many forestry workers had to engage in long distance labour commuting (LDLC). For most, this was their first experience with LDLC. By 2011, most of Mackenzie’s forest industry was back in operation. This research explores the impacts of LDLC on the experiences and personal development of workers in order to inform policies, programs, and community services to support workers during these experiences. It produces a greater understanding of how LDLC is reshaping the resiliency and opportunities for workers in rural labour landscapes. Key benefits of LDLC identified by workers included financial support, employment benefits, education and training, and work experience in other sectors. However, key concerns included transportation logistics, financial impacts, and safety. More attention is needed to develop flexible shift schedules; to support workers’ ongoing capacity and skills development; to invest in communication, conflict resolution, and problem-solving skills for workers; to invest in fatigue management training; to broaden the infrastructure and opportunities for interaction to connect workers with support networks; and to ensure information about local and non-local supports is current and available in multiple formats.}

In order to promote the development of LNG trucks in Shenzhen road freight industry, this paper aimed at forecasting the LNG filling demand and planning the stations construction. There are 6 sub-industries constituting Shenzhen road freight industry, which are port transportation, container transportation, dumper transportation, mixer truck transportation, dangerous cargo transportation and logistics transportation. Besides, three types of LNG filling stations with different applicability are discussed in this paper. Considering the variation of promotion targets during the next decade, the planning schedule was separated into 4 periods in which three types of stations have different priority of construction. Based on scenario analysis, we predicted the LNG trucks penetration and LNG filling demand of each sub-industry during each period. Then an optimization model was built to minimize the total costs and land areas of stations construction meeting the filling demand. As a result, the required number of LNG filling stations of each period can be calculated by solving the model. This paper contributed to the balance between demand and supply of LNG using in road freight of Shenzhen. In addition, the planning results can provide scientific evidences for government to make decisions.}

In this paper, we address the problem of volume estimation of goods stacked on pallets and transported in pallet trucks. Practical requirements of this industrial application are that the load of the moving pallet truck has to be measured in real-time, and that the measurement system should be non-invasive and non-contact, as well as robust and accurate. The main contribution of this paper is the design of simple, flexible, fast and robust algorithms for volume estimation. A significant feature of these algorithms is that they can be used in industrial environments and that they perform properly even when they use the information provided by different range devices working simultaneously. In addition, we propose a novel perception system for volume measurement consisting of a heterogeneous set of range sensors based on different technologies, such as time of flight and structured light, working simultaneously. Another key point of our proposal is the investigation of the performance of these sensors in terms of precision and accuracy under a diverse set of conditions. We also analyse their interferences and performance when they operate at the same time. Then, the analysis of this study is used to determine the final configuration of the cameras for the perception system. Real experiments proof the performance and reliability of the approach and demonstrate its validity for the industrial application considered.}

Using data on international trade of Turkish provinces and the change in the capacity of the roads connecting them to the international gateways of the country, we estimate the distance elasticity of trade associated with roads of varying capacity. Three key results emerge. First, the cost of an average shipment over a high-capacity expressway is about 70% lower than it is over single-lane roads. Second, the present value of a 10-year stream of trade flows generated by a one-dollar investment in road infrastructure ranges between $0.7 and $2. Third, the reduction in transportation costs is greater the more transportation-sensitive an industry is. To the extent that efficient logistics enable countries to take part in global supply chains and exploit their comparative advantages, our findings have important developmental implications.}

Clinical trials have demonstrated that three doses of either commercially available HPV vaccine, Cervarix ® or Gardasil ®, prevent most new HPV 16/18 infections and associated precancerous lesions. Based on evidence of immunological non-inferiority, 2-dose regimens have been licensed for adolescents in the United States, European Union, and elsewhere. However, if a single dose were effective, vaccine costs would be reduced substantially and the logistics of vaccination would be greatly simplified, enabling vaccination programs in developing countries. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the Agencia Costarricense de Investigaciones Biomédicas (ACIB) are conducting, with support from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a large 24,000 girl study to evaluate the efficacy of a 1-dose regimen. The first component of the study is a four-year non-inferiority trial comparing 1- to 2-dose regimens of the two licensed vaccines. The second component is an observational study that estimates the vaccine efficacy (VE) of each regimen by comparing the HPV infection rates in the trial arms to those in a contemporaneous survey group of unvaccinated girls. In this paper, we describe the design and statistical analysis for this study. We explain the advantage of defining non-inferiority on the absolute risk scale when the expected event rate is near 0 and, given this definition, suggest an approach to account for missing clinic visits. We then describe the problem of estimating VE in the absence of a randomized placebo arm and offer our solution.}

It consists in externalizing whole sub-processes (e.g., production, logistics, human resources) of a value chain. Last decade, the concept of value chain moved toward the more flexible concept of value net that implies the assembly of several value chains tailored to specifics, objectives, markets, etc. Thus, the composition of a value chain within a value net environments can be understood as the modeling of a macro business process in which sub-processes can be outsourced. Such composition activity foresees crucial decision-making moments that need to be sustained by a group of decision-makers owning several and heterogeneous competences in order to select the most suitable external providers to which delegate specific sub-processes. This work proposes a framework to enhance business process outsourcing by introducing group decision-making support that relies on a fuzzy linguistic consensus model. In addition, the framework implements algorithms to learn and assign different weights to decision-makers considering the context and time at which they participate in the group decision making. The framework is applied to an Italian footwear company by describing a numerical example.}

This paper focuses specifically on order-picking which is a key factor affecting warehouse performance. Order picking is the operation of retrieving goods from specified storage locations based on customer orders. Today’s warehouses face challenges for greater responsiveness to customer orders that require more flexibility than conventional strategies can offer. Hence, dynamic order-picking strategies that allow for changes of pick-lists during a pick cycle have attracted attention recently. In this paper we introduce an interventionist routing algorithm for optimising the dynamic order-picking routes. The algorithm is tested using a set of simulations based on an industrial case example. The results indicate that under a range of conditions, the proposed interventionist routing algorithm can outperform both static and heuristic dynamic order-picking routing algorithms.}

The system is composed of unreliable manufacturing and recovery machines in which one part type is produced to satisfy a given demand. In particular, the deterioration of the manufacturing machine, which is caused by the aging process, randomly affects its availability and the quality of the parts it produces. Defective parts produced by the manufacturing machine affect the failure process of the recovery machine during its remediation activity. Due to the deterioration effect, the system is unable to fulfill long-term product demand, and the manufacturing machine can be replaced in order to increase the production capacity of the hybrid system. The main objective of this study is to determine the optimal production plan, in terms of manufacturing and recovery, as well as the replacement strategy, for the manufacturing machine, minimizing the total cost over an infinite planning horizon. The optimality conditions are developed in the form of second-order Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations in order to capture the effects of random quality deterioration and of random machine failures and repairs for which first-order HJB equations have been successfully developed in the literature. We adopt numerical methods to solve the optimality equations, and a numerical example is presented to illustrate the proposed approach. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is considered in order to confirm the structure of the joint control policy obtained.}

The key issue is three fold and the optimum solution lies between: a) the selection of the most appropriate location for the establishment of each facility, b) the identification of the facility's attributes that should match the interest area's needs and c) the evaluation of the concept as considered to be part of the local policies and measures promoted or planned for the area of interest. The answer to the afore mentioned issues is provided through a two level approach incorporating the development of two discrete, but successive decision making supportive evaluation tools: a methodological approach to provide a solution to the facility location problem for Freight Centers and an integrated evaluation framework used for the assessment of the operation of the specific Freight Center category, the Urban Consolidation Centers (UCC). Both methodological frameworks are based on selected performance indicators, incorporating divergent stakeholders’ interests considering conflicting business models and operations.}

Burdens of poverty are often compounded by respiratory problems. This study aimed to identify the support needs and intervention preferences for low-income families facing this challenge.
Design and Methods
Interviews were conducted in two Canadian provinces with low-income children/adolescents (n=32) diagnosed with respiratory health problems and their parents or family caregiver (n=37).
Results
These vulnerable children and parents described non-supportive interactions with some health service providers and inadequate information. They reported isolation and support deficits, exacerbated by limited resources and health restrictions. Children/adolescents felt isolated and excluded and wanted to connect with peers. Group or dyadic level support, delivered by peers and health professionals, was desired. The importance of logistics to enhance accessibility and appeal of group or dyadic support interventions was clearly identified.
Conclusions
The findings of this study reveal that low-income children and their families encounter challenges to accessing support and to utilizing support resources.
Practice Implications
Partnerships with low-income children/adolescents and family caregivers in provision of education and social support can combat isolation and ignorance. Reducing inequities for this high risk population could be achieved by providing support from experienced peers, in combination with health professional guidance, and knowledge about pulmonary health.}

In addition, we formulate a Multi-Vessel Routing Problem with Pickups and Deliveries (mVRPPD) that leads to even larger economical gains, but also entails more important changes in the current planning and operations. To quantify and justify the benefits of the VRPSPD and mVRPPD, an industry case based on real data was constructed and solved for 300 days. The VRPSPD is solvable with a commercial solver for most real-size instances.

In the blood supply chain operated by the Thai Red Cross Society (TRCS), problems are faced with amounts of blood collected in different provinces of Thailand being insufficient to meet demand. At the present time, TRCS operates one National Blood Centre in the capital and twelve Regional Blood Centres in different provinces to collect, prepare, test, and distribute safe blood. A proposal has been made to extend this network of blood centres using low-cost collection and distribution centres. Increasing numbers of fixed collection sites can improve access for donors. In addition, some facilities will be able to perform preparation and storage for blood that hospitals can receive directly. This paper addresses the selection of sites for two types of facility, either a blood donation room only or donation room with a distribution centre. A range of investment budgets is investigated to inform the strategic plan of this non-profit organisation. We present a novel binary integer programming model for this location–allocation problem based on objectives of improving the supply of blood products while reducing costs of transportation. Computational results are reported, using real life data, that are of practical importance to decision makers.}

However, sustainability of biomass power plants requires meticulous planning starting from assessment of feedstock availability to collection, storage, transport and conversion in power plant. All these parameters are spatially inter-linked and therefore use of spatial tools such as GIS is helpful in such planning. This paper investigates electrical power generation potential of a newly constructed biomethanation plant in Sonitpur district of Assam, India. Spatial availability of locally available biomass feedstocks for methane generation is assessed using GIS. The GIS is also used for optimal biomass collection and transportation network design. Altogether, 7 different types of biomass feedstock (kitchen waste, vegetable waste, cow dung, pig droppings, goat droppings, poultry droppings and rice straw) are identified in the surrounding villages of the plant within optimum biomass supply radius. Biomass feedstock of the area can produce 37,000m3 methane; sufficient for continuous generation of 5.3MW electricity. Power supply from the proposed plant would improve rural living standard and key areas such as education and health will be particularly benefited. However, biomass assessment and supply logistics would require managerial attention to minimize cost of power generation.}

abstract = {The 24th IPSERA conference in Amsterdam addressed the various new competitive challenges organisations face now that business environments are rapidly changing. While we can observe an increased role of - but also an increased concentration in - logistic services and IT services acting as a bonding agent of the various business processes, we also see an increased specialisation among suppliers, resulting in roles like capacity supplier, co-maker and broker. In terms of Systems Thinking: the sub-system of ‘Suppliers’ is breaking up into three sub-systems with distinctive different characteristics, and the traditional sub-system ‘Purchasing’ has transformed into an aspect-system connecting or involving all other sub-systems, while similarly, ‘Logistics’ and ‘IT’ have developed into intertwined aspect-systems, being part of each and every sub-system. These transformations have increased managerial complexity, greatly influencing the purchasing and supply chain functions within firms. The seven papers selected from the conference examine seven aspects of those changes in detail and elaborate on the role of the PSM field in this process: PSM responds to challenges by providing answers on how to move forward in practice.}

abstract = {Relation extraction between medical concepts from electronic medical records has pervasive applications as well as significance. However, previous researches utilizing machine learning algorithms judge the semantic types of medical concept pair mentions independently. In fact, different concept pair mentions in the same context are of dependencies which can provide beneficial evidences for identifying their relation types. To the best of our knowledge, only one study has considered such dependencies in discharge summaries. However, its hard constraints are not applied effectively to the History of Present Illness (HPI) in electronic Medical Records. According to the writing characteristics of HPI records, we generalize two regularities of dependencies among concept pairs mentioned in an HPI record to enhance the performance of relation extraction. We incorporate the two soft constraints corresponding to the regularities and the posterior probabilities returned by a local classifier into a joint inference process which applies Integer Quadratic Programming method to carry out collective classification for all concept pair mentions in an HPI record. We implement four local classification models including support vector machine, logistics regression, random forest and piecewise convolutional neural networks to examine the performance of our approach. A series of experimental results demonstrate that our collective classification method has made a principal improvement and outperforms the other state-of-the-art methods.}

In this qualitative study, we examined the successes and challenges faced by a team of three elementary school teachers as they designed and implemented an arts-infused inquiry unit focused on wealth and poverty with kindergarten, first, and second grade students. Through a series of six interviews, teachers discussed how they planned and implemented the units and shared reflections on engaging in this novel work. Next steps for educational practice and research focused on supporting teachers in teaching about wealth and poverty are discussed.}

Elements within a manufacturing system are connected by a complex network of relations such as material flow, technological dependencies, infrastructure, and intangible cause-and-effect-chains. Depending on the scale of changes they may also interfere with engineering, procurement, logistics, or even manufacturing strategy. Thus, the total impact in terms of expected costs and required time for planning and implementation of those “manufacturing changes” is hard to predict. The objective of this paper is to provide a decision support for manufacturing change management and to enable a thorough analysis of changes in manufacturing systems. Although the topic of change propagation received considerable attention in product development in order to quantify the knock-on effects of engineering changes, comparable endeavors have not yet been made in the field of manufacturing science. Following a review of prevailing approaches from product development and manufacturing literature, a model-based approach for the prediction and assessment of change propagation in manufacturing systems is presented. Applied structural modeling techniques, the derived graph algorithm, and the proposed procedure of the approach are outlined. Finally, an industrial case study is presented to demonstrate the potential but also the limitations in practice.}

Lengthy and recurrent stockouts of essential health products (incl. contraceptives) were the rule, not the exception as they used to strike more than 80% of public service delivery points (SDPs). Following a successful pilot in two districts in 2012, the Senegalese Ministry of Health and Social Action (MSAS) implemented the Informed Push Model (IPM) Project (2013–2016). In its first two years, IPM bridged key gaps and expanded the distribution of contraceptives by private third party logistics operators to all public SDPs in Senegal and nearly eliminated stockouts. However, the MSAS was slow to take ownership of the project. Understanding the roots of this reluctance, executing a range of targeted communication and advocacy efforts and preparing a strong transition plan are succeeding to push Government toward full ownership to enable the National Supply Pharmacy to distribute all health products going to SDPs, including vaccines, consistently with their Strategic Plan 2014–2018.}

abstract = {Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to investigate how warehouse safety can be assessed and facilitated.
Methodology
Through a literature study, we build a theoretical framework to provide insights in how safety in Logistics Service Providers (LSPs) can be assessed and facilitated. We perform a case study at a large Dutch LSP using interviews and questionnaires to determine the relevance of the sub-dimensions to assess warehouse safety.
Findings
Using literature, we identify people, procedures and technology related sub-dimensions of safety culture and safety behavior and factors that may affect how safety culture translates to safety behavior. Using a case study our findings indicate which sub-dimensions and influencing factors LSP employees find important and why. We found differences in the importance assigned to safety, which may point to the existence of sub-cultures across warehouses.
Research limitations/implications
This paper contributes to the limited existing warehouse safety literature in which the factors that influence safety are not well explored. Although the case study investigates one LSP and as such does not generalize across LSPs, it provides valuable insights in important aspects of safety and how they can be influenced.
Practical implications
This paper offers safety managers insights in how to assess and facilitate safety within their warehouses.
Originality
Although warehouse safety is important, there is scarce academic research that explores this issue.}

Accurate yield estimation of fruit and vegetable crops is very important for better harvesting and marketing planning and logistics. This paper proposes a method for detecting the maturity levels (green, orange, and red) of fresh market tomatoes (Roma and Pear varieties) by combining the feature color value with the backpropagation neural network (BPNN) classification technique. A maturity detection device based on computer vision technology was designed specifically to acquire the tomato images in the lab. The tomato images were processed and the targets of the tomatoes were obtained based on the image processing technology. After that, the maximum inscribed circle of the tomato’s surface was identified as the color feature extraction area. The color feature extraction area was divided into five concentric circles (sub-domains). The average hue values of each sub-region were extracted as the feature color values and used to describe the maturity level of the samples. After that, the five feature color values were imported to the BPNN as input values to detect the maturity of the tomato samples. Analysis of the results shows that the average accuracy for detecting the three maturity levels of tomato samples using this method is 99.31%; and the standard deviation is 1.2%.}

The flip-side of such systems under distributed control is the rise of “myopic” (short-sighted) decision making, leading to system nervousness and loss of performance. Designing manufacturing (control) systems for distributed control hence is a significant challenge: With the system performance becoming an emergent property of the interplay of various decision making entities, system designers become conductors of societies of cyber-physical systems, seeking to balance the desirable traits of distributing control while limiting the negative effects of myopic decision making. In this contribution, we set out to help manufacturing system designers to better understand myopic behavior and the design decisions that are known to affect it. Our contribution can serve as a design aid for planners of distributed control systems by structuring the solution space of design decisions to control myopic behavior. By pointing to examples from various research streams, we provide guidance for system designers, seeking to maximize the performance of distributed production control systems.}

The analysis only focuses on two certifications representing in turn authorities and private standards. Research implications indicate distinctions between mandatory public certification standards and private ones. Findings may support transport and logistics managers in the analysis and comparison of private and public certifications or standards for decision-making. Previous research has not analyzed differences between public and private security standards. In addition, researchers claim that security certifications can improve both security and efficiency.

It helps in keeping a track over the quality, perishability and freshness of the fruits which are the foremost concern for maintaining customer satisfaction. In this paper, we consider a case of kiwifruit supply chain and analyze the impact of traceability using Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags. A multi-objective integer non-linear programming model (MOINLP) is formulated considering two objective functions which include (i) minimization of the total costs incorporating logistics costs and costs of implementing RFID tags and (ii) minimization of liability costs on occurrence of contamination. To compute this problem, a newly developed approach of Plant Pollinator Optimization Algorithm (PPO) has been implemented and a comparison with the well-known Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) is performed. Insights evolving out of this study can help the Supply Chain Managers in minimizing the risks of delivery of perished fruits by tracing it at an earlier stage and thus reducing the liability costs.}

This research investigates the effects of shipping knowledge, attitude and reference group opinions on the intention of maritime students to work on-board basing on the knowledge, attitude and intention (KAI) model. Using questionnaire surveys collected from 243 students studying in the maritime and logistics related departments at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) and Maritime Services Training Institute (MSTI) in Hong Kong. This research finds that the attitude and reference group opinions positively influence students’ intention to work on-board. Although the research hypothesis of the direct influence of shipping knowledge on the intention to work on-board was not supported. Specifically, this research finds the indirect influence of shipping knowledge and reference group opinions on students’ on-board intention through attitude. This research provides a comprehensive insight to understand the determinants of students’ on-board intention.

Market constraints include the significant difficulty, and associated costs, in obtaining access to markets around the world. Advances in the biology of plant water management, including response to water deficit reveal new opportunities to improve crop response to water deficit and new genome-based tools promise to usher in the next era of crop improvement.

Despite the benefits of these suspensions, nano-bonded castables usually present limited green mechanical strength and different on site logistics to handle the liquid. Considering the availability of novel alumina-silica-based powdered binders, this work investigated the role of submicron alumina and SioxX®-Zero (both supplied by Elkem company) on rheological and mechanical properties of vibratable high-alumina castables, aiming to identify whether they can be suitable options to replace colloidal silica suspensions. Cold and hot mechanical strength and apparent porosity in the range of 110–1400 °C, cyclic thermal shock resistance, creep tests and hot elastic modulus of the designed formulations were evaluated. According to the results, SioxX®-Zero-bonded compositions presented good flowability levels and their sintering process started around 800 °C. Adding boron carbide to the same formulations resulted in transient liquid sintering of the silica-containing refractories, which allowed the development of compositions with improved thermo-mechanical performance in the 600–1400 °C temperature range. Furthermore, the submicron alumina-bonded samples presented fast sintering, resulting in E values close to 200 GPa (the highest value so far registered in our lab for a coarse grain size formulation) after one heating-cooling thermal-cycle up to 1400 °C.}

Specifically, we ask if agroecology can lead to improved food security and human health among vulnerable smallholder farmers in semi-humid tropical Africa. The empirical evidence comes from a cross-sectional household survey (n=1000) in two districts in Malawi, a small country in semi-humid, tropical Africa. The survey consisted of 571 agroecology-adoption and 429 non-agroecology-adoption households. Ordered logistics regression and average treatment effects models were used to determine the effect of agroecology adoption on self-reported health. Our results show that agroecology-adoption households (OR=1.37, p=0.05) were more likely to report optimal health status, and the average treatment effect shows that adopters were 12% more likely to be in optimal health. Furthermore, being moderately food insecure (OR=0.59, p=0.05) and severely food insecure (OR=0.89, p=0.10) were associated with less likelihood of reporting optimal health status. The paper concludes that with the adoption of agroecology in the semi-humid tropics, it is possible for households to diversify their crops and diets, a condition that has strong implications for improved food security, good nutrition and human health.}

While this is traditionally understood as analyzing the customer needs and how to bridge that gap, for example, through segmentation and branding activities, this chapter has focused on bridging the gaps between industrial actors in order to build networks. The rationale behind this focus relates to the fact that science- and technology-based start-ups often do not sell directly to the end consumer or user; instead marketing activities are often targeted toward industrial actors. The formation of network relationships is necessary for value creation. However, network-building activities can be particularly troublesome for newly formed firms as they often lack resources and business legitimacy. This chapter discusses how start-up firms interact, how their networks are built, and what contributions various actors have in terms of how they add to the possibility of the start-up developing in the long term. Two cases are presented and particular interest is aimed at the actors with whom the start-ups interact in the innovation support and business spheres, respectively. The chapter describes how the logistics of these two spheres differ and how they affect the start-up firms.}

After describing the latest state of the art on this topic, the novelty of the paper is in being the first to adapt the NewsVendor model from Logistics in order to guarantee a cost-effective bandwidth provisioning in MWCNs. Then, we study the economic sustainability of the proposed approach compared to the one based on the adaptive period inventory management policy, already presented in the literature. Numerical results show that the NewsVendor model outperforms the adaptive period inventory management policy in all the cases under investigation. It provides decision makers with more stable supply solutions by taking into consideration both the randomness of the bandwidth requirements and its short-term lifetime. In addition, it also improves both the total profit and user satisfaction levels.}

Clinical/phenotype data are matched to the International Paediatric and Congenital Cardiac Code (IPCCC) and the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision (ICD-10). The DNA collection currently comprises samples from approximately 4200 participants with a wide range of CHD phenotypes. The collection covers about 430 trios and 120 families with more than one affected member. The cardiac tissue collection comprises 1143 tissue samples from 556 patients after open heart surgery. The CHD-Biobank provides a comprehensive basis for research in the field of CHD with high standards of data privacy, IT management, and sample logistics.}

abstract = {The paper aims at investigating the needs of three sets of stakeholders – retailers and HoReCa, transport operators and local authorities – aimed at designing a dynamic and participatory platform of services and applications for the optimisation of the last mile urban logistics. The research has been carried out in the city of Torino where some integrated services will be introduced: a) management and booking of loading/unloading areas; b) experimental dropbox for collection and delivery; c) the introduction of dynamic access to the limited traffic zone (ZTL, Zona a Traffico Limitato); d) real-time dynamic optimisation of routes. To meet this goal a survey has been administered to a sample of transport operators, points of sale, public administration. The survey has been designed using a quali-quantitative method (web-questionnaire, interviews and focus groups). The results have showed a large gap between the needs of the operators (transport operators and retailers) and the strategies that the administration would seek to implement. A lack of interaction between the stakeholders has led to misperceive the problems that the carriers have to face daily and to overestimate the importance of the technology in solving the last mile issues. Prior to designing complex and expensive platforms, it is fundamental to implement some basic measures, closely related to the efficiency of the unloading and delivery of goods within the urban centre.}

More importantly, it examines whether this relationship between SCCs and GO is contingent on corporate environmental proactivity (EP). Theoretical predictions of the conceptual model were tested using hierarchical regression analyses of data obtained from 225 senior logistics/supply chain managers in the global auto sector. To ensure the robustness of our findings, a post-hoc analysis using the partial least squares approach was conducted. Significant positive associations exist between specific SCCs and the adoption of GO strategies. EP positively moderates the external integration capability – green purchasing and the supplier appraisal capability – green manufacturing linkages. However, unexpectedly, EP negatively moderates the effect of internal integration capability on green purchasing. Equally surprising, consistent negative moderation effects are detected for supply chain flexibility on green design, green purchasing, and green manufacturing. This study contributes to the existing resource-based view literature by focusing on the capability – strategy linkage and its specific application to environmental management. The exploration of the moderating effects of EP confirms the important role of organizing context in the effective exploitation and deployment of resources and capabilities.}

A mobile robot which initially used for surveillance, reconnaissance and patrolling, extended its footprint in the areas of explosive devices handling, mine laying, communications relays, logistics transportation, convoy protection, road clearance, target identification and tracking, remotely operated weapons, disaster management, hospitality sector, home automation, driverless cars etc. This mobility is hugely dependent on the autonomy of the robot. Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR) is one which is capable of traveling an uncontrolled arena without the supervision of the operator. Diverse approaches like vision-based techniques, fuzzy logic, artificial neural mapping, reactive navigation techniques, biologically inspired techniques, geometrical path planning etc. are used individually or combined to find the collision-free path. This paper discusses a new geometrical method called as Coordinate Reference Frame (CRF) approach for the navigation of mobile robot operating in a static environment consisting of elliptical obstacles. A mathematical formulation has been developed to obtain these paths and Center of Gravity Approach (CGA) is used to find the shortest among all obtained paths. The simulation results were implemented with an experiment. The results prove that the proposed approach to be very effective as the robot navigates to the defined target point without colliding with the obstacles in the arena. The cost involved in this project is very minimal, which makes this robot suitable for industries, hospitals, hotels, offices, etc. These kind of robots are very suitable for home robots, transportation robots, service robots, etc.}

While current engagement coalesce around cardiovascular disease, cancers, chronic respiratory disease, and diabetes, very little attention has been given to other important chronic conditions: e.g., allergic disease. Concerns about how health is shaped by context and experienced in place can provide important insights to understand the trajectory of allergic disease and inform policy especially in developing countries experiencing an epidemiologic transition. Using Ghana as a case study. this paper draw on theories of political ecology of health to enhance our understanding of how individual (e.g. care seeking behaviours), sociocultural (e.g. lack of education and awareness), health system (e.g. absence of logistics) and policy environments (e.g. absence of policy) influence the ways in which food allergy is perceived, diagnosed and managed. These findings highlight the need for decision makers to target structural factors that impede access to and utilization of healthcare, diagnostic practices, as well as food allergy coping and management strategies. Moreover, the findings highlight the need for a global health agenda that pays critical attention to place-based factors in the construction of emerging health risks.}

Previous research on the risks in prefabrication construction projects has mainly focused on the construction stage and has been confined to issues of completeness and accuracy without consideration of stakeholder-related risks and their cause-and-effect relationships. However, in reality, the supply chain is inseparable as precast components should be manufactured and transported to sites to fit in with the schedule of on-site assembly in seamless connection manner, and most risks are interrelated and associated with various stakeholders. This study applies social network analysis (SNA) to recognize and investigate the underlying network of stakeholder-associated risk factors in prefabrication housing construction projects. Critical risks and relationships that have important roles in structuring the entire network of PHP are identified and analyzed. BIM (Building Information Modeling)-centered strategies are proposed to facilitate stakeholder communication and mitigate critical schedule risks and interactions underlying the risk network. This study not only provides an effective method to analyze stakeholder-associated risk factors and to evaluate the effect of these risk factors from a network perspective, but also offers a new visual perspective in the promotion of the use of the Internet of things (IoT) and helps identify housing construction problems in Hong Kong.}

Further, the sizing decision is not an isolated one and is closely linked to fleet routing, inventory management and other aspects of logistics and supply chain management. Traditional methods to determine the size of fleets rely on coarse models of the supply chain. In this paper, we present a detailed agent-based simulation model of a multisite chemical supply chain that brings out the intricacies of the tank car fleet sizing problem. The model explicitly takes into account the independent decision making of the different entities as well as the interactions across operations such as replenishment planning and order assignment. Our simulation studies show that different fleet sizes and routing policies can have significant impact on the overall performance of the supply chain including on customer satisfaction and plant performance.}

Additionally, a heuristic model is proposed to provide the solution when the mode of transportation is limited to TL and LTL shipments. The procedures for solving each model are developed based on two challenges in transportation: incapacitated shipments and capacitated shipments. Moreover, numerical examples are given to illustrate the proposed models based on four aspects: total costs, order quantity, the number of deliveries, and production batch quantity. The three proposed models are subsequently compared to reveal results for managers to consider for improving the performance of their supply chain.}

As a special area supervised by China’s Customs, a typical free trade port zone is currently undergoing upgradation and transitioning into a free trade zone. Its development performance is the key factor in this process. In this study, a development performance evaluation system for a typical free trade port zone was established on the basis of theoretical models and empirical research. Six typical free trade port zones were selected in China’s coastal areas: Yangshan, Yantai, Xiamen Haicang, Guangzhou Nansha, Ningbo Meishan and Tianjin Dongjiang. The development performances of these zones were evaluated using a system built by combining an analytic hierarchy process with a grey relational analysis. Additionally, empirical research was conducted for these six free trade port zones. By comparing the development levels of these zones, the main problems in each zone were identified, and upgrade measures were proposed.}

abstract = {Current manufacturing systems are subjected to a high level of dynamics due to shorter product lifecycles, increasing customer requirements, and high fluctuations in demand. Therefore, present production planning and control is required to react quickly and flexibly to this increasing dynamics. Modern ICT merges with logistics systems and thus drives the transition from centralized to decentralized production control. Within this context, logistic objects receive the ability to communicate with each other and to make autonomous control decisions. Assuming bilateral communication between all entities, a linear increase in the number of entities results in an exponential growth in the coordination effort. To keep this effort as low as possible and simultaneously ensure the achievement of logistical objectives, it is promising to pool several workstations to clusters, so that decision making takes place inside the clusters. Clusters can be formed based on the underlying material flow system, modeled as a complex network. In this context, recent studies have shown that networks of the same class, such as social networks, biological networks, or communication networks have similar characteristics in terms of their cluster structure. We hypothesize that this fact is also applicable to material flow networks. Following, the aim of this paper is the structural characterization of clusters of material flow networks to support the introduction of decentralized control.}

Project aim was to examine the feasibility and logistics of mentored self-directed learning (MSDL) through group and individual presentations in an accelerated modified block curriculum. Perspectives of students and faculty members toward the incorporation of MSDL were also explored.
Educational activity and setting
During a two-week pharmacotherapy block, students made group presentations requiring two elements: a case presentation on curricular content (Element-1) and an inclusion of “novel” information students did not receive didactically (Element-2). Curricular content for Element-1 stemmed from a pharmacotherapy course on gastroenterology and nutrition, and individual presentations were scheduled during a semester-long skill-based course. Surveys on student perspectives were conducted at baseline, after group presentations, and after individual presentations. Faculty members also provided feedback and evaluations.
Findings
Whereas 58% of students considered a case presentation (Element-1) more valuable for their learning than inclusion of Element-2, 78% of faculty's responses indicated the incorporation of both Elements was valuable. For the following individual presentations, 73% of students were willing and able to present a topic not extensively addressed in the didactic curriculum by employing MSDL. Students improved their confidence in preparing and making presentations for peers and faculty/preceptors through the MSDL activities (p < 0.025). At the end of this project, the faculty determined 88% of students were ready to give a presentation considered appropriate for Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experience.
Discussion
MSDL through group and individual presentation activities were feasible and provided a valuable learning experience for students in an accelerated modified block curriculum.}

Profitability requires complex production and logistics chains and long payback horizons, and mining is environmentally- and socially-intrusive and extensive.

In spite of its increased popularity, little is known about the implementation struggles of incumbent firms across industrial sectors. Furthermore, although the notion of circular production systems is at the intersection of different research areas such as sustainable product design, sustainable supply chains, and reverse logistics, knowledge on how these concepts combine to ease or impede firms' transition towards circularity is scarce. To shed light on these gaps, I used multiple case studies from Cradle to Cradle certified companies in the textile industry in Europe. By employing qualitative research, I identified a set of factors along the textile value chain, from product design to take-back and reprocessing, that are crucial in expediting or delaying a firm's aspirations to develop a circular product. The main contribution of this paper is the dynamic understanding of how certain collaborative supplier-buyer innovation factors (i.e., supply chain position, power balance, and a shared vision) coupled with complex aspects in product design, namely in basic materials, architecture, and functionality, combine to determine the output speed and quantity of circular products to be sold, taken back, and ultimately regenerated.}

Overwhelmed with the scale of the problem, city authorities frequently seek public-private partnerships with firms (both local and international) to address the problem. While city authorities’ efforts maybe praiseworthy, the problem seems intractable. Using a case study from Berekum municipality in Ghana, this paper demonstrates how a lack of attention to the role of urbanites in MSWM has contributed to poor state of solid waste management (SWM). It presents a situational analysis of MSWM, and perceptions and roles of urbanites in the MSWM. Using agency interviews and household surveys, findings indicate that the state of MSWM reflects the indescribable condition of filth across many African countries. Although household respondents expressed willingness to actively participate in MSWM (e.g., provision of logistics, supervision of SWM activities etc.), they are not involved by the government agencies who consider MSWM as government’s responsibility. Unfortunately, the political economy of awarding SWM contracts to political party supporters and financiers have contributed to poor SWM. As a consequence, some households are gradually becoming apathetic to MSWM issues due to their non-involvement. Policy recommendations to improve MSWM are proffered.}

One major issue is that these buildings must be refurbished at low cost, not to increase the rents too much. The refurbishment process should be conducted with limited disturbance of the tenants. Existing façade renovation methods can be improved to decrease inefficiency and risk for contractors. The business situation is unclear, due to unclear means for refurbishment. One aspect of this problem is that there is a need for new business models. This paper studies the market and process optimization and proposals for information management aspects considering the need for developed business models in refurbishment. The study is part of a larger project about façade renovations with prefabricated wooden elements. The main contribution in this paper is to propose a new business model with standardized products, logistics and project management, discussing different aspects of efficient business models. There is a need for clear distribution of risks for the business partners and a clarification of potential co-benefits. Basically we propose a contract model with a contractor taking the full responsibility towards the client, including the detailed refurbishment design and project management.}

Research has addressed the relationship that organizational safety has with the psychological constructs of organizational identification (OID), and empowerment. This study used work-related risks, OID, and empowerment, as predictors of organizational outcomes: safety participation, reported intention to quit, and absenteeism, on a sample of 205 managerial employees from an Australian transport and logistics organization. Ford and Tetrick’s (2011) workplace safety model was extended to examine the moderating effects of perceived supervisor safety practices, and physical and psychosocial safety climates on the relationship between OID, empowerment, and organizational outcomes. While OID and supervisor safety practices (negatively) predicted intention to quit, risk exposure, OID, supervisor safety practices, and safety climate predicted safety participation. However, absenteeism was only predicted by empowerment (impact). The higher an employee’s workplace empowerment, combined with the more positively they rated their supervisor’s safety practices, predicted increased safety participation in the workplace, highlighting a moderating effect. A revised model described relationships between contextual, organizational safety, and psychological variables. Results provided a foundation for further research into relationships between workplace risks, psychological variables, safety factors, and organizational outcomes.}

Single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with over 250 different phenotypes have been identified by genome-wide association studies. Lack of large cohorts with adequately defined phenotypes has hindered further progress. This hindrance in genetic research can be overcome by electronic health records. These electronic health records have been recognized as a viable and efficient model for genetic research. The drawback of currently existing digitalized data and information in multiple unstructured formats continue to generate huge amount of information leading to difficulty in accessing invaluable and newly discovered knowledge. Connecting molecular data, individual genome sequence, patient phenotype, experimental data, and follow-up details is a big task. Road block to this monumental task of integration and interoperability are ethical, legal, and logistics. Data security and protection of patient rights are a must to maintain public support. In this chapter we have highlighted the advantages and challenges of using electronic health record data for genetic research as well as novel approaches and significant initiatives contributing toward precision medicine.}

The complexity of export processes challenges integration efforts, augmenting the need for specialized decision support systems to organize and systemize export decisions. The goal of this paper is to introduce an approach for the design of a decision support system that supports the wood product export process of a Chilean enterprise. The approach is focused on minimizing cost and obtaining a better global service level. The different actors involved in the wood export process are studied, with a particular focus on the negotiation process between the wood enterprise and shipping companies. The decision support system relies on an order management model for the logistics management of the enterprise to adequately solve the supplier selection and order allocation problems. The order management model relies on lexicographic goal programming to account for the multi-criteria nature of the underlying decision process. A case study is used to illustrate the benefits of the proposal.}

Such models typically use flows concerning the products only as the unit of analysis. This paper intends to provide a basis for developing new CLSC models, extending them to recovery resources from general outputs (e.g. unavoidable waste) with no value in terms of products. The new models affect also the configuration of the CLSC, with different set of resource suppliers and logistics providers. The case study analysed in this paper derives from the food sector, in which the waste produced is reused as a resource, avoiding the disposal of different materials through resource-recovery activities that allow waste to be returned to the main supply chain as valuable inputs to configure a new supply chain. The principal objective of this study is to create a new sustainable model of CLSC using and recovering waste from meat processing. A profitability indicator, an energy self-sufficiency one and a qualitative assessment of social implications are introduced to evaluate global sustainability opportunities for activating new loops.}

Due to a high demand fluctuation of e-commerce, the workforce sizing for the logistic chain is a challenging problem. Companies have to develop good strategies to have a sustainable workforce size while guaranteeing a high-level service. In this paper, we consider the management of the workforce for a warehouse of an e-commerce company. Specifically, we address issues as i) How the workforce at the warehouse can be determined; ii) What is the daily operational production planning; iii) How the demand peaks can be smoothed, and the production maintained ideally constant over the time horizon. To provide answers to these issues, we introduce the Packaging and Shipping Problem (PSP). The PSP looks for a solution approach that jointly determines the workforce over a multi-period horizon and daily operational plans while minimizing the total logistics cost. We consider two strategies that aim to enhance the flexibility of the process and the efficiency of resources use: reassignment and postponement. To tackle the Packaging and Shipping Problem we propose a model, and a three-phase matheuristic. This heuristic is proved to be competitive with respect to the direct solution of the model with a commercial solver on real-life based instances.}

However, targeting infrequent molecular alterations entails a series of special challenges.

abstract = {Introduction
The purpose of this national survey was to determine what constitutes a curricular track or concentration within colleges and schools of pharmacy. Additionally, for programs not currently offering curricular tracks or concentrations, this survey sought to identify barriers to implementation.
Methods
A survey instrument was developed and piloted. It was distributed electronically via SurveyMonkey to members of the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy (AACP) Curriculum Special Interest Group (SIG) contact list, along with academic affairs contacts for the balance of programs not included on the SIG contact list, as obtained via a targeted website search.
Results
Sixty-five of 134 programs responded to the survey (48.5%). Sixteen programs currently offer 38 curricular tracks or concentrations. On average, tracks or concentrations contained 10.6 didactic credits, with 4.6 elective and six required didactic credits; 0.7 introductory pharmacy practice experience (IPPE) credits; and 5.3 advanced pharmacy practice experience (APPE) credits, with 2.8 elective and 2.5 required APPE credits. Most tracks did not require a summative project (n = 13), while some required completion of a project individualized by interest/needs (n = 7). Forty-nine programs do not currently offer curricular tracks, most frequently due to logistics of faculty, oversight, or the curriculum structure. Of these programs not currently offering curricular tracks or concentrations, 38.8% are currently considering implementation.
Conclusion
Existing tracks or concentrations are highly variable in their composition. Many colleges and schools of pharmacy are considering implementation of curricular tracks or concentrations; this report provides guidance for appropriate rigor and development considerations.}

Two factors emerged within each of the three constructs defining the collaboration index: information sharing (price information and logistics), decision synchronization (exception management and general management) incentive alignment (risk sharing and technical support). The study contributes to defining a method for designing specific collaboration indexes in different food and fibre chains. The index provided relevant context-related information supporting the collaboration strategies in the Egyptian organic cotton chain.}

Cyanobacteria are being investigated for the production of biofuels directly from carbon dioxide, thus eliminating the steps of biomass production, harvest, logistics, and conversion required for 1st and 2nd generation biofuels.

PCC 7120, Anabaena variabilis ATCC 29413, and Nostoc punctiforme ATCC 29133 to four potential biofuels: farnesene, myrcene, linalool, and limonene. These cyanobacteria were then subjected to three rounds of directed evolution where the strains were exposed to increasing titers of each chemical. This led to a library of 12 putative mutants with higher tolerance to individual chemicals. These mutants were assessed for growth performance at chemical titers higher than the wildtype strains could tolerate. Power analysis was used to determine the necessary sample size to achieve statistical power of ≥0.95. Student's t-tests were performed to determine if the putative mutants had significantly improved growth parameters compared to the wildtype, thereby establishing whether an inheritable genetic change or possibly an epigenetic change had occurred. Three mutants were confirmed as having higher tolerance to individual chemicals. This work serves as proof-of-concept that directed evolution is a valid methodology to increase the tolerance of filamentous cyanobacteria to biofuels.}

Modern biological and biophysical techniques were combined to in-depth characterize the thermostability of a formulated rabies virus (RABV) in terms of antigenic and genomic titer, virus particle count and aggregation state. Tunable resistive pulse sensing (TRPS) and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) were used to count virus particles while simultaneously determining their size distribution. RABV antigenicity was assessed by NTA using a monoclonal antibody that recognize a rabies glycoprotein (G protein) conformational epitope, enabling to specifically count antigenic rabies viruses. Agreement between antigenicity results from NTA and conventional method, as ELISA, was demonstrated. Additionally, NTA and ELISA showed mirrored loss of RABV antigenicity during forced degradation studies performed between 5 °C and 45 °C temperature exposure for one month. Concomitant with decreased antigenicity, emergence of RABV particle populations larger than those expected for rabies family viruses was observed, suggesting RABV aggregation induced by thermal stress. Finally, using a kinetic-based modeling approach to explore forced degradation antigenicity data (NTA, ELISA), a two-step model accurately describing antigenicity loss was identified. This model predicted a RABV shelf-life of more than 3 years at 5 °C; significant loss of antigenicity was predicted for samples maintained several months at ambient temperature. This thorough characterization of RABV forced degradation study originally provided a time-temperature mapping of RABV stability.}

Alleviating the pressure from increasing freight transportation traffic via low-emission and innovative transportation methods can reduce problems such as transportation network capacity limits and environmental pollution and contribute to the development of resource-efficient and sustainable cities in the future. Underground freight transportation systems (UFTSs) can improve service quality and transportation efficiency in urban logistics and alleviate traffic congestion and associated problems such as energy consumption and air pollution. Previous studies on urban UFTSs have focused mostly on technical feasibility and policy requirements. Studies providing a quantitative analysis of the effects of introducing a UFTS on an existing transportation network are scarce. In this study, the main goal is to create a quantitative method to analyze the effects of introducing a UFTS on the performance of a transportation network. Thus, a multi-objective programming model of an integrated aboveground-underground transportation network that considers transportation cost, time, and emissions is created. The Yangshan port in Shanghai, China is used as an example to assess whether a UFTS can significantly reduce the cost, time, distance and emissions of the aboveground freight container transportation. The weights on three objective functions are varied to analyze their effects on the solution. These results provide a reference for optimizing freight distribution plans when a UFTS is constructed and for implementing integrated aboveground-underground transportation systems in the future.}

This study presents a novel variant of the PDP, called the multi-vehicle selective pickup and delivery problem (MVSPDP), and designs three metaheuristic algorithms for this problem. The MVSPDP aims to find the minimum-cost routes for a fleet of vehicles collecting and supplying commodities, subject to the constraints on vehicle capacity and travel distance. The problem formulation features relaxing the requirement of visiting all pickup nodes and enabling multiple vehicles for achieving transportation efficiency. To solve the MVSPDP, we propose three metaheuristic algorithms: tabu search (TS), genetic algorithm (GA), and scatter search (SS). A fixed-length representation is presented to indicate the varying number of vehicles used and the selection of pickup nodes. Furthermore, we devise four operators for TS, GA, and SS to handle the selection of pickup nodes, number of vehicles used, and their routes. The experimental results indicate that the three metaheuristic algorithms can effectively solve the MVSPDP. In particular, TS outperforms GA and SS in solution quality and convergence speed. In addition, the problem formulation produces substantially lower transportation costs than the PDP does, thus validating the utility of the MVSPDP.}

While it is typically processed through an anaerobic digestion process, sludge can also be a good feedstock for alternative fuel production. High-temperature steam gasification is a process that decomposes organic materials into synthesis gas (syngas) with a high hydrogen concentration. In this study, a lab-scale steam gasification system which converts sewage sludge into valuable syngas was developed and experimentally evaluated. This study specifically focuses on investigating the chemical kinetics of syngas generation and feedstock decomposition in a batch process. The syngas generation rates and concentrations of syngas constituents were measured, and changes in carbon balance during gasification were tracked with respect to time, which shows how reaction rates vary over time. It was found that variations in steam flow rates modified the gasification reactions both thermodynamically and hydrodynamically. The gasification processes were fitted into logistics curves to understand the effects of different steam flow rates. The results indicate that the chemical reaction velocity can be controlled to achieve optimum operating conditions, which potentially can reduce both processing time and steam consumption while maximizing the syngas yield. This study would contribute more to the complete understanding of the sewage sludge gasification processes and the kinetics of the gasification chemical reactions.}

abstract = {Background
Enhanced patient outcomes and accreditation criteria have led schools to integrate interprofessional education (IPE). While several studies describe IPE curricula at individual institutions, few examine practices across multiple institutions.
Purpose
To examine the IPE integration at different institutions and determine gaps where there is potential for improvement.
Method
In this mixed methods study, we obtained survey results from 16 U.S. medical schools, 14 of which reported IPE activities.
Results
The most common collaboration was between medical and nursing schools (93%). The prevalent format was shared curriculum, often including integrated modules (57%). Small group activities represented the majority (64%) of event settings, and simulation-based learning, games and role-play (71%) were the most utilized learning methods. Thirteen schools (81.3%) reported teaching IPE competencies, but significant variation existed. Gaps and barriers in the study include limitations of using a convenience sample, limited qualitative analysis, and survey by self-report.
Conclusions
Most IPE activities focused on the physician role. Implementation challenges included scheduling, logistics and financial support. A need for effective faculty development as well as measures to examine the link between IPE learning outcomes and patient outcomes were identified.}
