abstract = {We consider the optimization of the cross-docking operations at three INtermodal LOgistics Platforms (INLOPs) of a large European car manufacturer (ECM). The planning horizon is a week and the time bucket is a day. An inbound flow of products is gradually received over the week by truck from inland suppliers, and has to be loaded into containers which are then shipped to offshore production plants. The full content of a container must be available at the INLOP to enable its loading operations to start, hence temporary storage is needed. The objective is to minimize an inventory penalty, computed as the largest daily volume of temporary product storage observed over the planning horizon. The current practice at ECM is to first optimize the content of the inbound trucks and of the outbound containers independently, and then determine the loading day of each container to be shipped based on these fixed contents. We propose to integrate, within the same optimization framework, the decisions on both truck and container contents, which involve complex loading constraints related to the dimensions and weights of the products, with those on the scheduling of container loading. We model the resulting problem as a mixed integer linear program, and we develop a decomposition scheme for it, as well as a fix-and-optimize matheuristic. We perform extensive computational experiments on real instances provided by ECM. Results show that a combination of these two matheuristics is able to generate solutions that reduce the average inventory penalty by 40%.}

The delivery enterprise faced with incomplete information provides either high- or low-quality logistics services, while the e-firm regulates either actively or passively. Using an evolutionary game model, this paper seeks equilibrium strategies of the two parties under public supervision, with impacts of pertinent parameters on strategy selections illuminated. Analytical results indicate that the delivery firms rely mostly on comparative profit between high- and low-quality logistics services to make decisions, while the e-firms consult to monitoring cost rather than regulatory success rates to make selections between active and passive regulation. When public supervision stays at a relatively deficient level, passive supervision is preferred by the e-firm with the increase of consumer complaint rate. Still, it is possible to maintain the benefits of e-commerce corporations as well as enhance logistical performance in evolutionary games with the help of an operative supervision and punishment mechanism. Additional managerial insights are provided for discussion.}

abstract = {Densely populated cities, suffered from land scarcity, are often encountered the need of exploring new development areas. This initiative in developed cities usually includes reconsolidating container depots and proposing multi-storey cargo centre as part of urban development roadmap. Changes on road network and connectivity between ports and container depots affect the efficiency of container drayage operations. A novel container drayage optimization model incorporating the road network and connectivity metrics is developed to minimise the total traveling distance, truck fuel cost, container rental cost and container movements among multiple consignees and shippers. The model is adopted in assessing the container logistics low between the ports and the Hung Shui Kiu New Development Area (HSKNDA) in Hong Kong, one of the most densely populated cities in the world. In assessing the impact of HSKNDA towards container drayage operations in the environment of congested urban area, the road logistics connectivity is evaluated with graph theory-based network metrics using ArcGIS. Road network files are analysed using ArcMap and the road connectivity are evaluated on its completeness, circuitry and complexity using road connectivity metrics and ArcMap. The road connectivity of the circumstances before and after HSKNDA are evaluated and the results revealed that the alpha, beta and gamma indexes changed slightly but the node number, link number and link length are decreased, benefiting container truck movements. The results have been adopted in optimising the container drayage problem in HSKNDA, the operating cost has been reduced in four simulated scenarios when compared to the results obtained by the traditional approach. The proposed approach integrates the GIS and optimisation modelling to improve the effectiveness and reduce operating cost in container drayage process, contributing to the research with the development of the integrated novel container drayage model as a smart urban logistics for sustainable freight transportation and the evaluation of the road connectivity on the new development area. It provides optimal solutions for ship liners and logistics firms in restructuring the physical logistics network, enhancing liner operations efficiency, mitigating carbon emission, and enabling a higher quality of living in the city.}

This paper reviews blockchain technology and outlines possible uses for immutable distributed ledgers in operations and supply chains. A classification of the applications of blockchain technology in the scope of operations and supply chain management is presented. In order to demonstrate the technical architecture of the blockchain-based logistics monitoring system (BLMS), a reference implementation was programmed and tested based on Ethereum. The purpose of the BLMS is to provide a solution for parcel tracking in a supply chain to support an open and immutable history record for each transaction. The functionality of the system consists of transaction entry for logistics operators. The presented reference architecture demonstrates how blockchain can be implemented in the operations and supply chain context by using software components.}

In this context, the adoption of a collaboration strategy between various logistics actors can enhance the operational efficiency of the networks and reduce sustainability impacts. In this paper, we evaluate the economic, environmental and social benefits of the logistics collaboration using an integrated planning approach that simultaneously optimizes the inventory, location and routing decisions. Firstly, we propose and adapt a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model to design a collaborative and non-collaborative sustainable distribution network. Secondly, we examine one of the problems that can cause conflict between partners, namely the cost-sharing problem. Finally, we discuss a case study of a French distribution network. The obtained results show that collaboration in integrated planning can significantly reduce CO2 emissions, logistics costs and accident rate.}

abstract = {Current urban city logistics literature often claims that rising e-commerce and the associated courier-, express- and parcel- (CEP) deliveries are inherently responsible for the increase in urban road traffic and the related congestion, disturbances and delays within cities. However, existing research is so far limited concerning studies to what extent CEPs impact and contribute to urban road traffic, particularly in comparison with other commercial sectors and passenger cars. In response, collecting data through an extensive empirical survey, counting urban road traffic in the city of Vienna in Austria, this paper identifies the share of CEPs and other selected categories of road vehicles. Results show that the share of CEPs in urban road traffic consists of merely 0.8 per cent, while the delivery vans’ share of craftsmen/technicians is almost eight times bigger with 6.0 per cent. Overall, delivery vehicles comprise 13.5 per cent of the total urban road traffic in Vienna, thus policies to reduce traffic should include not only other commercial sectors, but should also focus on passenger cars comprising the majority with 86.5 per cent of total urban road traffic. This is the first study that specifically investigates the share of CEPs and other vehicle categories in the context of city logistics.}

abstract = {Given the expansion of the COVID-19 cases and the average infection rate globally, constructing a robust healthcare supply chain system for the crisis is highly crucial. The third-party logistics providers (3PLs), who can match the market demand with reliable manufacturers worldwide, have emerged as orchestrators. In addition to the basic transportation and storage services, some 3PLs can also provide procurement assistance to relatively small retailers. To illustrate the value of the above-mentioned business model, we build a game-theoretic model to capture participants’ optimal strategy in a healthcare supply chain consisting of a manufacturer, a 3PL provider, and a retailer. We also investigate the conditions where the performance in this business model outperforms the traditional model. It is concluded that the 3PL’s positive effect appears when the decentralized supply chain is characterized by high logistics outsourcing costs and high-level price sensitivity. We further design an incentive mechanism that can coordinate the supply chain. Finally, a series of numerical experiments are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.}

Identification of LTGs and quantifying their relationship with freight travel characteristics helps policymakers formulate necessary logistical interventions and reduce externalities from freight activity. Hence, this study proposes a methodology for identifying LTGs and exploring their interactions on freight travel, expenditure pattern, shipment pattern, and other establishment characteristics. A decision-tree approach called chi-squared automatic interaction detector (CHAID) algorithm is used to map these interactions. Results suggest that LTGs are distinctly associated with multiple variables such as shipment size, shipper expenditure, commodity classification, and business age characteristics. Business age is the best predictor across all models. These associations vary based on LTG definitions. Implications of this study would augment the efforts on interlinking LTGs with urban freight demand modeling systems and enable sustainable city logistics initiatives and last mile delivery management.}

In the survey, the significance of competitiveness, functionality of logistics, and information and communication technologies (ICT) among others were included. The results indicate that the importance of factors such as purchasing, demand forecasting and operations planning have increased. Overall, purchasing and demand forecasting are considered more important than other factors. Surprisingly, logistics was considered less vital in 2018 than in 2012. Most of the current challenges in companies arise from demand management (forecasting and planning), increasing labour costs and regulatory changes. On ICT side change has been from traditional communications more towards digital, and especially using specific platforms (portals, intranet/extranet).}

To improve the success of future humanitarian operations, it is of paramount importance to understand this relationship in detail and to identify mitigation actions, always considering the interdependencies between multiple independent actors in humanitarian logistics. In this paper, we develop a game-theoretic model in order to investigate the influence of transportation costs on distribution decisions in long-term relief operations and to evaluate measures for improving the fulfillment of beneficiary needs. The equilibrium of the model is a Generalized Nash Equilibrium, which has had few applications in the supply chain context to date. We formulate it, utilizing the construct of a Variational Equilibrium, as a Variational Inequality and perform numerical simulations in order to study the effects of three interventions: an increase in carrier competition, a reduction of transportation costs and an extension of framework agreements. The results yield important implications for policy makers and humanitarian organizations (HOs). Increasing the number of preselected carriers strengthens the bargaining power of HOs and improves impact up to a certain limit. The limit is reached when carriers set framework rates equal to transportation unit costs. Reductions of transportation costs have a consistently positive, but decreasing marginal benefit without any upper bound. They provide the highest benefit when the bargaining power of HOs is weak. On the contrary, extending framework agreements enables most improvements when the bargaining power of HOs is strong.}

abstract = {The construction industry is associated with low productivity growth rates and environmental harm and, has a crucial role to play to reach the SDGs adopted by the UN in 2015. Construction logistics offer useful solutions to improve both the productivity and sustainability of the industry. The purpose of this paper is to investigate, in detail, the environmental impact of construction transport and whether the building certification scheme for a construction project has any influence on its transport arrangements. The analysis in this paper is based on a multiple case study of 40 Swedish projects. The results show that construction projects with better environmental ratings generated less emissions from construction transport. However, among the ten projects with highest transport/m2, five were certified. Construction logistics solutions (CLSs) such as terminals and checkpoints are useful in reducing the number of transports, and thereby reducing emissions. But the usefulness of a CLS is influenced by gross floor area and type of project, as well as the phase which the solution is implemented in. This study contributes to a better understanding of construction transport patterns and reducing environmental harm of these transports. The results of this paper are beneficial for construction site managers, logistics consultants and transport companies, helping them to implement CLSs in a more useful way, depending on the phase and type of project.}

abstract = {To apply prefabricated wall panels to construction projects in a cost-effective manner, it is important to reduce logistics costs for stacking, transportation, and installation processes. However, currently stacking planners often generate stacking plans that incur unnecessary logistics costs. For example, generated plans often result in stacks that require panel reshuffling work or unstable stacks that require additional braces. To enable the planners to generate stacking plans rapidly and systematically considering not only the constraints of reshuffling effort and panel stability but also the objective of using the minimal number of trailers, the authors developed a methodology based on the first fit algorithm. By applying the methodology to two case projects, the authors found that it generates stacking plans with lower reshuffling effort and higher panel stability while using the same number of trailers and in a fraction of the time compared to the conventional practice.}

This study carried out interviews with 64 experts from the clothing trade and manufacturing industry on the conditions required for an innovative plastics transition. Statements were clustered, coded and statistically analysed according to the Triple Bottom Line Principle. It was shown that the greatest success is achieved when bioplastics clothing is recyclable, the development is carried out cooperatively and the product is returned via reverse logistics. Bioplastics apparel packaging, on the other hand, should be compostable, developed in-house and returned to the natural cycle by consumers themselves. While statements on material recycling were ecologically oriented, the opinions on the development and recycling process were mostly influenced by business interests. Significant effects could only be proven for the latter two. Absolute majorities were found for bioplastics in apparel packaging and for open innovation, whereas the views on the end-of-life option and on the degree of innovation potential of reverse logistics were balanced. The findings provide impulses for the most innovative plastics transition possible in the fashion industry.}

However, deviations from planned routes are common to observe in logistics practice, mainly caused by data unavailability on endogenous and exogenous customer constraints. The purpose of this study is to derive a machine-learning based approach to infer customer constraints from transactional data. We propose a probabilistic directed graphical model, using a Metropolis-Hastingswithin-Gibbs sampling algorithm for inference. Using a stylized problem inspired in a real-world dataset of delivery transactions, preliminary results suggests that our proposed method outperforms approaches based on simple counting of occurrences.

Given this focus, the paper identifies logistics systems comprising of a set of logistics activities as the machinery for assuring aggregate commodity security. Steady reliable supplies of health commodities, whenever and wherever they are needed, however, means looking beyond logistics systems. Health planners must ask whether there is a healthy supplier base for the commodities needed. The paper notes that a secure supply of health commodities in any LMIC, will remain an illusion without functional logistics systems supported by a healthy supplier base.}

abstract = {Background
Disaster management necessitates quick and effective response. The success of response largely depends on humanitarian logistics. A key component of humanitarian logistics is the prepositioning of relief items. The aim of this study was to explore factors behind the prepositioning of relief items.
Methods
This qualitative study was conducted in Iran. Study participants were twenty relief and rescue managers, researchers, and staff. In total, twenty face-to-face interviews were conducted for data collection. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed through conventional content analysis.
Findings
Factors behind the prepositioning of relief items were categorised into the following five main categories: sociopolitical factors (with the two subcategories of factors related to the political system and factors related to the society); resource management (with the three subcategories of human resources, financial resources, and physical resources); protocols, regulations, and agreements (with the two subcategories of development of protocols, regulations, and agreements and application of protocols, regulations, and agreements); risk assessment (with the two subcategories of identification of potential hazards in different areas of the country and assessment of the vulnerability of different areas of the country); and prediction, supply, and storage (with the two subcategories of prediction of necessary relief items and supply and storage of relief items).
Conclusion
A wide range of personal, managerial, professional, structural, environmental, and sociopolitical factors can affect the prepositioning of relief items. Lack of thorough risk assessment studies is the most important factor. Therefore, well-designed risk assessment studies are needed to determine the type and the amount of the relief items which should be prepositioned in each area. It is also required to determine the best time and site for their prepositioning. Developing measurement tools is also recommended to measure prepositioning-related needs of each area.}

The bio-based supply chain model was implemented to address the transportation, the inventory management and the size of the biorefinery. Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) was used as a modeling approach. The efficiency of the algorithm was demonstrated by applying it to a case study consisting of a wheat straw supply chain network for bioproducts demand in Germany. The algorithm reached convergence after three iterations providing a final optimal number of biorefineries distributed in different regions of the country corresponding to a maximum Net Present Value.}

Manure management requires the coordination of animal feeding operations (AFOs), centralized processing facilities (CPFs), and crop farms. Such a manure utilization chain is more than an individual farm scale, and it is a complex nexus between different production systems. In this study, the manure utilization chain, which recognizes manure management behaviors at different units of a region, was proposed to ensure sustainable manure utilization for distributed animal farms. The goal of this study was to develop a regional manure utilization chain (RMUC) model to minimize annual manure utilization costs by identifying the optimal manure flow patterns among AFOs, CPFs, and crop farms. The model was implemented to evaluate the manure utilization chain in Hangzhou, China. The results showed that the average solid manure logistics cost was CNY 20/ton (1 CNY ~ 0.14 USD), and the average slurry manure utilization cost was CNY 25.4/ton when the manure nutrients were adequately distributed. If the solid manure processing capacities of CPF were optimized, the average solid manure logistics cost would be reduced to CNY 8/ton. This paper also discusses the cost of executing the manure land application setbacks (the minimum distance required between manure application areas and sensitive areas). If Hangzhou followed manure land application restrictions of Illinois, U. S, the slurry manure utilization cost (CNY 65.8/ton) would be 2.59 times greater than the cost (CNY 25.4/ton) in the current scenario. Manure management would be more similar to other waste management and rely on centralized strategy instead of individual farm management.}

abstract = {Introduction: Due to the high rate of urbanization all over the world, the importance of the processes taking place within cities is increasing, Cities all over the world are growing rapidly with ever more intensive human interactions, dense vehicular flows and vigorous commercial activities. Thus the importance of city logistics is still growing. City logistics tends to be an important area, and it involves several levels of complexity. It consists of planning, coordination and controlling of logistics processes and various flows within urban areas. Logistics activities within cities, or especially city centres, generate externalities, therefore, looking for solutions improving the quality of life within cities is needed. The vast majority of studies on logistics flows within the cities, focus on analysing passengers flows and goods flows separately. Comparatively little is known about cumulative treatment of passengers’ and goods’ flows organization. Thus there is a particular need for a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of all flows within the city areas. It is possible to state that the objectives of city logistics are quite difficult to achieve in terms of the improvement in flows in urban areas, without their coordination provided by a specialised entity. Such an entity should be a coordinator, an organizer of the integrated system of urban transport, which would not differentiate its operation in terms of transported objects, but which would comprehensively make all its implemented functions universal in the administrative area in which it operates. Aim: The paper is aimed at developing a workable model of an entity organizing passengers and goods flows within the city areas. The proposed model could be an effective tool for local authorities to improve flows of the passengers and goods in the urban space. Methods: The research is mostly based on the analysis of practical solutions in the field of goods and people flows in European urban areas, documents of the European Commission and the publications prepared by industry associations. Moreover, the studies have been carried out on the basis of investigating public transport administrators, managers of transport and forwarding companies and city board representatives within the Pomeranian region. The theoretical part of the paper is based on the existing materials taken from public resources and the author’s research experience. Good practices within organization of passengers and goods transport in cities have been a subject of research and analysis, but – due to volume restrictions of the paper - haven’t been quoted. Results: The study result is an authorial framework of goods and passenger transport organiser within metropolitan areas, with the conceptual modelling of its functions. Thus, the organiser’s specialisation does not depend on the subject of transportation, its range comprehensively covers goods flows as well as passenger transportation. Conclusions: The main conclusion of the paper focus on highlighting future needs in the area of urban transportation. On the basis of the solution analysis relating to the flow of passengers and goods in metropolitan areas and the research carried out among the key stakeholders, it can be concluded that the involvement of a specialized transport and logistics integrator into such processes appears to be most advantageous. The article also presents a model of the integrator’s features.}

abstract = {Introduction
This article analyses the factors of trust, logistics, and conflict on darknet markets (DNMs) and forums that are dedicated to selling illicit drugs. The analysis is conducted by utilising Elias (1978) theoretical concept of ‘figuration,’ which refers to the communicative constellations that eventuate between actors.
Methods
A qualitative content analysis was applied to a sample collected from darknet forums related to darknet markets, independent forums with trade sections, and separate vendor shops. The main categories trust, logistics, and conflict are analysed, and certain subcategories are also explored, including operational security (opsec), vouching, and shilling. These terms are commonly used to describe the trading of drugs on the darknet.
Results
Users of DNMs and forums discuss vendors, their products, and security-related features. Vouching and shilling are attempts to strengthen trust, logistics are used to secure the trade, while conflicts reflected in forum discussion threads often arise when logistics fail. Logistics may fail due to different reasons and actors involved in the associated figurations. The (anticipated) presence of actors in disguise is crucial for all of the main categories.
Conclusion
Notions of trust, logistics, and conflict express attempts to cope with or circumvent risks imposed on users of DNMs by other users (e.g., scamming) or law enforcement (e.g., the interception of packages). Due to the illicit nature of the trade, these notions have to be constantly negotiated through digital communication.}

Although repairing by brand-new parts improve system reliability, repairing by degraded parts may not disturb the system failure rate and such maintenance is called minimal repair. The minimal repair maintenance is common for warships in the long voyage because their repair parts inventories are limited and degraded parts have to be exploited. Although system failures can be detected because the system operates peculiarly that the operator does not wish, some failures cannot be detected in operation and they are detected only by diagnoses. In this paper, these two types of failures should be considered when we plan the military system maintenance. Optimal inspection policies of two types of failures with minimal repair are proposed.}

abstract = {In the ongoing decade, port logistics in Europe have been exposed to intense competition. Especially container ports experience competition not only for ships but also for supply chains. To adapt to this trend, terminal operators are improving the efficiency in port logistics through, among other things, automation of port operations. Most of these efforts concern processes handling shipped goods. Instead of concentrating on these well-researched improvements, we explored the feasibility and economic potential of an intelligent lighting control system. Often automating handling processes need high investments in hard- and software. This smart lighting system is supposed to control demand-actuated outdoor lights in a harbour environment. In this research, movement profiles of straddle carriers and infrastructural data were gathered and refined to build a model of the observed container terminal. The modelled infrastructure includes the position of every lighting tower and its illuminant as well as their specific power consumption and the respective area, which those lights illume. To control these lights, we developed a control algorithm. We investigated through simulation experiments the power savings for this autonomous lighting control system. Multiple influential factors of this control concept were evaluated by varying the parameterization of the algorithm. A gathered data set, containing trajectories of operating straddle carriers during full terminal utilization, is the basis for the mentioned experiments. The results of varying the utilization rate of the terminal have identified a relationship between capacity and percental power consumption, in the form of a root function. The more straddle carriers run, the less the overall power consumption is increasing. Using the intelligent light control system on full utilization saves 14.67% of the total energy. In the case of 80 % terminal utilization, 18.22 % of total energy is subject for saving effects. Besides these results, we were able to explore the influences of the algorithm parameterization on the energy savings and could assess these solutions economically.}

Outsourcing is one of the solutions, in different areas of administration and especially in transportation. Then, being a strategic decision, it is pertinent to ask the questions: should it be externalized? and when?. The answer depends on factors that must be evaluated in each case. To make the decision, it is necessary first to evaluate if transport is a "key success factor" and it is a "basic competence" for the company. It is essential before defining what type of solution to give to the transport and depending on it, when it should be taken to make the business gain a competitive advantage. The proposed methodology distinguishes the relevant factors that allow a successful outsourcing, which are: people, infrastructure, ICTs, logistics management and business strategy, which will allow the development and growth of the business. Likewise, tools for business analysis, management, project evaluation and decision making, play a fundamental role in the qualitative and quantitative study of the proposed methodology, a decision model that allows the evaluation of the fleet’s externalization, through the possible transport management solutions. Finally, a map of the evaluation process is proposed, integrating the tools defined for the diagnosis, evaluation and definition of the decision.}

The study employed the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) statistical method to study the short-term and long-term relationship between endogenous and explanatory variables. The research results indicate that logistics and transport-related operations positively correlated with inbound tourism. Because logistics and transportation provide foreign tourist easy access to tourist destinations/places, while fossil fuel and carbon emissions have negative effects on inbound tourism in the context of Thailand. On the other hand, a greater level of crime discourages international tourists to visit and strongly negatively associated with inbound tourism both in the short-run and long-run. This research concludes with the importance of the logistics and transport sector that deem it is necessary to increase international tourists' arrivals and enhance the quality of inbound tourism. In addition, governmental authorities should enforce green practices in logistical and transport-related operations, and need to increase tourist safety and security, which may mitigate harmful effects on environmental sustainability, reduces criminal activities and also will attract foreign tourists respectively.}

abstract = {The closed-loop supply chain management (CLSCM) is an attractive research field for the corporate and academic worlds; however, closing the loop is not a simple task. Reverse logistics activities increase management complexities and uncertainties by establishing multi-fold collection and return management processes. Unlike traditional supply chain management, where managers deal with only stochastic demand, in closed-loop supply chain management, they deal with both stochastic demand and returns, which increases the cumulative uncertainty in the system. Firms usually use disposable packaging, and demand uncertainties also increase the negative environmental implications of logistics activities. This study aims to investigate optimal remanufacturing strategy and reusable packaging capacity under stochastic demand and return rate for single and multi-retailer closed-loop supply chain models. The results show that a hybrid policy is an optimal option for both single and multi-retailer cases; however, the rate of remanufacturing increases for multiple-retailers. Furthermore, remanufacturing cost, manufacturing cost, and ordering cost of retailers are the principal drivers of hybrid supply chain management. The results further suggest that supply chain managers should reduce manufacturing and remanufacturing costs because they play a central role in deciding the optimal remanufacturing rate. Increasing the remanufacturing rate increases ordering quantities and reduces setup and ordering costs in the system. Thus the remanufacturing is a relatively inexpensive policy for supply chains with higher setup and ordering costs. Numerical examples, sensitivity analysis, and comparative study show the robustness and validity of the proposed model.}

We explore the parallel machine scenario instead of the traditional flow shop setting and propose a polynomial parallel machine based heuristic that outperforms time-indexed mathematical formulation and state-of-the-art heuristics for small, moderate, and large size instances.

Like today, in PI the maritime ports will fulfil roles as continental and global hubs. Differently than ports today, however, decisions to split and bundle cargo across ships and other modes will not be made solely on the basis of long-term agreements by ports, but rather ever more dynamically and in real-time, aiming to reconsolidate shipments within the port area. This implies a need to reconsider the currently used information systems (ISs), and to gain understanding of future requirements to satisfy their needs. We exploit a design science research (DSR) approach to shape these requirements. Among the many components of future ISs, we study ports’ track-and-trace (T&T) capability. The proposed information architecture (IA) enables to integrate T&T capability in PI ports by means of information carried on PI containers into the logistics chain via an open interface platform, which also supports interoperability among the various actors’ ISs. The design is based on the Reference Architecture Model for Industry 4.0 (RAMI 4.0). This model supports the analysis of PI ports in key dimensions along with hierarchical logistics entities, which could be used as a blueprint for IAs of PI ports, globally. We provide insights into the approach’s applicability by means of the illustrative case of Teesport, located in Northeast England (United Kingdom).}

This paper proposes a bi-objective robust optimization model for strategic and operational response to decide the facility location, emergency resource allocation, and casualty transportation plans in a three-level rescue chain composed of casualty clusters, temporary facilities, and general hospitals. The Injury Severity Score (ISS) is adopted to divide the casualties into two categories and give the dynamic injury deterioration of casualties over time. Also, the model considers various uncertainties in demand including the number of casualties and the number of rescue supplies and transportation time. The objectives are to minimize the sum of ISS for all casualties and minimize the total costs of the system. Meanwhile, the penalty coefficients for untransported casualties are applied to maximize the transport number of casualties, and the penalty costs for unmet relief supplies are used to maximize the satisfaction of supplies demand at temporary facilities. We employ the robust optimization method to derive the robust corresponding model of the proposed stochastic model. The bi-objective model is solved with the ε-constraint method. Additionally, case studies based on Yushu Earthquake are utilized to demonstrate the feasibility and validity of the proposed model. Sensitivity analyses discuss the impact of uncertainties on the proposed model results by changing the settings of the uncertain parameters in the robust optimization, to make a tradeoff between optimization and robustness.}

There is also a lack of knowledge on specific technical and organizational issues faced by EFV adopters, particularly who are at an early stage of adoption. The aim of this paper is to obtain an in-depth understanding of the factors that influence the adoption of EFVs in urban freight transport fleets in Turkey. The analysis is based on review of literature and the feedback gathered from a workshop with relevant stakeholders, as a part of the activities realized under EUFAL (Electric urban freight and logistics) project, realized under the ERA-NET Cofound Electric Mobility Europe. The evaluation of workshop results shows that besides some persistent technical and operational issues, EFV adoption is limited by a clear lack of easily available and reliable information on factors affecting the EFV adoption decision.}

There is an objective need for arrangement of the organized and focused activity on human impact to the environment on the basis of scientific prediction of possible changes and consequences for the environment (planning of human activities and predicting the possible consequences).}

abstract = {A well-functioning logistics environment is key to a country's opportunities for trade, growth and employment. This is particularly relevant for developing countries, where a weak logistics environment often hampers trade. While logistics services are typically provided by private actors, national governments play a key role in ensuring high logistics performance, e.g. via infrastructure investments and regulatory reform. Given limited monetary resources, identifying the most critical investments is a crucial task for developing nations. We develop a decision framework as to which trade logistics interventions to prioritize in a country wishing to facilitate higher-value exports of perishable agricultural goods. The framework includes product-specific supply chain requirements. It is based on primary and secondary data analysis and a literature review. We apply the framework to the Kyrgyz Republic and present a country-specific gap analysis, using results from semi-structured interviews and secondary data analysis. Our results include policy recommendations for measures to improve the supply chain for agricultural goods in the Kyrgyz Republic. The framework can be applied to similar countries, i.e. middle-income countries, either landlocked or located far away from large export markets, with existing agricultural production but a low share of higher value agricultural exports.}

The strategic location of Kuwait has significantly helped the country to rely heavily on maritime trade for its economy. The main commercial port in Kuwait is Shuwaikh port, which currently faces many problems. These problems include traffic congestion on the internal roads and roads surrounding the port causing delays in the arrival of trucks loaded with goods as well as delays in the return of empty containers to the port. Additionally, container storage at Shuwaikh port is insufficient causing a significant reduction in the ship traffic over the last few years. This work aimed to establish a logistics city that supports the port of Shuwaikh and improves its performance. The logistics city also organizes the flow of trucks and provides an integrated environment to support many surrounding companies. This will increase port efficiency, trade mobility, storage capacity, competitiveness, reduce traffic congestion on the public streets by constructing special roads for trucks, reducing handling time and developing an international logistics center.}

Specifically, we take the impact of promised delivery time (PDT), which is of great significance in the online channel, into the consideration of sales channel choice. We first consider a single retailer and then extend the analysis to two competing retailers with joint quantity and PDT competition to analyse each retailer’s optimal sales channel strategy. The results demonstrate that the optimal sales channel depends on the logistics capability of the third-party logistics provider, the increased market size obtained by introducing an online channel and the degree of demand competition. Interestingly and counter intuitively, we find that introducing an online channel can hurt the retailer’s profit when the logistics capability coefficient is sufficiently small or large. This is because logistics capability has a significant impact on PDT and demand. We also find that with increasing of the degree of demand competition, the retailer with the larger market will be more likely to introduce an online channel.}

Unfortunately, the policy responses to solving congestion and emissions issues are mainly dedicated to the movement of people. The most valued opportunities to reduce the negative effects of freight delivery (the goal of EU policy is CO2 free urban logistics by 2030) regards both the use of electric vehicles to perform the distribution and the introduction of distribution centres that encourage the use of light commercial vehicles. However, the combination of zero emission vehicles in logistic and transportation activities requires some additional challenges from the organizational and operational point of view. In order to avoid the delocalization of polluting emissions it is necessary that the production of electricity related to the new needs comes from renewable sources preferably distributed throughout the territory. This paper explores the integration of electric vehicles in logistics operations executed through light commercial vehicles, taking into consideration, during the design phase of a new concept delivery van, the technical connections with the production systems and its possible applications also in areas other than urban. The results of the case study presented encourage the development of a type of vehicle with features not yet covered by the market and which are of particular relevance for sustainable logistics applied to small towns or small islands, which are widespread in Italy.}

The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the economic performance (cost and revenue) of such high capacity transportation vehicles compared to traditional smaller trucks. Data has been collected from real transport logistics service providers. A performance evaluation model called COREPE was designed to present quantitative evaluation of one year of operating data: this model evaluates the economic performance of HCT and traditional trucks on three different long hauls using telemetry data and monthly truck operating data. The results show that HCT has overall higher cost compared to traditional. The size advantage HCT has over traditional translated into moderately higher revenue and profitability based on the available data. Factors such as seasonal variability, driver attitude and truck utilisation had a noticeable impact on cost.}

Integrating transaction cost economics, we propose the effectiveness of guanxi as a dependence coping strategy is contingent on the level of exchange hazards (i.e., uncertainty and asset specificity) in logistics outsourcing. Based on data collected from 149 3PL users in China, we found that guanxi is a more potent strategy in highly uncertain environments and less relevant when extensive relationship-specific assets are involved. Implications and directions of future research are discussed.}

The study aims to provide guidance on efficient organisation of logistics at the port of loading for maritime transport of wood chips. The economic effects of using an intermediate terminal as opposed to direct delivery to port were studied, as well as the relationships between production capacity and storage capacity. Discrete-Event Simulation was used to analyse scenarios where a variable part of the volume is handled through the terminal. The total supply cost, including chipping, transportation, storage and handling at inland terminal and port, as well as loading of the ship, varied between €6.73 and 7.85 per MWh in the different scenarios. The volume passing through the terminal had a significant influence on total cost, showing a supply chain cost increase of €0.78 per m3 (approximately €4.67 per dry tonne) for material delivered through the terminal. The difference in storage cost between port and inland terminal determines whether the terminal volumes affect costs, which was shown by a sensitivity analysis. Even so, the terminal offers a possibility to manage uncertainty, both in production rates and in shipping date, and influences the supply network. The main advantage of using a simulation technique for planning production and logistic flows is the visualisation of risks and margins.}

The results reveal that TOPSIS outperforms DEA in terms of both calculation complexity and sensitivity to changes in the number of suppliers. However, output rankings from the two models are found to be less than perfectly correlated. The paper concludes that utilizing both methods, as applied to just a small number of evaluation criteria and a relatively low level of detail in the data, produces a useful pooled shortlist of potential sustainable suppliers. This can then form the basis for a second stage application where either of the methods may be applied to a greater number of criteria that are specified to a higher level of detail. Even more critically, the results also have the potential to point to specific aspects for discussion when negotiating price and service quality commitments with potential sustainable suppliers.}

abstract = {Today, organizations outsource their logistics activities to third-party logistics (3PL) providers to focus more on their key capabilities. A 3PL company is an external provider that controls, manages, and provides logistics services for the manufacture. The success of a 3PL company tremendously depends on the design of its logistics network. This paper studies the problem of designing a reliable hub-and-spoke network using consolidation hubs considering disruption risks and product perishability. To lessen network failure risks, disruption is dealt with using backup facilities, fortification of facilities, and multiple sourcing simultaneously. This problem is formulated as a bi-objective MINLP model that decides on the location, number, and fortification of main and backup hubs and distribution centers, the location of backup facilities, the inventory of perishable products and the back-ordering of products to minimize the cost and time of the supply chain network simultaneously. One of the highlights of this model is that disruption of hubs and distribution centers, which have the role of storing and distributing products, affects product perishability because the storing and distributing conditions and requirements are not met under facilities disruption. The model is linearized, and the uncertainty of facility disruption probabilities is dealt with by using credibility-based possibilistic programming so that an optimal solution can be provided. A major pharmaceutical distribution 3PL company in Iran is considered as a practical application of the model to validate and solve it. Numerical results reveal the relation between product perishability and disruption of the storing facilities and the 3PL policy in distribution, storage, back-ordering, and fortification.}

To achieve these positive impacts, the design of Urban-Factories requires studying other extra aspects, such as urban services and logistics. However, the logistics aspect of Urban-Factories is mostly studied when the decisions regarding other design aspects are already made. Yet, overlooking logistics (or any other aspect) in early stages might lead to losing good design solutions, potentially negatively affecting lifetime performance of Urban-Factories.

From 1994 to 2014 the mean distance between groupage networks and their respective barycentres increased by 34%. While the number of locations <10 km from Berlin city centre decreased significantly, the number of locations over 10 km from the city centre but under 30 km away increased. The main reasons found for the relocation of the logistics hubs that were analysed were a lack of large expanses of industrial land in Berlin, and the quest for good infrastructure connections to motorways and federal highways.}

abstract = {Emerging markets have witnessed the logistics volume surge along with economic growth, which also brings environmental issues such as packaging waste. Therefore, many responsible logistics service providers (LSPs) are observed to put efforts in developing sustainable logistics. Such efforts improve the LSP’s brand image to expand the market potential, and benefit the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) who use the LSP’s logistics service. In this paper, we consider an OEM and a LSP’s preferred outsourcing structures by incorporating the LSP’s sustainable efforts and the competition with the OEM when it has the self-branded business. The introduction of sustainable efforts alter the LSP’s cost structure, and eventually, the supply chain parties’ preferences over the OEM’s procurement outsourcing. For the OEM, the bundled outsourcing (outsourcing both procurement and logistics functions to the LSP) does not necessarily yield a lower procurement cost than only outsourcing the logistics, because the LSP possesses sufficient service pricing flexibility. Interestingly, the LSP prefers the OEM’s bundled outsourcing when the OEM’s brand image advantage is either not significant or very significant. The driving force is the tradeoff between the profits from product sales and outsourcing services. Lastly, we compare the environmental performances under alternative outsourcing structures, showing the simultaneous improvement of the OEM’s profits, the LSP’s profits, and the environmental performance is achievable when the OEM outsources the bundled functions of procurement and logistics.}

This article studies hundreds of kilometers of roads and paths that the Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces built -or helped build- in order to understand the logic of rebel mobility and logistics, and to shed light on how rebels see and intervene a territory in the context of a prolonged asymmetrical conflict. Departing from the tradition that sees infrastructure as a univocal tool of state power, this article supports recent scholarship in stressing that infrastructure is a means to the creation of political orders used not only by states but also by insurgent actors. Yet given that the FARC did not only use the infrastructure built by others, but also actively built and sponsored it, the case offers a unique opportunity to observe how the logistic needs of such insurgency shapes a distinctive geography and materiality of transportation. We argue that the organizational development, the strategic goals, and the tactical innovation of the FARC forced the rebel group to find methods of long-distance transportation. This was achieved through two innovations: the mobility corridors and the situation maps. These in turn resulted in an infrastructure network that had the following characteristics: 1) it was web-like instead of hierarchical, 2) it connected peripheral areas from within rather than following a center-periphery logic, 3) it was often short-lived instead of permanent, 4) it was irregular instead of straight, and finally, 5) it emerged after territorial control was secured and not before. We find that the infrastructural project of the rebel group had the dual effect of making the territory more legible and penetrable for the insurgents, while also making it more hostile and opaque for the state.}

The cargo bike, once a common mode of transport, played a minor role in the last decades of motorization. However, the cargo bike is perfectly suited for inner-city transportation. It is quiet, emission-free, and less disturbing for the citizens. However, it is necessary to take the differences with conventional trucks or vans into account. In this chapter we will show different ways of using cargo bikes for freight transportation in inner-city areas and present different scenarios for the efficient use of cargo bikes. In the simplest case the optimization problem corresponds to a shortest path problem. Otherwise, the optimization problems can be either one-echelon or two-echelon. The first type corresponds to a vehicle routing problem (VRP), while the latter one results in a two-echelon VRP (2E-VRP). These are the most common types, but also systems with more than two echelons can be observed. In the 2E-VRP, freight is transported from the depot(s) to rendezvous points, so-called satellite facilities, from which it is transported in the second echelon to the final customers. The 2E-VRP can either incorporate synchronization constraints between the first and second echelons depending on whether the possibility of intermediate storage at the satellites is given or not. Other distinguishing factors are the number of depots, heterogeneous or homogeneous fleets, time window constraints, etc. The problems can be either deterministic or stochastic in nature and might refer to a static or dynamic environment. We will describe the resulting optimization problems in detail and present the relevant literature and state-of-the-art solution methods. Finally, we will describe some applications of the successful use of cargo bikes in European cities like, for example, Heavy Pedals and DPD in Vienna, Haijtas Pajtas in Budapest, and By-Expressen in Copenhagen.}

abstract = {Motivated by the wide utilization of cold-chain service outsourcing, this paper examines the effect of outsourcing mode on decisions and profits by developing game-theoretic models for a fresh agri-product supply chain consisting of one supplier, one retailer, and one third-party logistics provider. There are two service outsourcing modes: supplier-outsourcing and retailer-outsourcing. Supplier (retailer)-outsourcing represents that the supplier (retailer) outsources cold-chain service to the logistics provider. When the supplier is the leader, we find that: (i) under traditional quantity discount scheme, the retailer prefers retailer-outsourcing if both service cost and market size are low, or service cost is high. Otherwise, supplier-outsourcing is better if service cost is low and market size is high. How the supplier prefers outsourcing mode is similar to the retailer. Therefore, there may exist an outsourcing mode preferred by both the supplier and the retailer. (ii) Retailer-outsourcing is more profitable to the logistics provider than supplier-outsourcing. (iii) Service level-dependent quantity discount is an important factor determining which outsourcing mode is beneficial to the retailer and the logistics provider. Further, we consider an alternative case in which the retailer is the leader, and we uncover the conditions under which an outsourcing mode outperforms the other. Comparing the two cases, we find that the decision sequence between the supplier and the retailer is important for which outsourcing mode is beneficial to supply chain members.}

Among many exciting applications to be enabled by 5G, logistics tasks in industry parks can be performed more efficiently via vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications. In this paper, a multi-layer collaboration framework enabled by V2X is proposed for logistics management in industrial parks. The proposed framework includes three layers: a perception and execution layer, a logistics layer, and a configuration layer. In addition to the collaboration among these three layers, this study addresses the collaboration among devices, edge servers, and cloud services. For effective logistics in industrial parks, task collaboration is achieved through four functions: environmental perception and map construction, task allocation, path planning, and vehicle movement. To dynamically coordinate these functions, device–edge–cloud collaboration, which is supported by 5G slices and V2X communication technology, is applied. Then, the analytical target cascading method is adopted to configure and evaluate the collaboration schemes of industrial parks. Finally, a logistics analytical case study in industrial parks is employed to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed collaboration framework.}

In this paper, based on the theory of automated negotiation, a Dynamic Organization Model (DOM) was designed for an online E-commerce Platform (EP) from the perspective of companies outsourcing logistics. During the negotiation, the involved 3PL provider agents may autonomously make decisions upon both the negotiation context and the dynamic market arguments in an iterative manner, and both the basic attributes of 3PL providers and the historical cooperation data with them are considered. Through comprehensive evaluation and negotiation, the most suitable 3PL provider may be determined as the contractual partner. Finally, the effectiveness of DOM is testified by a case study instantiated with a coal company and several 3PL providers.}

The purpose of transshipments is to rebalance stocks across the retail network to better match supply with demand. We formulate this problem as a large mixed integer linear program and develop a Lagrangian relaxation with a primal–dual approach to find upper bounds and a simulated annealing based metaheuristic to find promising solutions, both of which have proven to be quite effective. While our metaheuristic does not always produce better solutions than a commercial optimizer, it has consistently produced solutions with optimality gaps lower than 7% while the commercial optimizer may produce very poor solutions with optimality gaps as high as almost 300%. We have also conducted a set of numerical experiments to uncover implications of various operational practices of LC Waikiki on its system’s performance and important managerial insights.}

However, they also bring operational complexity, with rebalancing bikes being a very challenging one. The importance and difficulty of building the reverse logistics for BSSs are evident from the data obtained from Mobike, one of the largest dockless bike-sharing platforms in China. This paper proposes an evolutionary game theoretic approach to identify the best bike-sharing sourcing strategies, including self-operation, joint venture, and outsourcing. We show that the self-operation mode is an evolutionary stable strategy to rebalance Mobike. However, if bike-sharing firms cannot achieve economies of scale and significantly reduce the variable costs of the self-operation mode, the outsourcing mode will become the optimal choice. From a long-term perspective, the joint venture mode is never an attractive strategy for the bike-sharing firms under study. Our model can select the optimal sourcing strategy to rebalance bikes in BSS to maximize profit when competition and cooperation are jointly considered.}

We make use of an extensive database of 2888 DCs in the Netherlands to develop a new typology of DCs based on the geographical location of DCs, their functional attributes and client sector characteristics. The analysis shows that the context in which medium sized DCs are operating is more heterogeneous than in the case of very large and small size DCs. This study is a first attempt to analyse this relationship between facility size and functions based on a rich and extensive dataset of large population of DCs. The results can serve as input for further quantitative statistical analysis and international comparison.}

Therefore, it becomes necessary for logistics companies to find high-performance strategies to enhance their sustainability. Collaboration between companies appears as one of the promising solution that improves the freight transport efficiency of modern cities. Existing studies on collaborative transport did not sufficiently account for sustainability aspects and they mainly discuss the independent planning of decision-making problems with economic objectives. However, collaboration an integrated decision-making process can significantly ameliorate the effectiveness of urban transportation systems. This study addresses the issue of sustainable freight transportation planning by formulating and solving a collaborative and integrated two-echelon inventory, location and routing problem (2E-CILRP). The 2E-CILRP is formulated as a multi-objective integer programming model that minimizes logistics costs, CO2 emissions and accident rate. A hybrid heuristic based on machine learning is also introduced to solve the studied problem. The proposed approach combines k-means clustering and genetic algorithms. Comparison of the obtained results with those provided with exact method reveals that the developed approach is more efficient and more practical for designing integrated and collaborative networks with large-sized data. A case study of four agri-food SMEs in France is investigated in order to demonstrate the sustainable benefits of the developed optimization approach. The obtained results suggest that the developed approach can significantly reduce the level of CO2 emissions, logistics costs and accident rate caused by transportation in cities.}

We focus on empty container yards, which, while ubiquitous in worldwide logistics, have rarely been studied in the literature, as most prior research has addressed container movements in ports. We build on the few models available in the literature by: (1) expanding the assumed material handling equipment type (we consider three of the most common types used in practice); and (2) allowing for container arrivals during the retrieval process. These aspects are rarely considered but are particularly relevant for empty container depot practices. We show the effect of various yard configurations and material handling equipment types on the probability distribution of the number of relocations. Our approach can also consider time periods of imbalance by assuming an arrival rate greater than or less than the retrieval rate. The results of these models can be used in planning yard layouts, selecting material handling equipment, and determining staffing and overtime levels. Specifically, container relocations during retrievals directly contribute to operational costs, and so accurate models estimating those are required for any planning purposes. While we focus on empty container yards, the models can be applicable to port side container areas as well, particularly ones in developing countries where overhead yard cranes are not employed as often. Therefore, this paper contributes to both the literature and the practice of container depots.}

First, we calculate the minimum cost of the supply chain network design in Fourth Party Logistics when the demand of customers is fully satisfied. In the shortage of investment in the process of supply chain network design, the demand of customers can be partially satisfied. Then, customer psychological behavior is considered to maximize the value function of customer satisfaction under cost constraint. After introducing the definitions of the psychological reference point and the service level for customers based on the prospect theory, we formulate a non-linear integer programming model for Fourth Party Logistics network design problem. Since the objective function of the proposed model is non-linear, an approximation linearization method is introduced to adjust the proposed model to be an equivalent linear model. Numerical experiments are designed to justify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Through a thorough analysis on customer psychological behavior, it can be seen that customers tend to be more risk-averse for gains than risk-seeking for losses in Fourth Party Logistics supply chain network design. Moreover, valuable investment insights are recapitulated. This proposed method provides an effective tool for a Fourth Party Logistics provider to give reasonable suggestions to an investor in Fourth Party Logistics supply chain network design. Furthermore, we extend the basic model of 4PL supply chain network design considering customer satisfaction with multiple commodities and provid a solution method based on greedy adding heuristic to further reduce the calculation time for large scale cases.}

abstract = {The private sector is widely regarded as a useful element in the emergency response to disasters. Humanitarian organizations tend to cooperate with the private sector to deliver aids to affected areas and mitigate the complexity of disasters. In this paper, we propose an efficient relief chain consisting of a humanitarian organization (HO) and third-party logistics providers (3PLPs) to tackle the issue of decentralized planning and decision-making in humanitarian logistics. The relief chain is expected to benefit both the HO and the 3PLPs. To this end, we developed a novel bi-level two-stage multi-objective stochastic programming model. The robust equivalent of the proposed model is also developed to cope with uncertainty. A Benders decomposition algorithm is tailored to solve large-scale problems. An actual earthquake is investigated as case-study to test the model's real-world applicability. Finally, a number of managerial insights are inferred by analyzing the findings of this research.}

abstract = {Neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnets are the most powerful magnets per unit volume sold in the commercial market. Despite the increasing demand for clean energy applications such as electric vehicles and wind turbines, disruptive events including the COVID-19 pandemic have caused significant uncertainties in the supply and demand for NdFeB magnets. Therefore, this study aims to alleviate the risk of supply shortage for NdFeB magnets and the containing critical materials, rare-earth elements (REEs), through the development of a resilient reverse supply chain and logistics network design. We develop scenarios to model the unique impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the proposed business, incorporating both disruption intensity and recovery rate. We formulate a chance-constrained two-stage stochastic programming model to maximize the profit while guaranteeing the network resiliency against disruption risks. To solve the problem in large-scale instances, we develop an efficient Benders decomposition algorithm that reduces the computational time by 98.5% on average compared to the default CPLEX algorithm. When applied to the United States, the model suggests the optimal facility locations, processing capacities, inventory levels, and material flows for NdFeB magnet recyclers that could meet 99.7% of the demand. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to incorporate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic to design a resilient NdFeB magnet recycling supply chain and logistics network, leveraging risk-averse stochastic programming.}

abstract = {This paper proposes a Blockchain based conceptual framework that offers a solution for fundamental barriers of the Physical Internet concerning the exchange of value and physical assets in logistics networks and decentralized leadership structures. In recent years, the Physical Internet has received high interest by researchers and practitioners alike, as it aims for a paradigm shift towards economically, environmentally, and socially sustainable logistics. However, the implementation requires transformations in infrastructure, technology, and business models, which cannot be met by centralized solutions proposed by the literature. Therefore, this paper provides a decentralized approach based on Blockchain technology describing in detail the configuration of the Blockchain and the integration into the distributed network structures of the Physical Internet. Grounded on an industry case study and literature on the Physical Internet and Blockchain, a four-layered framework is derived and subsequently presented in form of an application use case, guiding researchers for further analysis and practitioners for adoption opportunities.}

abstract = {Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) plays an important part in the economic growth of developing Asia and logistics capability is a crucial factor in FDI location choice. Till today, research investigating Logistics Performance (LP) and FDI in Asia are still lacking and rather inconclusive and not standardised. Using a total of 31 Asian countries covering 2007 through 2017, the study critically investigates the impact of LP on FDI using static panel regression method. The results demonstrate that while LP significantly impact FDI, there is a threshold effect of institutional quality in the LP-FDI relationship. Specifically, this paper found that the impact of LP on FDI varies across the perceived level of institutional quality i.e., the effect is positive only before certain threshold level of institutional quality, after which the effect of LP on FDI is reversed. This finding suggests that the LP-FDI nexus is contingent on the perceived level of institutional quality, thus supporting the idea that innovations (i.e., creativity and flexibility embedded within a sound institutional framework) is potent in delivering long-run LP-FDI development in Asia.}
