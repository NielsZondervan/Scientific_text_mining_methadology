abstract = {As energy overuse and generated pollution have a potential threat to our environmental and ecological conditions, many researchers have taken the initiative way to join the green campaign to prevent more damage to the environment. This paper investigates the main contributions related to the green vehicle routing problem (Green-VRP) and presents a classification scheme based on its variants considered in scientific literature, in particular, three major and applicable streams including internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs), alternative-fuel powered vehicles (AFVs), and hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), and also several sub-categories for each of them. This systematic literature review intends to provide a comprehensive and structured survey of the state of knowledge and discuss the most important characteristics of the problems, including techniques of formulation, solution methodologies, and areas of application. This paper presents different analytical summary tables for each variant to emphasize some main features that provide the direction of the development of researches. Finally, to spot future avenues, gaps in the literature are distinguished to illustrate how new contributions are different from traditional problems.}

Many of them consist in designing routes for vehicles to move commodities between locations. This article approaches a pickup-and-delivery single-vehicle routing problem where there is susceptibility to uncertainty in customer requests. The probability distributions of the requests are assumed to be known, and the objective is to design an a priori route with minimum expected length. The problem has already been approached in the literature, but through a heuristic method. This article proposes the first exact approach to the problem. Two mathematical formulations are proposed: one is a compact model (i.e. defined by a polynomial number of variables and constraints); the other one contains an exponential number of inequalities and is solved within a branch-and-cut framework. Computational results show the upsides as well as the breakdowns of both formulations.}

Operators of stand-on electric pallet trucks are subjected to severe vibration on their suspended platform. Measurements in companies have shown that coming in and out of a semi-trailer when crossing a dock leveller are the most critical operations in terms of shocks and vibration. This is mainly due to floor irregularities at the loading dock area. Moreover, no standardized test code exists to assess the irregularity roughness either at the dock leveller design stage or when installed in a company. This study had dual objectives. The first was to reduce the whole-body vibration exposure of workers during truck loading or unloading. The second objective was to develop a test protocol to assess the unevenness/roughness encountered along the route, mostly around the loading dock area. In partnership with a logistics company, the operator’s activity and different loading dock areas were studied and the daily vibration exposure of drivers was calculated. Consequently, the driving habits of the drivers were changed, the surface state and uses of dock levellers were modified and the irregularities encountered, mainly at the boundary between the dock leveller and semitrailer, were treated. The reducing of daily vibration exposure by between 30% and 50% was possible with simple solutions.}

UAVs are widely used through different phases of construction, from aerial mapping, safety and quality monitoring and site logistics to structural inspection and maintenance assessment. While there is significant research about the benefits of UAVs for specific construction-related tasks, there is a dearth of research examining the impact of working with or near UAVs on the health and safety of workers. In this theory-driven paper, we examined UAV integration in construction workplaces from a health and safety perspective, categorized the potential ways UAVs might affect the construction workers’ health and safety, and provided a roadmap for future research in this area. The study used inferential and VR visualization techniques to identify the risks posed by UAVs, which were categorized into three groups of (1) physical risks, (2) attentional costs, and (3) psychological impacts. We then proposed a concurrent and cross-functional two-branch research road map to advance our knowledge about human-UAV interactions and develop regulatory and technological measures to ensure safe integration of UAVs in construction. The first branch shall empirically evaluate different ways UAVs can adversely impact workers’ health and safety. The second branch shall use these findings to develop regulatory and administrative interventions to guide the UAVs’ safe operation on construction sites and develop innovative hardware and software components for future UAVs to ensure their safe co-operation with human workers.}

To compare mealtime behaviors and diet quality in Chinese preschoolers with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and typically developing preschoolers in Hong Kong.
Study design
This case–control study included a community sample of 65 families with preschoolers with ASD aged 3-6 years and 65 families with typically developing preschoolers matched for age and sex. Preschoolers' eating behaviors were assessed using the Brief Autism Mealtime Behaviour Inventory and the Preschoolers' Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (CPEBQ). Preschoolers’ usual diet and nutrient intake were assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire. Diet quality and diversity were generated using the Chinese Children Dietary Index total score and diet variety score. Between-group differences in various scales and dietary variables were examined using multivariate linear or logistics regression models adjusting for baseline demographic differences.
Results
Compared with the typically developing group, the ASD group had greater scores in the Brief Autism Mealtime Behaviour Inventory food refusal domain (P < .001), the CPEBQ food fussiness (P = .001) and eating habit (P = .001) domains, and lower CPEBQ exogenous eating score (P = .003) and initiative eating score (P < .001). The Chinese Children Dietary Index total score (P = .001) and diet variety score (P = .005) and intake of soy and soy products (P = .001) were lower in the ASD group compared with the typically developing group.
Conclusions
Preschoolers with ASD showed more eating and mealtime problems, and lower diet quality and diversity than their typically developing counterparts. Our findings highlight the need for regular monitor and early identification of mealtime behavioral and nutrition problems among preschoolers with ASD.}

Such systems are first illustrated by the Lotka–Volterra predator–prey model, which can lead to oscillatory reactions. Next, this model is adapted to describe the competition between two species (e.g., rabbits and sheep) and show that most often when two species compete for the same resources, one drives the other to extinction. A parallel is drawn with the extinction of Neanderthals when the Home sapiens sapiens arrived in Europe. The sensitivity of non-linear systems to the initial conditions can lead to chaos. This is illustrated with a discrete-time analogue of the logistics equation and with the Lorenz equations describing convection in the atmosphere. The occurrence of oscillations in chemical systems is illustrated with the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction. Models describing oscillatory reactions include the Brusselator, the Oregonator and the Coimbrator. This latter model shows that chemical oscillators can occur in a closed system at constant pressure and temperature provided that photochemical reactions can occur. This is illustrated by Earth as a closed system, where photosynthesis may provide the driving force for oscillations that have an impact in climate.}

A total of 23,099 children under the age of five were included in this analysis. Chi-square analysis was conducted to assess the association between outcome variables and selected covariates. At the same time, this study uses two separate multivariate binary logistics regression models (respectively for urban areas and rural areas) to determine the risk factors that are primarily related to child development. Our research estimates that more than 70 percent of children develop early throughout the country. The multivariate analysis on the determinants of child development index among children aged between 36 and 59 months old regarding residence discovered a significant impact on child age and sex, maternal education, child education, wealth status, reading children's books. The adjusted odds of child nutrition status, playthings, and maternal functional difficulties have had a major impact on early child development in rural Bangladesh. Based on the findings, educational status, nutritional status, wealth-status, and some determinants of children care the most noteworthy findings in this study. Hence, policymakers should emphasize on such factors for improving children's development in residence.}

abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) network is widely used in environmental monitoring, target searching and rescuing, logistics, and other fields due to its characteristics of large-scale coverage, rapid deployment and strong resistance to destruction. When users are interested in sensory data in certain areas covered by UAV networks, they can send a spatio-temporal range query with time and geography constraints through the ground station. For example, obtaining the temperature information around fire points in the forest within an hour before the fire bursts out. Then, UAVs that carry the query results will return the data to the ground station through multi-hop routing. However, most of the existing spatio-temporal range query algorithms are designed for static networks. How to conduct spatio-temporal range queries in the UAV networks is still an open problem. In this paper, we propose a Trajectory-Aware Spatio-Temporal range query processing algorithm (TAST) for UAV networks. The ground station takes advantage of the pre-planned trajectory information of UAVs to build the topology change model of the UAV network, which can reflect the changes of UAVs’ communication links and neighbors. Furthermore, the static topology change graph (TCG) is proposed for optimizing the routing of query results in the spatio-temporal query processing. Next, we propose a Trajectory-Aware Spatio-Temporal range query processing algorithm based on packet Splitting (TASTS), which is used to split large query results into multiple small packets called unit packets, and each unit packet is transmitted back to the ground station independently and efficiently. Finally, we evaluated our algorithms through simulation experiments. The simulation results show that TAST and TASTS perform well in terms of query success rate, query efficiency and overhead ratio.}

However, OO languages are not particularly suited for the implementation of software which involves solving complicated search problems with dynamically appearing constraints, e. g. as found in logistics. Aiming to improve this situation, we propose the Münster Logic-imperative Language (Muli). As a constraint-logic OO language, it facilitates an integrated implementation of applications that use aspects from both constraint-logic and object-oriented programming, thus eliminating the need to resort to JNI for the integration of search applications that are written in a (constraint) logic language. Muli extends Java by logic variables and encapsulated search. Its runtime is based on a symbolic Java virtual machine and leverages constraint solvers. Outside of search regions, Muli behaves just like Java. We motivate the benefits of integrating object-oriented programming and constraint-logic programming into a single language and introduce novel concepts that are required for a seamless integration. Furthermore, we present an operational semantics and transfer concepts and semantics into implementations of a compiler and a virtual machine.}

abstract = {Purpose
First developed in Canada in the 1990s, Rapid Access Palliative Radiation Therapy (RAPRT) clinics have subsequently spread internationally to expedite treatment for near end-of-life patients, sparing them the need for multiple visits to the department. A “classical” RAPRT clinic is herein defined as “a dedicated clinic specifically established to enable (ideally) same day consultation, planning for, and delivery of palliative radiation treatment.” The aim of this work was to determine the current status of these clinics in Australia and New Zealand (ANZ).
Methods and Materials
A phone survey of all 100 Australian and 10 NZ radiation therapy centers was conducted in March and April 2021. The Chief Medical Officers of the 2 large private practices (GenesisCare and Icon) also approved the survey and answered on behalf of their 57 centers. A single page questionnaire was used, seeking information on the logistics and clinical details of past and present RAPRT clinics, and reasons why other centers do not have one.
Results
The survey response rate was 100%. There are only 3 current RAPRT clinics (2.7%). The dominant treatment indication is bone metastases (85%-90%), with most patients receiving single fractions (60%-90%), but commencement on the same day is variable (35%-90%). Five other clinics (4.5%) closed after 4 months to 7 years, but the clinical features were similar. By far, the most common reason (95%) given by the 107 centers without a current RAPRT clinic was that these patients are accommodated using existing resources.
Conclusions
Classical RAPRT clinics have not been widely embraced in ANZ. There are alternative strategies such as the Advanced Practice Radiation Therapist model and techniques to avoid the conventional computed tomography–simulation step, which may also expedite treatment for palliative patients.}

In many cases, it is much more flexible for experts to provide evaluation information via pairwise comparisons rather than give their evaluation information on options directly. In this regard, the hesitant fuzzy linguistic preference relation (HFLPR) whose elements are hesitant fuzzy linguistic elements was introduced. Besides, to make a reasonable decision, a group of experts are usually involved in practice and thus how to reach an agreement among experts whose perceptions are represented by HFLPRs turns to be significantly important. To meet this challenge, in this study, we propose a novel consensus measure for group decision making with HFLPRs. Firstly, we define an alpha-cut-based method to calculate the similarities among different hesitant fuzzy linguistic evaluations and then develop an alpha-cut-based consensus measure for group decision making with HFLPRs. By converting the linguistic terms of hesitant fuzzy linguistic elements into numerical values of 0 or 1, the consensus measure can be simplified. Finally, to illustrate the effectiveness of the method, we apply it to a practical case study. A comparative analysis is provided to demonstrate the advantages and significance in practical applications of the proposed method.}

This study aimed to report our initial experience with weekly tele-video “virtual” on-treatment visits (vOTVs), describe the logistics of implementation, report the results of patient and physician surveys, and discuss the barriers, limitations, and benefits of vOTVs during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Methods and materials
vOTVs were piloted at 2 centers and within 1 week were expanded to 4 additional centers. Patients participating in vOTVs were surveyed about their satisfaction with vOTVs, the quality of vOTVs, and confidence in their physician’s ability to manage their care through vOTVs, as well as their support of and preferences related to vOTVs. Participating physicians were surveyed about their comfort and satisfaction with vOTVs. Medical directors at nonparticipating centers within our network were surveyed regarding their reasoning for not using vOTVs.
Results
In week 1, 72 of 81 patients between 2 pilot centers were seen using vOTVs. In week 2, 189 of 211 patients were seen using vOTVs at 6 centers. Patient satisfaction with and confidence in their physician’s ability to address their concerns through the vOTV was high at 4.75 on a 5-point scale. Patients were overall very supportive (4.67) and found the quality of the visits to be as good as or better than their prior in-person weekly on-treatment visit (3.75). Physicians participating in the vOTVs felt very comfortable in their ability to manage patients through this platform (5.0) and on average did not report any difference in terms of efficiency of visits (3.0).
Conclusions
vOTVs were easy to implement and well received by patients and participating physicians. Our experience suggests that vOTVs can be implemented rapidly using available technology and with a high degree of patient and physician satisfaction during this pandemic with similar efficiency to in-person on-treatment visits.}

PI can be considered as the interconnection of logistics networks via open PI-hubs, in which there are plenty of requests to be transported. These requests continuously arrive at different auction periods with various quantity. Carriers can bid for these requests through participating several rounds of auction. In a dynamic environment, a major problem for the carrier is how to decide the bidding price to maximize his profit. Besides, to make better decision, when determining the bidding price in current period, carrier should forecast the possible requests in next periods, especially facing with peak/off-peak time periods. This paper proposes a dynamic pricing model considering the forecasted quantity of requests in the next auction periods to optimize the bidding price and maximize the total profit. A numerical study is conducted to evaluate the model and study how the future requests influence the current pricing decision, including the influence to the bidding price and profit.}

abstract = {Overall allocation of space station on-orbit activities is the process of allocating a set of on-orbit activities to be executed on the space station in a long-term planning period into several short-term subperiods while balancing logistics demand, resource requirement and the execution priority of on-orbit activities. The basic mathematical model is firstly formulated. Then a heuristic allocation strategy is proposed to reduce optimization difficulty and a hybrid decision-making approach combining physical programming and evolutionary computation is developed to directly search a Pareto-optimal solution, and the performance of these methods in addressing the problem is compared with that of NSGA-III. Three test case with 500, 1000 and 2000 on-orbit activities respectively are simulated to demonstrate the proposed approaches. The results show that the heuristic allocation strategy is effective and performs better than only applying meta-heuristics, and the decision-making approach based on physical programming can efficiently achieve a decision-maker-preferred solution that is converged better than the Pareto frontier obtained by NSGA-III. The obtained allocation scheme satisfies all equilibrium indexes and constraints.}

This disease is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The only available tools to avoid contamination and transmission of this virus are physical distancing, the use of N95 and surgical masks, and hand hygiene. Vaccines are another essential tool to reduce the impact of the pandemic, though these present challenges in terms of production and logistics, particularly in underdeveloped and developing countries. One of the critical early research findings is the interaction of the spike virus protein with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) human receptor. Developing strategies to block this interaction has therefore been identified as a way to treat this infection. Neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) have emerged as a therapeutic approach since the pandemic started. Infected patients may be asymptomatic or present with mild symptoms, and others may evolve to moderate or severe disease, leading to death. An immunological phenomenon known as cytokine storm has been observed in patients with severe disease characterized by a proinflammatory cytokine cascade response that leads to lung injury. Thus, some treatment strategies focus on anti-cytokine storm nAbs. This review summarizes the latest advances in research and clinical trials, challenges, and perspectives on antibody-based treatments (ABT) as therapies against COVID-19.}

Generally, these geothermal energy systems are expected to primarily produce heat and power in one plant and provide various benefits related to the efficiency, system, operational logistics, environment, and economy benefits. The exergy method is utilized in designing and analyzing the geothermal energy–based power production technologies because it provides powerful tools for analyzing, assessing, designing, improving, and optimizing geothermal energy systems and processes. Also, in this chapter, the examples and case studies are presented for basic geothermal energy systems, illustrating that results obtained through exergetic analysis of basic geothermal energy systems are clearer and more meaningful than those obtained by energetic analysis and help indicate potential modifications to increase performance.}

It contends that such a unique form of “living at work”, as illustrated by African mining compounds and Chinese workers’ dorms, represents a fluid assemblage of processes and relationships at transnational, national, and local scales. An empirical case study on one Chinese infrastructure construction project in Ethiopia highlights how Chinese CLR in Africa is co-produced by the established industrial practices in China, the regulatory contexts of the host African country, and the situated strategies of expatriate and local workers. Specifically, the seemingly integrated CLR is internally fragmented due to the use of subcontractors and outsourced labor – two prevalent practices in China’s construction sector – as well as the employment of both expatriate and local workers. This fragmentation is inscribed in the spatial configuration of the compound and reflected by the varied managerial mentalities and strategies, which lead to two sub-regimes of management-labor relations: negotiated despotism upon expatriate workers and cautious precarity upon local recruits. Expatriate workers are subject to socio-spatial immobility, overtime work, delayed payment, and substandard logistics; but they can negotiate conditions of work based on their socio-technical positions. Local workers, despite the lack of job security and work-related benefits, enjoy some institutional protection and intra-group solidarity. The multiple forms of strength and weakness experienced by workers underline the importance to nuance the complexity and contradictions of Chinese investment in Africa.}

Traditional treatment methods are not attractive in the long-term due to management requirement, energy input and operational logistics and passive approaches offer an alternative approach. Constructed wetlands are widely cited as a potential treatment option but there is limited data on long term field-scale applications. Treatment of alkaline residue leachate was assessed over a 52 month period and showed effective pH reductions from ca. pH 11.2 (inflow) to 7.2 (outflow). Trace element content measured during the 4th year of operation demonstrated effective reduction in trace element (Al 17,256 μg/l to 330 μg/l; V 140 μg/l to 13 μg/l) with no evidence of toxicity in test species Vibrio fischeri, Skeletonema costatum, Tisbe battagliai and Oncorhynchus mykiss in the wetland outflow. Sediment analysis found some increases in trace element content but no evidence of accumulation in Phragmites was found in vegetation sampling. Longevity and management requirements for constructed wetland treating alkaline bauxite residue leachate are more likely to be impacted from increases in soil Na and pH. Increases are more evident in front sections of wetland but it is proposed that loading to wetlands can be decreased by incorporation of other passive technologies within the overall treatment approach and by feeding different sections of the wetlands on a cyclical basis.}

Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play an important role in T cells. CC chemokine receptor 5 is a highly expressed chemokine receptor in T cells. They play an important role in inflammation and immune response of stroke.
Methods
Flow cytometry measured Tregs and CCR5+ Tregs in the blood of patients. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were utilized to analyze the effect of Tregs and CCR5+ Tregs on the prognosis of ischemic stroke. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to assess predictive values for Treg cells and CCR5+ Tregs.
Results
Tregs in patients with severe ischemic stroke were higher than those in mild ischemic stroke (P < 0.05), while the expression of CCR5+ Tregs were reversed (P < 0.05). The results of univariate and multivariate logistics regression analysis showed that Tregs and CCR5+ Tregs had a good predictive effect on the prognosis of ischemic stroke. The ROC curve demonstrated that the combination of Tregs and CCR+ Tregs achieved a better prediction effect (AUC = 0.758; P < 0.001).
Conclusions
The combination of Tregs and CCR5+ Tregs can be used as biomarkers for the prognosis of ischemic stroke.}

However, it also serves as a source of raw material for the manufacturing of high-quality cosmetic and pharmaceutical products. Due to its high demand, cocoa is regarded as a major commodity for poverty alleviation in deprived cocoa farming communities. Government has therefore instigated relevant measures to address issues facing the sector by investing in extension programs. These programs act as information dissemination tools for teaching modern farming technologies and enhancing learning among farmers. This study highlighted the effects of the Cocoa Life Project (CLP) by Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere (CARE) International on farm productivity and income of 200 cocoa farmers in three districts of the Eastern Region, Ghana. Regression on covariates, Heckman’s treatment effects model, and propensity scores were used to test the robustness of the estimates. A positive association between extension program participation, farm productivity, and household income was discovered. Specifically, after correcting for selection bias, the estimated results of the Heckman’s model showed that the extension program significantly increased participating farmers’ cocoa yield by 14.3%. The effects on total farm income showed a significant increase of 25.1 and 42.9%, respectively from regression on propensity scores and the Heckman’s model. Across all three models, program participation led to an increase in total household income by 46.1, 31.7, and 69.3%, respectively. Other variables such as farming characteristics, institutional and demographic factors affected farmers’ income, depending on the estimation method used. This study reiterated the supporting role played by extension programs in enhancing cocoa production and increasing household income in Ghana. Conclusively, government and development partners should invest in extension programs by providing enough logistics, training qualified agents, and creating a conducive atmosphere to support learning and technology adoption.}

abstract = {With an increase of UAVs in logistics and transportation, the safety of UAVs operated in the urban wind environment becomes an important issue. Small UAVs are more sensitive to the wind environment because of their small size, slow cruising speed, and limited endurance. In the unmanned aircraft system traffic management (UTM), a safety risk assessment under bad weather conditions is an important component. In this study, a hazardous flight region prediction system for small UAVs operated in urban areas is developed using a deep neural network (DNN) to support a risk assessment and safe trajectory planning. A large eddy simulation (LES) is applied to reflect the terrain-driven wind environment in the urban area. The result of a weather research and forecasting (WRF) model is used as an initial and boundary condition of the LES to generate a realistic complicated wind environment in an urban area. Furthermore, an iterative nesting algorithm is applied to the LES to obtain a sufficient resolution of the wind environment, which is suitable for the small UAV scale. The deviation distance from the original flight path due to the wind environment is considered as a flight hazard criterion in this study. The proposed system is able to predict deviation distance due to the wind environment over the entire flight space over time by using the DNN model. The training data for the DNN is obtained using the multicopter flight dynamics simulator, which can take into account the influence of a specific wind environment. With the indexes considering this deviation distance and the local topography (distribution of buildings) in the urban area, the hazardous flight region is predicted. The information supplied by the proposed hazardous flight region prediction model can be used for the flight risk assessment and safe flight trajectory planning to increase the flight safety of small UAVs.}

Four product systems differentiated by feedstocks, logistics and centralized/decentralized fermenters are investigated. For both feedstocks, it is found that a centralized large-scale fermentation is preferable to decentralized small-scale fermentation (25–30% less expensive and 5% lower WTT emissions). Once commercialization is reached, the cost and carbon performance of this novel bio-jet fuel could be similar to that of other alcohol-to-jet fuels. Depending on the feedstock and configuration considered, the GHG emission mitigation potential of this novel jet-fuel was estimated between 41% and 52%.

To accommodate the stochastic battery consumption, a charging strategy comparable to the inventory control policy is proposed. Two policies based on a.) separate decision parameter for each node and b.) a common parameter over the given network, are tested. The vehicle movement is simulated over fixed routes but with stochastic battery consumption over each arc following charging decisions as specified by the given polices. The three parameters i.e. minimum battery level, number of times vehicle is charged and feasibility of route over each simulation are compared for testing the two policies. It is observed that the network-wide fixed parameter give comparable results to the node dependent parameters, using lesser information.}

Our interviews asked participants about dance-based exercise and SSTs for exercise and showed that there is an opportunity to design SSTs to help people access dance-based exercise.

Supply chain experts should integrate sustainability practices in different phases of the supply chain and encourage organizations to orient their efforts toward designing sustainable supply chains. In this study, we present a new metric, “supply chain sustainability index (SCSI)” to assess the overall sustainability of a biomass supply chain network through three criteria: environmental, social, and economic sustainability. To pursue the objective of the study, a Bayesian Network approach is implemented to depict the causal relationship among different variables and to demonstrate a better analysis of the subject. For further assessment and analysis of the overall sustainability of the supply chain network, sensitivity analysis and belief propagation are performed. Results indicate that all three criteria are imperative to SCSI prediction; however, economic sustainability has a slightly higher effect among the three criteria, while social criteria have the lowest effect on SCSI.}

Discrete shipment size choice models are estimated for different homogenous segments formed by latent class analysis. A machine learning technique called Bayesian classifier is applied to link segments obtained from a sample to data of commodity flows being available on a national level. Finally, in an exemplary scenario, the impact of information and communication technologies on shipment size distributions is calculated, revealing moderate elasticities and a predominant substitution of less than truck loads by full truck loads.}

This study aimed to survey the impact of the coronavirus on the poultry supply chain using an exploratory sequential mixed design. We first addressed those stages of the poultry supply chain disrupted in an ongoing pandemic, and then elaborated particular disturbances associated with each stage. This study was based on data collected from Iranian poultry industry owners and experts who had sufficient experience in agricultural supply chains as well. As the qualitative phase, the content analysis was conducted to identify the impacts of the coronavirus on the poultry supply chain. The results and conclusions that emerged from the qualitative phase were refined and weighted by the Fuzzy Delphi Method (FDM) and the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) respectively, in the quantitative phase. The results suggested that the pandemic has further affected the input supply as a stage in the poultry supply chain. This is probably because of the fact that the poultry industry is heavily dependent on inputs' flow. In addition, supply chain governance was seriously impaired due to the persistence of the pandemic. The coronavirus pandemic has significantly affected the stages that are most reliant on transportation. Finally, we found that a part of the disruptions that occur in the downstream of the supply chain is due to the epidemic's direct adverse effects, and another part is due to indirect consequences received from the upstream. Our findings and implications can be useful in decision-making procedures during ongoing epidemics.}

The objective of this project was to evaluate the effect of adjusting the solution reporting phase of problem-based learning (PBL) while keeping core components of the pedagogy constant.
Methods
A PBL course for third year pharmacy students changed delivery of the problem solution from a written format to a verbal defense. Comparisons were made between the written format and verbal defense groups. The primary outcome was the change in the motivation domain of the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ). Secondary outcomes included evaluation of the learning strategies domain of the MSLQ, changes in MSLQ scores within each group, exam scores, and themes identified using focus groups.
Results
There was no difference in the change of motivation and learning domains between the groups. However, scores in both groups increased significantly from the beginning to the end of the semester for both motivation and learning. There was no difference in exam scores and facilitator confidence between groups. Themes from focus groups who used the written format were appreciation of PBL outcomes, discomfort with the pedagogy, and disconnect of assessments. Themes from the verbal format group were realism, increased confidence, and comments with course logistics.
Conclusions
No difference in motivation and learning was observed between the groups, although both groups improved over the course of the semester. Changes to PBL approach within the confines of the pedagogy may not impact motivation and learning.}

This article is the first to study the behavior of unpaced, reliable, and unreliable merging assembly lines that are deliberately unbalanced with respect to their coefficients of variation (CV). Conducting a series of simulation runs with varying line lengths, buffer storage capacities and unbalanced CV patterns delivers intriguing results. For both reliable and unreliable lines, the best pattern for generating higher throughput is found to be a balanced configuration (equal CVs along both parallel lines), except for unreliable lines with a station buffer capacity of six. In that case, the highest throughput results from the descending configuration, i.e. concentrating the variable stations close to the beginning of both parallel lines and the steady stations towards the end of the line. Ordering from the least to most steady station also provides the best average buffer level. By exploring the experimental Pareto Frontier, this study shows the combined performance of unbalanced CV patterns for throughput and average buffer level. Study results suggest that caution should be exercised when assuming equivalent behavior from reliable and unreliable lines, or single serial lines and merging lines, since the relative throughput performance of some CV patterns changed between the different configurations.}

To ensure broad applicability in different mobility scenarios as well as addressing individual mobility needs while offering intuitive operability, we followed an interdisciplinary approach. While the challenge to realize this vision on a technical level was prepared, both logistics and human sciences collaborated in developing data collection instruments and using user-centered development methods. In detail, we used online questionnaires to describe mobility needs on the test field of a university's' campus. Secondly, we used focus groups to discuss points relevant to future users' needs for the autonomous driving cargo bike as well as discussion points with other road users who would encounter the cargo bike in traffic. We integrated results from those different approaches to formulate construction indications and points for future research.}

Here, we report on the launch of an innovative family-centered pediatric medical home for opioid-affected families in Boston. We describe the program, the patient cohort, and early lessons learned. Important themes include the vulnerability of families with infants whose parents are in early recovery, and the need for compassionate, high-touch, high-continuity, team-based care that views the needs of the family as a whole. We recommend a future emphasis on non-stigmatizing, trauma-informed care; centering the needs of the family by addressing social and logistics barriers and by expanding models of parent-child dyadic care; investing in attachment and mental health interventions; developing strategies for prevention of opioid use disorder (OUD) in the next generation; and grounding our advocacy and actions in a social justice approach.}

This problem emanates from logistics related to biogas transportation in which biogas is transported in containers from many suppliers to a single facility. We present a novel and compact formulation for the supply-driven IRP which addresses the routing decisions in continuous-time in which inventory levels within the containers are continuous. Valid inequalities are included and realistic instances are solved to optimality. For all experiments, we found that the total transportation time is minimized when the storage capacity at each supplier is larger than or equal to the vehicle capacity. These routes are characterized by tours in which mostly single suppliers are visited. In 95% of the instances, the average content level of the exchanged containers exceeded 99.6%.}

In the process of classification, the presence of noisy samples in datasets tends to reduce the performance of a classifier. This work proposes a clustering-based Noisy-sample-Removed Under-sampling Scheme (NUS) for imbalanced classification. First, the samples in the minority class are clustered. For each cluster, its center is taken as a spherical center, and the distance of the minority class samples farthest from the cluster center is taken as the radius to form a hypersphere. The Euclidean distance from the center of the cluster to every of the majority samples is calculated to decide if they are in the hypersphere. Then, we propose a NUS-based policy to decide if a majority sample in the hypersphere is a noisy sample. Similarly, the noises samples of the minority class are found. Second, We remove noisy-samples from the majority and minority classes and propose NUS. Finally, logistics regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest are used in NUS as the base classifiers, respectively and compare with Random Under-Sampling (RUS), EasyEnsemble (EE), and Inverse Random Under-Sampling (IRUS) on 13 public datasets. Results show that our method can improve the classification performance in comparison with its state-of-the art peers.}

However, social factors are not often part of the equation when calculating attractiveness scores at an early stage. We claim that social factors should be considered by identifying social thresholds and, furthermore, by including social no-go factors in the screening. This opinion piece draws on early findings from a larger research project on the sustainability of the mineral and metal industry. As part of the project, we have participated in discussions with companies, consultants, and researchers about the existing evaluation criteria generally used on greenfield projects. Based on this exercise, a site evaluation tool for mining companies is presently being developed.

Current treatments for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lung disease have limited efficacy. Low-dose radiation therapy (LDRT) has received both interest and criticism as a potential treatment for this condition. In this qualitative study we explored clinicians’ perspectives to identify barriers to testing LDRT in clinical trials and implementing it in clinical practice.
Methods and Materials
Semistructured interviews were undertaken with 6 clinicians from 3 medical disciplines. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed thematically, using a framework approach. Common themes regarding barriers to using LDRT for COVID-19 lung disease were identified from the data.
Results
Three categories of barriers emerged: (1) the potential to do harm to the patient, including difficulty in predicting harm and lack of existing data to inform quantification of risks; (2) the feasibility of trialing this novel treatment strategy in the clinical setting, in particular trial design and recruitment, patient selection and buy-in from relevant clinician groups; and (3) the logistics of delivering the treatment, in particular risks of transmission to other patients and resources required for patient transfer.
Conclusions
This study identified several barriers that may impede the evaluation and subsequent implementation of LDRT as a treatment for COVID-19 lung disease, from the perspectives of clinicians in 3 relevant specialties. By documenting and articulating these concerns, we hope to enhance discussion of why these barriers exist, and enable them to be addressed in a proactive manner to facilitate research into the potential benefits of radiation treatment for patients with COVID-19 lung disease going forward.}

The study aims to investigate the Low Birth Weight (LBW) of newborn infants among the tribal population in India.
Methods and Materials
Study analyses 1,93,345 tribal children aged 0–5 years from the fourth round of the National Family Health Survey data (NFHS-4, 2015–16). Logistics regression has been performed to investigate the correlates of low birth weight.
Results
Results show that every fifth newborn child among tribal in 165 districts is LBW and total of 232 districts have proportionately higher LBW than the national average (18.2%). Newborns belonging to Scheduled Tribes in Madhya Pradesh (30 districts), Maharashtra (19 districts), Rajasthan (19 districts), Odisha (19 districts), Gujarat (16 districts), Bihar (12 districts), Karnataka (10 districts), West Bengal (9 districts) and Andhra Pradesh (5 districts) – have higher proportion of low birth weight than the national average. Univariate Global Moran's I index shows that 21% of districts have positive auto correlation for the prevalence of LBW among tribals. Mother's age at birth, mother's education, ANC visits and wealth index are important in determining the LBW of a newborn.
Conclusion
The prevalence of LBW is higher among tribal population. Mother's education, wealth index, ANC visits, Mother's age at birth are key determinants that need to be addressed to reduce prevalence of LBW among the tribal population. The government needs to focus on marginalized communities with target based intervention and policies.}

We also identified the advantages associated with an increase in product variety and investigated the relationships between business process performance and degree of customisation. Drawing on value chain and resource-based logic, a product variety increase was found to have a differential impact on business processes and was partly contingent on the levels of customisation offered. The results provide both a better understanding of the implications and relative costs associated with product variety increases on key business processes and activities and highlight key areas of business process capability development in order to mitigate the effects of variety increases. The study also provides an example for researchers on the process and advantages of using mixed methods. The results are valuable for manufacturers considering extending their product range in order to provide more choice for customers.}

Optimizing ventilation design of packaging systems to improve cooling uniformity and reduce energy consumption has been a hot research topic. Inner tray is an important factor contributing to cooling heterogeneity. However, the study about the design optimization of inner tray is rather limited. The present study focused on the influence of inner tray on the precooling process of apples and explored the impact of widening the gap between the tray edge and box wall on airflow distribution and precooling effectiveness. A three-dimensional model was established on the basis of an existing container being widely used in China’s agricultural cold-chain-logistics industry, and the direct computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation method was adopted to study the precooling process. The examined gap width increments were between 0 and 0.015 m. Results indicated that properly widening the gap was an effective way to achieve the goal of enhancing precooling effectiveness, without changing the design configuration parameters of the box. For the selected two-layer package, the optimal increment of the gap width was about 0.010 m, with which the cooling time could be reduced by 18.8 %, the cooling uniformity could be increased by 16.0 %, and the energy consumption could be reduced by 21.6 % simultaneously.}

The proposed system admits triangularly tessellated surface (STL) models as inputs and outputs machining process labels (e.g. milling, turning etc.) as the results of classification of the neural network. Computer-synthesized workpiece models are utilized in training the neural network. In addition to the MPI system, a portable framework was developed for future applications in related fields. The MPI system shows more than 98% accuracy for both synthesized models and real workpiece models which verifies its robustness and real-time reliability.}

With the rapid development of mobile Internet, smartphones have become an important device for consumers to publish OCRs. Information input is more difficult on smartphones than on PCs because of the screen size, the convenience of using keyboard and the interference of use situation. Based on cognitive cost theory, this study compares the differences of the statistical characteristics of OCRs (study 1) and the narrative content of OCRs (study 2) submitted via smartphones and PCs about material purchases in B2C websites. In study 1, an analysis of 24,933 OCRs across six products shows that OCRs submitted via smartphones have fewer words, more images, higher star rating, and shorter time interval than via PCs. In study 2, by coding and analyzing 1001 OCRs, the results show that OCRs submitted via smartphones are less likely to mention price, product functionality, product quality, product aesthetics, service quality, logistics quality, and attitudinal loyalty than via PCs, whereas no significant difference is observed in the dimensions of seller trustworthiness, cognitive attitude, emotional attitude, and recommendation expression. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.}

abstract = {Purpose
Gender-affirming treatment for transgender and nonbinary adolescents has been shown to decrease anxiety, depression, and suicidality, but treatments have medical consequences. Specifically, hormone replacement and pubertal blocking may impact patients' fertility and childbearing capabilities. We interviewed gender diverse adolescents regarding their thoughts on family and fertility.
Methods
We completed semistructured interviews with 23 gender diverse adolescents recruited from the Seattle Children's Gender Clinic. Interviewees included transfeminine, transmasculine, and nonbinary youth. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using Braun and Clarke's theory of thematic analysis, a flexible framework for qualitative analysis.
Results
Gender diverse adolescents have myriad views on fertility, but four main themes were identified: (1) an interest in future family, including ideas regarding adoption and biological children; (2) barriers to fertility, including cost and procedure-related dysphoria; (3) factors unique to the developmental stage of adolescents, including the age discordance of making fertility decisions as a teenager and parental influence on decision-making; and (4) suggestions for clinicians approaching fertility counseling with adolescents considering hormone therapy.
Conclusions
Many gender diverse youth asserted an interest in building families, although the process of fertility preservation remains fraught. Relative to other studies, our participants were hopeful, imaginative, and interested in having children. Participants wanted to receive specific counseling on fertility, to receive help navigating the logistics of fertility preservation, and to be listened to when their hopes for children (or no children) were stated. Further research is needed to create care paradigms that address fertility of transgender youth in an affirming, developmentally appropriate manner.}

When considered as a biomass source, stumps can contribute to minimizing problems related to the restriction of the use of the area in terms of the use of the machines and operational quality, bringing economic and energy benefits or at least, avoiding costs. Therefore, this study aimed at evaluating the operational, economic and energy viability of a mechanized-harvesting system for collection of eucalyptus stumps. So, data related to the work capacity of the equipment were obtained by means of a time and motion of mechanized operations of stumps removal, carrying, processing, and transportation. A model was used to evaluate scenarios and to identify the critical variables. Results showed that the mechanized system used for stumps and roots removal, is operationally and economically viable and provides higher energy performance for this biomass. Total energy input (EI) of the system was 14.3 GJ ha−1, energy intensity 406.8 MJ t−1, EROI was 28.2 for 33 MJ MJ−1 and 4.0 for 4.3 MJ MJ−1 year−1 and a positive energy balance of 434.3 MJ ha−1. The final cost of producing of eucalyptus stump chips was 37.87 USD t−1, savings of USD 2.13 t-1 were obtained for the additional biomass. Restrictions for using this system refer to the minimum area and transportation distance. Additionally, variations in productivity, market price of biomass, and field operational capacity would affect the economic viability of this alternative.}

abstract = {Background
It has been observed that subjects with comorbidities related to metabolic syndrome (MetS) as hypertension, obesity, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and diabetes mellitus (DM2) show severe cases and a higher mortality by COVID-19. To date, there is little information available on the impact of the interaction between these comorbidities in the risk of death by COVID-19.
Aim of the Study
To evaluate the impact of the combinations of MetS components in overall survival (OS) and risk of death among COVID-19 patients.
Methods
Using public data of the Ministry of Health, suspected, and confirmed COVID-19 cases from February 25–June 6, 2020 was analyzed. Mortality odds ratio (OR) was calculated with a univariate analysis (95% CI) and attributable risk. Interactions between components and survival curves were analyzed and a multivariate logistics regression analysis was conducted.
Results
The analysis included 528,651 cases out of which 202,951 were confirmed for COVID-19. Probabilities of OS among confirmed patients were 0.93, 0.89, 0.87, 0.86, and 0.83 while the OR of multivariate analysis was 1.83 (1.77–1.89), 2.58 (2.48–2.69), 2.83 (2.66–3.01), and 3.36 (2.83–3.99) for zero, one, two, three, and four MetS components, respectively. The combination with the highest risk was DM2 + hypertension at 2.22 (2.15–2.28), and the attributable risk for any component was 9.35% (9.21–9.49). Only the combination obesity + CVD showed no significant interaction.
Conclusion
The presence of one MetS component doubles the risk of death by COVID-19, which was higher among patients with DM2 + hypertension. Only obesity and CVD do not interact significantly.}

Currently, the commercialization of cellulosic biofuel is proceeding at a slower pace than expected due to the high cost of the cellulosic biofuel supply chain (CBSC), especially in the manufacturing process. In this paper, a new model for a four-echelon CBSC incorporating 12 conversion pathways is proposed to minimize total supply chain cost by considering multiple time periods, various biomass types and spatial distributions, biomass and biofuel inventories, logistics, and different demand levels. Case studies from the state of Illinois in the U.S. are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. It is manifested that the model can select appropriate conversion pathways for biorefineries given the abundance of local resources to minimize the overall cost. Compared to the two cases adopted a single conversion pathway, the optimal result achieves 14.6% and 4.6% reductions on the unit biofuel cost, respectively. In addition, the results of sensitivity analysis indicate that the biorefinery construction cost and the biofuel throughput are the main economic drivers in the current supply chain design.}

This study focuses on the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method with using Geographical Information Systems (GIS) to detect the optimum probable location for an Antarctic research station. During the study, three main criteria groups and their sub-criteria were taken into account: spatial condition, accessibility, and international legal regime. The comparisons obtained from AHP method including GIS and surveys were used to find potentially suitable areas to demonstrate fitness-for-use of the allocation results. Finally, the suitability map was produced to identify the potential locations for the future Turkish Research Station by considering the climatic effects, environmental constraints, enabling logistics, cost and scientific interest. This study would help the decision-makers to take final steps for determining the potential Turkish Antarctic Station.}

The monitoring systems used for risk management strategies can reduce the impact of landslides. Despite that, the landslides along the TESH have not been continuously monitored due to the high costs and tricky logistics of conventional monitoring techniques. Satellite SAR interferometry demonstrated to be a useful complementary tool for landslide monitoring. This study aims to investigate the potential of satellite interferometric SAR techniques, such as conventional DInSAR and Advanced DInSAR (IPTA approach), for landslide identification and characterization in the Salsipuedes region. For this purpose, ENVISAT ASAR descending and ascending images from the 2003–2010 period have been used. The obtained results showed that, despite the limitations of the techniques, they could be effectively used for the slope displacements detection and monitoring. Based on the results of the interferometric processing, six landslides that have been active during the study period were identified, their geometric parameters were obtained, and their displacement rates were quantified. The landslides were classified as very slow based on measured LOS displacement rates (up to 5.5 cm/yr).}

In this paper, we review the literature on time-dependent routing problems, with a specific focus on benchmarks and performance criteria used to experimentally evaluate the interest of exploiting time-dependent data, showing the lack of studies on the impact of spatio-temporal features of the benchmark on solutions. Hence, we introduce a new benchmark produced from a realistic traffic flow micro-simulation of Lyon city, allowing us to consider different levels of spatial granularity (i.e., number of sensors used to measure traffic conditions) and temporal granularity (i.e., frequency of measures). Finally, we experimentally evaluate the impact of the spatio-temporal granularity on the quality of solutions for different classical problems, including the traveling salesman problem, the pickup and delivery problem, and the dial-a-ride problem.}

For all the studied feedstocks, curves of combustion displayed the similar patterns and trends under impacts of elevated heating rates and residue ratios, laying the foundation of co-combustion. Synergistic effects between blend components occurred and lowered the ignition temperature and combustion intensity, resulting in the relatively smaller apparent activation energy fluctuating between 22.95 and 48.51 kJ mol−1. Higher ash and lower volatile contents in residue leaded to the inferior co-combustion characteristics reflected by the decreased combustion indices. The maximum NOX emission reached 106.60 mg·Nm-3 with 40 wt. % residue in blends and could meet the most stringent standard requirements. Ashes presented a high or medium tendency of fouling and slagging, as one main barrier for thermal conversion. Risks of self-ignition indicated the medium or low chance of spontaneous combustion, benefitting to the logistics. On the whole, Flammulina velutipes residue can be considered a suitable addition to pine sawdust in co-combustion.}

The changes in establishment and extinction of firms with distinction by industry sector are evaluated using descriptive analysis and Difference in differences method. The results of the research show certain manifestations regarding the opening of the motorway, since the changes in firm birth intensity are the highest in the group of municipalities that are within 8–12 min' drive from the motorway, and with increasing distance from the motorway the intensity decreases. The link with the proximity of the motorway indicates increase of firms in general, within sector categories it stands for manufacturing industry, construction and logistics. At the same time, for municipalities at the distance of 12–20 min away we recorded slight decrease of firm birth intensity in comparison to a period before opening of the motorway section. These results indicate that the main road infrastructure positively influences only the nearest area.}

This system is affected by two independents and uncorrelated random variables that represent demand and return fluctuations. A Discrete-time, chance-constrained, Linear Quadratic Gaussian Problem under imperfect information of inventory systems (DCLQG) is formulated in order to develop an aggregate manufacturing and remanufacturing plan. Technically, an optimal closed-loop solution for this stochastic problem is possible, but it is not easy to get it, particularly for large size problems. Thus, an open-loop updating approach that provides a quasi-optimal solution is investigated here. This approach considers an equivalent deterministic problem to the DCLQG problem. It is based on the conditional mean value and on variances of inventory variables, which are estimated from a Kalman filter procedure. Such an approach allows managers to build an aggregated production plan, periodically revised, that helps them to make decisions. An open-loop updating approach is compared to a no-updating approach, which depends only on the initial condition of states of the system. An example shows the importance of information gathering to provide sub-optimal solutions for stochastic problems with imperfect information of states. It is also shown that sub-optimal production policies can improve the company’s profitability.}

Some technologies can change the current view and future expectations of our societies, and the way that people interact within their immediate environment. Remote communities offer the opportunity to research the next step in the evolution of technologies. Through the study of narratives, this paper investigates the remote, informal, and ephemeral communities of practices (RIE-CoP) that undertake the brief use of some technologies. The use of additive manufacturing technologies for improvised repairs, rapid tooling, the study of potential efficiency energetic measures, and previous tests in the Spanish Antarctic Base provide short-term benefits such as reducing emissions and logistics costs, and making life more sustainable on the frozen continent. Furthermore, these technology tests offer action-based research about the management and future of RIE-CoP under extreme conditions across four Antarctic missions (from December 2015 to March 2019). The experiences provide narrative foresight for the future RIE-CoP, and the results are valuable in sectors such as military and humanitarian assistance, construction, and space missions.}

abstract = {Due to demographic changes, the number of older workers employed in production and logistics environments increases continuously. During the execution of manual materials handling tasks that are still very common in these industries, especially older workers face an increased risk of developing musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). The substantial MSD rates we can observe in many countries could be decreased through an improvement in working conditions. Ergonomic observational methods play an important role in this context: they facilitate an ergonomic risk assessment of workplaces and work processes and, by comparing system alternatives, help to lower MSD risks. Despite their advantages, these methods have also been criticized in the past, especially because they are time-consuming and often provide subjective results. Markerless motion capturing technology could be used to overcome some of the limitations of ergonomic observational methods, as they could quickly provide objective posture data of the worker. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of works that develop solutions for evaluating manual materials handling activities at industrial workplaces using the Microsoft Kinect. Microsoft Kinect is an inexpensive markerless motion capturing system originally developed for Microsoft’s Xbox gaming console that has recently been used in industry-type settings as well. Information collected in a systematic search of the literature is used to develop a conceptual framework that is then employed to discuss and synthesize the sampled literature. The results of this review support researchers and practitioners in developing and evaluating Kinect-based systems that support the ergonomic evaluation of workplaces and the consequent improvement of working conditions.}

Many works in this domain mention the structural problem property of multimodality as a challenge from two classical perspectives: (1) finding all globally optimal solution sets, and (2) avoiding to get trapped in local optima. Interestingly, these streams seem to transfer many traditional concepts of single-objective (SO) optimization into claims, assumptions, or even terminology regarding the MO domain, but mostly neglect the understanding of the structural properties as well as the algorithmic search behavior on a problem’s landscape. However, some recent works counteract this trend, by investigating the fundamentals and characteristics of MO problems using new visualization techniques and gaining surprising insights. Using these visual insights, this work proposes a step towards a unified terminology to capture multimodality and locality in a broader way than it is usually done. This enables us to investigate current research activities in multimodal continuous MO optimization and to highlight new implications and promising research directions for the design of benchmark suites, the discovery of MO landscape features, the development of new MO (or even SO) optimization algorithms, and performance indicators. For all these topics, we provide a review of ideas and methods but also an outlook on future challenges, research potential and perspectives that result from recent developments.}

These materials offer a renewable alternative for oil-based plastics in applications, such as food packaging. In many applications, such as food packaging the material is coated with plastic layer or other materials. The stability and mechanical strength of the trays manufactured from these composite materials is highly important to ensure the functionality of the packages in production processes and logistics. Based on previous work it is known that heat has a significant effect on the formability of the materials. However, the effects of heat input on the stability after manufacturing has not been yet researched. The objectives of the paper were to investigate the effect of heat input and the presence of the plastic coating, based on the dwell time and the heating temperature, on the compression strength of the formed trays and the durability of the tray corner area. A series of experiments was performed using an extrusion-coated three-layer paperboard. The manufactured trays were analysed and the strength values were quantified experimentally. The experiments were performed on coated and uncoated paperboard to investigate the effects of the polymer layer. The results show the effect of the heat input on the tray properties. Based on the results, suggestions for process parameter optimization are given.}

There are no studies on epidemiologic characteristics of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), when specified at in patients with bilateral calcaneal fractures. This study aimed to address the preoperative DVT in bilateral calcaneal fractures. Between October 2014 and December 2018, adult patients presenting with bilateral calcaneal fractures and having preoperative Duplex ultrasound (DUS) of bilateral lower extremities for detection of DVT were included. Their medical data were collected, with regards to demographics, comorbidities, injury-related data and biomarkers. Baseline characteristics between patients with and without DVT were compared using bivariate tests. The further multivariate logistics regression analysis was conducted to identify independent factors associated with DVT. In total, 258 patients with bilateral calcaneal fractures were included, with 21 (8.1%) having preoperative DVT, diagnosed at 7.7 ± 4.2 days after injury. The prevalence rate of proximal DVT was 1.9% and of distal DVT was 6.2%. Thirty five thrombi were found, with 6 (17.1%) in proximal veins and 29 (82.9%) in distal veins. Nine patients had DVTs in multiple veins, and 2 patients had bilateral DVTs. The multivariate analyses showed history of allergy (odds ratio [OR] = 2.17), concurrent other fractures (OR = 4.53), prolonged time since injury (for each day, OR = 1.16), elevated plasma D-dimer level (≥1.73 vs <1.73 mg/L, OR = 3.74) and reduced albumin level (<34.2 g/L vs ≥34.2 g/L, OR = 2.92) were independent factors associated with DVT. Multiple factors were identified to be associated with DVT and greater consideration should be given to the use of pharmacologic prophylaxis in patients involving these factors, to reduce DVT occurrence.}

abstract = {In recent years, vending machines have seen increasing levels of popularity. In a fast-paced world where convenience and accessibility of products is highly sought after the vending industry has provided a suitable solution. Although the economic impact of the vending industry is indisputable, it is not without challenges, especially when it comes to the efficiency of the vending logistics operations. The optimisation of logistic vending machine systems is decidedly complex. Product allocation to columns in a vending machine, replenishment points of products, product thresholds at vending machines, and vehicle routes for inventory replenishments are all essential challenges in vending machine system management and operation. If all facets of the problem were to be addressed, it would require techniques such as forecasting, machine learning, data mining, combinatorial optimization and vehicle routing, among others. In the past, these approaches have been explored individually despite their intrinsic interdependence within the problem. This paper aims to help to fill in this gap and proposes a model for the optimisation of product allocation within a vending machine under the constraint of fixed restocking instances. The optimal product allocation is based on the definition of product profitability which accounts for the net revenue earned after the cost of restock, as opposed to the revenue earned until first stock-out to prevent arbitrary extension of the stock-out period. The whole approach is encompassed in the simulation-optimisation framework that utilises a Genetic Algorithm, with fitness evaluated as simulated revenue, to determine the optimal product allocation. The acceptable threshold of missed sales for a machine is also determined as a means to make intelligent restocking decisions. Overall, the proposed approach allows the strengths of mathematically robust optimization algorithms and the implementation of analytic solutions to be combined and applied to realistic scenarios where uncertainty may rule out some high quality analytic solutions. It respects problem intricacies proper to vending and addresses the interdependence between routing and portfolio optimisation. The proposal is application-driven and stems from a collaboration with an industry partner. The model is validated against an authentic data set supplied by the partner. The case study results revealed a network-wide improvement in net revenue of approximately 3.4%, with varied efficacy based on machine popularity. The method of optimisation was found to be significantly more effective for higher performing machines, with median improvements as high as 6%. Our framework based on the optimization-simulation model yields clear benefits to vending logistics operations management. The simulation component provides the decision maker with a more comprehensive view on the actual implementation of the solution. Effectively, the joint use of simulation and optimization methods provides managers with enhanced information to help decide on both: (i) the most beneficial product portfolio, and (ii) the quality of the proposed restocking schedules. Simulation-optimisation based approach is a powerful technique used to address stochastic problems. However, it was yet to be applied specifically to logistic vending machine systems.}

A systematic literature review was used to assess SCM research in IMM, identify themes and publication patterns, and use these themes to assess gaps in extant research and opportunities for future research. Results of the literature review show that over 58% of the SCM research published in IMM has focused on buyer-supplier relationships and other purchasing and supply management topics. These will continue to be key topics in IMM. In addition, our literature review suggests opportunities for more SCM research in IMM around sustainability, logistics, and manufacturing innovation. These areas within the SCM umbrella are under-researched, yet yield significant opportunities for future research in a time of constant change within companies' distribution models.}

New technologies are transforming the maritime transport sector, improving economic efficiency, optimizing the systems and operations of logistics management and enhancing connectivity. One of the problems that can benefit from the use of new technologies is finding the best transshipment schedule for incoming vessels. In this paper, we propose using automatic learning techniques to obtain a predictor of the robustness of transshipment schedules proposed by a scheduler. This measure of the goodness of the loading/unloading plan will consider the uncertainty to which processes in ports are subject, due to the weather, personnel skills, and the number of resources available, among other factors. Specifically, in this paper we propose using the so-called ‘decision tree’ algorithm to create a model for predicting the goodness of the proposed transshipment schedule. To obtain the historical data needed to train the machine-learning algorithm, we resorted to discrete event systems simulation, which can be used to test, for the same schedule, various scenarios with different disturbances. This yielded a model that predicts the behavior of the transshipment schedule based on the actual situation at the port.}

Stroke patients are frequently transported to a comprehensive stroke center for treatment, either from a regional hospital via interhospital transfer or from the field via direct-from-scene transfer, by air or ground transportation. We sought to determine whether air or ground transport was faster in both transfer circumstances.
Materials and methods
A retrospective study of patients transferred to a single comprehensive stroke center for stroke treatment was conducted. EMS and medical records were used to evaluate the time and distance of transfer and functional outcome.
Results
Of the 205 transfers, 47 were interhospital transfers by air (22.9%), 68 were interhospital transfers by ground (33.2%), 40 were scene transfers by air (19.5%), and 50 were scene transfers by ground (24.4%). Ground transfers had shorter alarm to EMS departure times (30 min. vs 40 min.; p<0.0001). Air transfers had shorter EMS departure to arrival times when normalized by transfer distance indicating a faster travel velocity. Interhospital transfers by air were predicted to be faster than ground over 40 miles, and scene transfers by air were predicted to be faster than ground over 28 miles. Transfer mode had no significant effect on functional outcome when controlling for tPA, thrombectomy, and NIH Stroke Scale in this small study.
Conclusions
Transfer efficiency for stroke patients depends on logistics prior to EMS arrival as well as the speed of travel. While air transport clearly results in faster travel velocity, total interhospital transfer times are faster for air transportation only when traveling more than 40 miles.}

Rigid robot gripper shows good characters like robustness, accuracy and short response time. This paper thus presents a robot self-adaptive gripper using rigid fingers, where four rigid fingers are connected by springs that are tied to a screw rod. The screw rod is actuated by a rotary motor. Tip force of the fingers could be precisely controlled by the linear movement of the screw rod. The shapes and sizes of the object could be adaptively grasped due to the elasticity of the connecting springs. The proposed gripper is tested and verified to be highly flexible and controllable so that it could be suitable for most of the applications in production systems in the context of Industrial Internet.}

abstract = {Background
Malaysia is experiencing population ageing and expects to be an aged nation by 2030. Depression is one of the common disorder among elderly worldwide and the prevalence of depression in Malaysia is expected to increase as a result of population ageing. The association of depression and sexual satisfaction was unclear, particularly among the elderly. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the association between depression and sexual satisfaction among the Malay elderly population.
Methods
One hundred and nine married community-dwelling elderly (Mean age = 63.23 years old) participated in this cross-sectional study. Hierarchical logistics regression was used to examine the association of depression on sexual satisfaction while controlling for potential confounders.
Results
Prevalence of depression and sexual dissatisfaction were 26.6% and 20.2%, respectively. Depression was significantly associated with sexual satisfaction (P = 0.002; OR = 0.19, 95% CI = 0.06, 0.66). Depressed participants were 81% less likely to experience sexual satisfaction compared to those without depression.
Limitations
Cross-sectional study design assessing the association between depression and sexual satisfaction.
Conclusions
Findings from this study suggest that attention should be given to the prevention and treatment of depression among the elderly as a mechanism to improve sexual health.}

Beside the societal challenges these areas are strongly related to technologies and innovations. Gathering information about emerging technologies plays an increasing role for the entire research in these areas. Humans’ information processing can be strongly supported by Visual Analytics that combines automatic modelling and interactive visualizations. The juxtapose orchestration of interactive visualization enables gathering more information in a shorter time. We propose in this paper an approach that goes beyond the established methods of dashboarding and enables visualizing different databases, data-sets and sub-sets of data with juxtaposed visual interfaces. Our approach should be seen as an expandable method. Our main contributions are an in-depth analysis of visual task models and an approach for juxtaposing visual layouts as visual dashboards to enable solving complex tasks. We illustrate our main outcome through a case study that investigates the area of mobility and illustrates how complex analytical tasks can be performed easily by combining different visual interfaces.}

The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has significantly impacted the delivery of cellular therapeutics, including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. This impact has extended beyond patient care to include logistics, administration, and distribution of increasingly limited health care resources. Based on the collective experience of the CAR T-cell Consortium investigators, we review and address several questions and concerns regarding cellular therapy administration in the setting of COVID-19 and make general recommendations to address these issues. Specifically, we address (1) necessary resources for safe administration of cell therapies; (2) determinants of cell therapy utilization; (3) selection among patients with B cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas and B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia; (4) supportive measures during cell therapy administration; (5) use and prioritization of tocilizumab; and (6) collaborative care with referring physicians. These recommendations were carefully formulated with the understanding that resource allocation is of the utmost importance, and that the decision to proceed with CAR T cell therapy will require extensive discussion of potential risks and benefits. Although these recommendations are fluid, at this time it is our opinion that the COVID-19 pandemic should not serve as reason to defer CAR T cell therapy for patients truly in need of a potentially curative therapy.}

Supply chain management could create value for bespoke service providers, customers and stakeholders cooperating through the supply chain. Bespoke service provider companies are responsible for managing their asset based on different service contracts and possibly through the end of the asset lifetime. Providing a through-life service requires tailored strategic dimensions to measure the supply chain performance. The performance can be evaluated with regards to several supply chain elements such as demand management, procurement, logistics, etc. This article takes a different angle to the current supply chain performance frameworks by discussing performance through DMAIC cycle. Considering a through-life service, this paper presents a performance optimization framework to improve the supply chain performance in terms of an asset or component availability and cost of service. Moreover, an exhaustive list of KPIs to evaluate the supply chain performance are identified. A case study of fleet management for a bespoke service provider is considered to test the validity of the framework. The DMAIC technique has demonstrated to be an effective method to improve supply chain strategies and performance.}

Data reconciliation is a data preprocessing technique which can improve the accuracy of measured data through process modeling and optimization, and can also be used for gross error detection together with a statistical test method. In this study, data reconciliation and gross error detection are used to an industrial coal gasification plant firstly, which identifies the departing variables, produces missing measurements and evaluates gasification key performance. The reconciled results show that: the accuracy of the primary measurement coal mass flow is improved a lot according to the high Gain value of >42%; the measured raw syngas production is distant from the real value a lot and corrected through reconciliation by 12% lower; the more accurate measurements for the same syngas composition detection are identified; the unmeasured gasifier temperature is calculated with good accuracy of ±56K, and also the distribution of unconverted carbon/ash are calculated; the KPIs are reconciled with improved accuracy due to the improvement of the measurements involved in the KPIs calculation. The results demonstrate that, for such coal gasification plants with complex multiphase logistics and multiple devices, data reconciliation is a valuable tool and shows important significance to help the plants improve measurement accuracy and realize reliable operation.}

The G2ELRP aims to minimize the total fuel consumption depending on the distance and the road conditions in both echelons. In the G2ELRP, that a customer can be served more than once is considered as a new constraint. Due to its complexity, the G2ELRP requires a complex problem formulation. A new variable neighborhood strategy adaptive search (VaNSAS) algorithm as a solution approach is introduced to solve the problem. The computational results indicate that the VaNSAS algorithm efficiently solves the case study problem and outperforms all other proposed heuristics. The G2ELRP model saved fuel cost by 3.71% over the traditional LRP. This demonstrates that the proposed VaNSAS is very efficient and not only useful for decreasing costs of rubber logistics, but also for application to other related agro-industries.}

Storage location assignment and crane scheduling are both important problems in slab yards, which connect the continuous casting area and the hot rolling area and play a vital buffer role in maintaining the balance of the hot rolling production process. This paper presents a mixed integrated programming (MIP) model with two objectives – relocation rate and feed length, which indicate the performance of storage location assignment and crane scheduling in an unmanned slab yard, respectively. To solve this multi-objective optimization problem with large-scale parameters and complicated constraints, this paper proposes to modify the standard NSGA-III (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III) by employing dispatching rules-based initial population generation, adaptive crossover and mutation operations, and improved reference point generation. A case study with actual inventory and production data shows that the proposed algorithm reduces the relocation rate from 30% to 10%. The well-known MOEA/D (Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm Based on Decomposition) is applied to compare the performance of the modified NSGA-III. The quality of the Pareto front and the objective values indicate that the proposed algorithm can achieve the integrated optimization of storage location assignment and crane scheduling and performs better than MOEA/D.}

We employ structural equation modeling method to test hypotheses based on survey responses from 200 Chinese manufacturers. The categorization of behavioral and technical GSCM practices and research findings contribute to the GSCM literature. Statistical results demonstrate the complete mediation effect of technical GSCM practices (e.g., green design, green manufacturing and reverse logistics) on the relationship between behavioral GSCM practices (e.g., relationship with customers and suppliers) and organizational performance.

Cervical cancer is a leading cause of cancer-associated mortality among women in India, with 96,922 new cases and 60,078 deaths each year, almost one-fifth of the global burden. In 2018, Sikkim state in India introduced human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine for 9–13-year-old girls, primarily through school-based vaccination, targeting approximately 25,000 girls. We documented the program’s decision-making and implementation processes.
Methods
We conducted a post-introduction evaluation in 2019, concurrent with the second dose campaign, by interviewing key stakeholders (state, district, and local level), reviewing planning documents, and observing cold chain sites in two purposefully-sampled community areas in each of the four districts of Sikkim. Using standard questionnaires, we interviewed health and education officials, school personnel, health workers, community leaders, and age-eligible girls on program decision-making, planning, training, vaccine delivery, logistics, and communication.
Results
We conducted 279 interviews and 29 observations in eight community areas across four districts of Sikkim. Based on reported administrative data, Sikkim achieved >95% HPV vaccination coverage among targeted girls for both doses via two campaigns; no severe adverse events were reported. HPV vaccination was well accepted by all stakeholders; minimal refusal was reported. Factors identified for successful vaccine introduction included strong political commitment, statewide mandatory school enrollment, collaboration between health and education departments at all levels, and robust social mobilization strategies.
Conclusions
Sikkim successfully introduced the HPV vaccine to multiple-age cohorts of girls via school-based vaccination, demonstrating a model that could be replicated in other regions in India or similar low- and middle-income country settings.}

The proposal is based on three main components: Nb3Sn lead extensions, NbTi bus bars and HTS current leads. We propose three different bus bar designs – for the TF, CS and PF coil feeders, respectively. Two additional values of the TF operating current are considered. The structural verification of the bus bars, including an S-bend geometry for reducing the mechanical loads due to cool down, is performed both analytically and by means of 3D finite-element simulations. In addition, we present an outline design of the HTS current leads, based on the minimisation of the cryogenic heat load and the simulation of a loss-of-flow accident. Finally, we briefly discuss the main characteristics of the joints, as well as some integration and assembly challenges.}

abstract = {Combining physical activity and academic content is a promising way to improve health and academic learning in schoolchildren. This paper examined the continuation of physically active lessons (PAL) in five Norwegian elementary schools, two years after a 10-month intervention period, which consisted of weekly minimum 2 x 45 min of PAL. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with nine teachers and five school leaders. The Level of Use instrument was used to assess how the teachers integrated PAL into the school day. Two years after the intervention period, seven of nine teachers conducted PAL regularly, on average one lesson per week. Teachers’ implementation progress varied from struggling with logistics, to stable routine and creative adaption. Perceived benefits for the children, active leadership, and ongoing implementation support seem important for continuation. Introduction of PAL as a school development project, systematic planning from the onset and a gradual introduction of PAL, can be an effective strategy for continuation and long-term sustainability. In addition, the Level of Use instrument was useful to better understand which support mechanisms are needed at different stages in the implementation of PAL.}
