abstract = {Cost-efficient, environmental-friendly and socially sustainable biomass supply chains are urgently needed to achieve the 2020 targets of the Strategic Energy Technologies-Plan of the European Union. This paper investigated technical, social, economic, and environmental barriers to the development and innovation of supply chains, taking into account a large range of parameters influencing the performances of biomass systems at supply chain scale. An assessment framework was developed that combined economic optimization of a supply chain with a holistic and integrated sustainability assessment. The framework was applied to a case-study involving miscanthus biomass in the Burgundy region (Eastern France) to compare alternative biomass supply chain scenarios with different annual biomass demand, crop yield, harvest timing and densification technologies. These biomass supply chain scenarios were first economically optimized across the whole supply chain (from field to plant gate) by considering potential feedstock production (from a high-resolution map), costs, logistical constraints and product prices. Then sustainability assessment was conducted by combining recognized methodologies: economic analysis, multi-regional input-output analysis, emergy assessment, and life-cycle assessment. The analysis of the case study scenarios found that expanding biomass supply from 6,000 to 30,000tons of dry matter per year did not impact the profitability, which remained around 20€perton of biomass procured. Regarding environmental impacts, the scenario with the lowest feedstock supply area had the lowest impact per ton due to low economies of scale. Mobile briquetting proved to be also a viable economic option, especially in situations with a considerable scattering of the crop production and expensive transportation logistics. By highlighting hot-spots in terms of economic, environmental and social impacts of biomass supply systems, this study provides guidance in the supply chain optimization and the design of technological solutions tailored to economic operators as well as other stakeholders, such as policy makers.}

In this paper, we consider a two-echelon reverse supply chain (RSC) with one manufacturer and one retailer who try to improve sustainable consumption by increasing customers’ willingness to return used products through offering a discount or a direct fee in exchange for bringing back EOL products. Afterward, the model is extended to consider a closed loop supply chain (CLSC). Quantity discounts and increasing fee contracts are proposed to coordinate supply chains. Then, government role in improving coordinated supply chains through donating different incentives (tax exemption and subsidy) to supply chain members are analyzed. Results show that total channel profit in the coordinated case is improved. Also, in the proposed models, each member has enough motives to participate in the plan. In addition, results demonstrate that government-sponsored incentives to the manufacturer are preferred to the retailer.}

The combination of the MILP formulation with an optimization solver constitutes a decision-support tool to aid engineers reach optimal decisions for a planning horizon. To handle large-scale instances, rolling-horizon and relax-and-fix strategies are proposed.}

We also present numerical examples for which it is useful to have both disposal options.

abstract = {This paper presents a novel Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time-Dependent Demand (CVRP-TDD) applied to humanitarian logistics. This is a problem where the demand is time dependent and the objective is to maximize the total satisfied demand. When a disaster strikes a territory, the people go directly to shelters. If they do not receive the first aid, water, food, etc. They tend to flee out of the shelters looking for the aid outside of the affected area. This mobilization of people generates an increase in the chaos already caused by the disaster. The aid must arrive at shelters as quickly as possible to stop this mobilization. We developed a mixed integer linear program (MILP) and a column generation (CG) algorithm where the promising columns are generated using dynamic programming (DP). In CG algorithm, two dominance rules and one heuristic are proposed to solve the problem. The algorithm is tested on small and medium instances. CG gives good bounds and find more optimal solutions than those reported by MILP in less than one hour. Also, we show that the heuristic improves significantly the solution time.}

abstract = {Predicting soil property distribution from a catena in the digital environment has been explored by many researchers with only slightly better than modest results. In this study, the landform recognition algorithm “geomorphons” in the GRASS GIS environment was explored to determine if this landscape model could improve predictions of soil properties. For 74 borings on the Wabash glacial moraine in Wells County, Indiana, measurements were made for: A horizon thickness, depth to chroma 2 features, effervescence, dense glacial till, carbonate concretions, and autochthonous platy structure. A digital elevation model (DEM) generated from light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data was used for the study site. The geomorphons algorithm was used to generate 10 original landforms: “flat”, “footslope”, “summit”, “ridge”, “shoulder”, “spur”, “slope”, “hollow”, “valley”, and “depression” that were aggregated to new landforms coinciding with slope positions: “toeslope”, “footslope”, “backslope”, “shoulder”, “summit”, and “depression” recognized by soil surveyors. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Multinomial Logistics Regression Analysis (MLR) were used to aggregate the measured soil properties into the landform groups. The aggregation of geomorphons groups improved the MRL predictions to 83% accuracy. Also, the aggregation of geomorphons to five landforms to predict soil property distribution on the landscape gave promising results for the low-relief and relatively flat area of northeast Indiana. To test if the true mean value of each soil property for each landform was reliable for generalizing population characteristics, relative standard error (RSE) was calculated as a proportion of standard error to population mean from a bootstrap estimation. The range of RSE values for all soil properties and landforms was between ~0.7% and ~19%. Since the estimates of the measured soil properties all have RSE values of less than 25%, they can be considered reliable.}

In particular, we propose a maxmin probabilistic programming model that includes two types of probabilistic constraints: one concerning the utilization rate of the selected shelters and the other concerning the capacity of those shelters. By invoking the central limit theorem we are able to obtain an optimization model with a single set of non-linear constraints which, nonetheless, can be approximated using a family of piecewise linear functions. The latter, in turn, can be modeled mathematically using integer variables. Eventually, an approximate model is obtained, which is a mixed-integer linear programming model that can be tackled by an off-the-shelf solver. Using the proposed reformulation we are able to solve instances of the problem using data associated with the Kartal district in Istanbul, Turkey. We also consider a large-scale instance of the problem by making use of data for the whole Anatolian side of Istanbul. The results obtained are presented and discussed in the paper. They provide clear evidence that capturing uncertainty in the shelter site location problem by means of probabilistic constraints may lead to solutions that are much different from those obtained when a deterministic counterpart is considered. Furthermore, it is possible to observe that the probabilities embedded in the probabilistic constraints have a clear influence in the results, thus supporting the statement that a probabilistic programming modeling framework, if appropriately tuned by a decision maker, can make a full difference when it comes to find good solutions for the problem.}

abstract = {We introduce and solve the Vehicle Routing Problem with Simultaneous Pick-ups and Deliveries and Two-Dimensional Loading Constraints (2L-SPD). The 2L-SPD model covers cases where customers raise delivery and pick-up requests for transporting non-stackable rectangular items. 2L-SPD belongs to the class of composite routing-packing optimization problems. However, it is the first such problem to consider bi-directional material flows dictated in practice by reverse logistics policies. The aspect of simultaneously satisfying deliveries and pick-ups has a major impact on the underlying loading constraints: feasible loading patterns must be identified for every arc traveled in the routing plan. This implies that 2L-SPD generalizes previous routing problem variants with two-dimensional loading constraints which call for one feasible loading per route. From a managerial perspective, the simultaneous service of deliveries and pick-ups may bring substantial cost-savings, but the generalized loading constraints are very hard to tackle in reasonable computational times. To this end, we propose an optimization framework which employs memorization techniques designed for the 2L-SPD model, to accelerate the solution methodology. To assess the performance of our routing and packing algorithmic components, we have solved the Vehicle Routing Problem with Simultaneous Pick-ups and Deliveries (VRPSPD) and the Vehicle Routing Problem with Two-Dimensional Constraints (2L-CVRP). Computational results are also reported on newly constructed 2L-SPD benchmark problems. Apart from the basic 2L-SPD version, we introduce the 2L-SPD with LIFO constraints which prohibit item rearrangements along the routes. Computational experiments are conducted to understand the impact of the LIFO constraints on the routing plans obtained.}

The capacity of the pick face is not large enough to store all SKUs, so that the crane has to ensure that all SKUs demanded by a current picking order are timely provided and picker idle time is avoided. We aim at a processing sequence of picking orders and a SKU switching plan, i.e., an instruction when to exchange which SKUs in the picking level, such that an unobstructed order picking is enabled. Our problem is closely related to the tool switching problem of flexible manufacturing. Here, each job requires a subset of tools to be loaded into the tool magazine (with limited capacity) of a single flexible machine. We, however, show that an alternative objective function, i.e., minimizing the maximum number of switches between any successive job pair, is better suited in the warehouse context and even better results can be obtained by a multi-objective approach. Elementary complexity proofs as well as suited solution procedures are provided and we also address managerial aspects, such as the sizing of the pick face.}

The objectives are: maximizing satisfaction of the needs at the emergency grain demand points, minimizing total cost of grain distribution and minimizing the distribution time. A hybrid algorithm is present to solve the proposed problem based on combining artificial immune and ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithms. This hybrid algorithm calculates the degree of crowding and conducts non-dominated sorting of the population in the ant colony optimization algorithm by applying a Pareto optimization model. A better solution set is quickly generated by making use of the fast global convergence and randomness of the improved immune algorithm together with the distributed search ability and positive feedback of the ACO algorithm. A better solution set obtained as the initial pheromone distribution, is solved further by using ACO until the approximate optimal solution set is obtained. A comparison of the proposed algorithm with several common optimization algorithms on the Solomon benchmark dataset demonstrates that this method obtains better performance in shorter time, and is an efficient way to solve the vehicle routing problem in emergency grain distribution scenarios.}

Moreover, products are distributed to consumers from some of these retail stores based on product availability at inventory and by means of the same fleet of vehicles. This variant of the vehicle routing problem can be found in omni-channel retail distribution systems. Retail distribution systems are considered omni- or multi-channel systems when consumers can either place orders online or physically visit the stores to buy the products. In this problem, the decisions of assigning consumers to retail stores based on inventory availability are combined with finding the routes of vehicles. The new problem can be considered a generalization of both capacitated vehicle routing problem and the pickup and delivery problem. The paper presents a mathematical formulation to describe this problem and proposes two solution approaches (two-phase heuristic and multi-ant colony algorithm).

Selection of particular warehouse strategy usually depends on basic warehouse tasks, structure and size of customer orders, handled logistic units, costs of materials handling in particular sub-processes (both financial and time costs), availability of storage space and labour resources, etc. Therefore, probability of selecting the particular strategy is dependent on technical and organizational factors. Because of that, the paper presents some approach to selecting warehousing strategy. This approach takes into account mentioned technical and organizational factors. It also uses decision-making tree which shows probabilities of selection subsequent warehouse operations (in particular moment and warehouse situation) as well as probability of such situations as e.g. shipment suspending or cancelation in case of choosing a given strategy.

It has, therefore, become essential to improve the channel’s distribution process in order to meet the customers’ orders in the shortest time, and in a cost-effective manner, thus complying with the delivery terms agreed upon with the market. To this end, one studied aspects such as the mapping of the supply flow process, the occupation of space and the spaghetti-dash diagram of four current distribution process activities. Besides these, one also analyzed the calculation of productivity, cycle times, takt time, as well as the service level designed, with the purpose of preparing a system to evaluate company performance. In addition to these studies, one resorted to the ABC and SWOT customers’ analyses in order to develop the improvement proposal, which was characterized by: (a) changes in the layout, (b) improvements in the supply flow, (c) implementation of gravity carriers, as well as more ergonomic forms of transport, and (d) the use of computer applications developed in Visual Basic language for the distribution process. Based on this proposal, one succeeded in increasing the amount sorted out by the distributor in an eight-hour shift to 294 articles (11,23%). Cycle time was reduced from 0,015 minutes/article to 0,013 minutes/article (13,33%), which allows for the segregation of articles in time for the next collections. In addition, the occupied space was reduced to 47 m2 on average per collection (1,39%), which is translated into a reduction of 1 498 468 meters (23,34%) in the average distance covered per collection. Furthermore, the number of workers was reduced, on average, by five employees (12,82%) per collection. The storage capacity of the finished product was also increased by 535 boxes (11,30%). The total investment needed to achieve these changes is established as being 23 754,42 €; yet, the payback time involved will only be six months, resulting in a cumulative profit of 84 504,23 € by the end of the fall/winter 2020 collection.}

The spatial variabilities in soil type, topography, climate, and crop management practices further require vast computational time and resources to estimate the availability of sustainable biomass for a large study area. In this study, we developed a GIS-based integrated predictive modeling platform to assess the availability of sustainable crop residues at high spatial (30 m) and temporal (2010–2022) scales. A GIS-based multi-criteria inclusion-exclusion analysis and facility location-allocation models were used to identify suitable sites, and optimal siting of biogas plants respectively with biomass delivered cost. The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based predictive models were well suited to predict sustainability indicators (soil erosion SE- R2 = 0.96, soil conditioning index, SCI R2 = 0.98 and organic matter factor, OMF- R2 = 0.83) for assessing sustainable removal rates of crop residues (corn stover and wheat straw). The GIS-based integrated model was applied to the State of Ohio and found that about 4–13 dry Tg of crop residues can be sustainably available to build 1–25 regional biogas plants. A typical optimal biogas plant with a feedstock capacity of up to 500 dry Gg could be drawn from a transport radius of about 19–35 km with a delivered cost of 40–46 $ dry Mg−1. The temporal and spatial variations in assessing the availability of biomass largely affected the supply chain decisions and its delivered costs.}

abstract = {In most European congested urban areas the rail tracks of the 19th and 20th century serving locations of industry and goods stations were removed, transformed for public passenger transport, closed down or used for other purposes. The main reasons might be the de-industrialisation of the inner cities and the centralisation of the supply-sector (wholesale markets, shopping centres). Simultaneous the urban areas got an excellent road network on the surface and an efficient public transport system in the underground or on dedicated tracks. Nevertheless the amount of goods delivered to urban areas increased due to material prosperity. In this context “METRO.FREIGHT.2020” analysed the possibilities of a reinforced utilisation of railway infrastructure for freight transport on the first and the last miles within the urban regions in Austria as exemplified in case studies for the metropolitan Region of Vienna, the agglomerations of Graz and Linz and for the urbanised Rhine-Valley in Vorarlberg. In this context the focus point of consideration was the interface of transport and urban development, to a lesser extent the theoretical approach behind. As a fundamental milestone a cadastre of existing or recoverable sidings or other rail shipping points has been surveyed. They were evaluated in respect of serviceability concerning tracking freight trains in the rail network and extensibility in the service area which was complemented with propositions for further developing. The recommendations focus measures intending technically and economically operable access points to rail net on one hand and potentially appropriate access points for the future. But, to reach this goal more strengthened integration of commercial location policy and of shippers’ transport demands with a coordinated land use planning and an infrastructure development policy is required. Finally the methodical approach elaborated comprises following components to push more rail freight shipping:•Traffic zoning is a hierarchical spatial approach subdividing an urban region in sectors, zones and ‘agglomerates’ as spheres of activity for political and private actors involved in freight traffic generation and infrastructure affaires.•Surveying a multimodal topology of infrastructure network which integrates all transport modes in its layout of freight infrastructure propped up on a public platform of a multimodal network graph in future.•Characterizing an ‘agglomerate’ typology of shipping sites with affinity to rail which describes the typical initial position and development trends of the freight transport inducing traffic zones.•Shaping spatial structures which consist of super structures of shipping industrial sites as traffic generators, the infrastructure with its capacity for freight movements and the ‘metastructure’ as external affected settlements and land uses are prime targets and intervention objects, the coordinated measures have to be allocated to. The railway operators are called on to offer more flexible train and operation forms tailored to the logistics of shippers if the rail infrastructure within the serving area from the consolidation node to the sidings enables it. In the end three scenarios have been identified, namely a scenario of ultimate displacement of rail freight service in towns, a retarding scenario which brakes the retreat of rail connected with a change of paradigm in transport and traffic planning leading into an offensive scenario of ‘clean freight mobility’ to revitalize and extend rail freight operations into areas of high consumption.}

With regard of testing materials in a HTS flexible processes and process inherent restrictions have to be controlled. Currently it has not been researched whether a logistical control method which is able to deal with these requirements exist. Due to this, in this early approach the influence of order release and sequence planning in a HTS with occurring ad hoc changes like partial testing and re-routing is considered and evaluated.

A prominent example are deep-lane storage systems, which are often applied in the refrigerated warehouses of the food industry. The price for the high space utilization of these compact storage systems is, thus, a larger retrieval effort whenever items are not properly stored according to increasing due dates. Due dates, however, are often bound to uncertainties, e.g., due to untimely arrivals of the outbound vehicles picking up the stored items. This paper introduces a new way to derive robust storage assignments, such that excessive retrieval effort is avoided in spite of due date uncertainty. Specifically, we aim to maximize the minimum time difference between due dates of items dedicated to different vehicles and stored in the same stack or queue. The resulting optimization problem is defined, computational complexity is proven, and suited solution procedures are derived. Furthermore, a simulation study investigates whether our novel storage assignments are indeed more robust against unforeseen delays than previous approaches.}

However, a primary problem is the formation of coalitions. In this article, we study the so-called coalition configuration problem, in which any company can collaborate in more than one coalition. This is more general than the classic coalition structure problem, where a company must belong to only one coalition. We develop two approaches for coalition configuration in transportation. One is area-driven, which assumes the whole territory is divided into areas and then finds coalitions within each area by integer linear models. The other approach consists of a mixed integer linear programming model that embeds the coalition configuration in the transportation problem. Our motivation comes from a real world case in the forest fuels industry in Sweden, involving 27 companies, 200,000 transports, and 6 million tonnes of forest biomass, equivalent to 17 terawatt hours of energy consumption. Collaborative transportation renders about 8% of potential cost savings in this case, and may also help to increase the use of bioenergy. The coalition configuration increases by about 2.5% the savings obtained by the coalition structure and is competitive with the savings of the grand coalition.}

Speed optimization strategies applied in tactical vessel planning significantly reduce fuel consumption and thus emissions. Nevertheless, the environmental performance of these strategies in rough weather conditions is difficult to estimate as the duration of supply vessel operations is weather dependent. In this paper we develop a simulation-optimization tool which estimates the average fuel consumption for weekly vessel schedules. The schedules are constructed by using speed optimized vessel voyages which are simulated under different weather conditions. Results of experiments on real instances show that rough weather conditions increase fuel consumption and costs. The application of speed optimization strategies reduces fuel consumption both in winter and summer, but the reduction may be at the expense of a fixed vessel cost increase in the winter season.}

It facilitates tracking batch coordinates but prevents rigorously enforcing forbidden product sequences when dealing with intermediate dual-purpose nodes. Such models require the initial characterization of the pipeline and total number of batches as inputs, decisions that can be non-trivial. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents a new mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation for straight pipelines with a single tuning parameter, the number of event points in the grid. It is derived from Generalized Disjunctive Programming (GDP) followed by a convex hull reformulation. Compared to a product-centric formulation based on the Resource-Task Network (RTN), it is much simpler, smaller in size and can be up to two orders of magnitude faster. Comparison to its batch-centric counterpart is not as favorable, the highlight being an 8% improvement in makespan for a benchmark problem.}

During the last few years, many logistics and operations research problems have been extended to include greenhouse effect issues and costs related to the environmental impact of industrial and transportation activities. In this paper a new mathematical model for the calculation of greenhouse gas emissions is developed and a new model for the CLRP considering fuel consumption minimization is proposed. This model, named Green CLRP (G-CLRP), is represented by a mixed integer linear problem, which is characterized by incorporating a set of new constraints focused on maintaining the problem connectivity requirements. The model proposed is formulated as a bi-objective problem, considering the minimization of operational costs and the minimization of environmental effects. A sensitivity analysis in instances of different sizes is done to show that the proposed objective functions are indeed conflicting goals. The proposed mathematical model is solved with the classical epsilon constraint technique. The results clearly show that the proposed model is able to generate a set of tradeoff solutions leading to interesting conclusions about the operational costs and the environmental impact. This set of solutions is useful in the decision process because several planning alternatives can be considered at strategic level.}

This is achieved through analysis of 3D information obtained with a monocular camera in outdoor environments and under uncontrolled lighting, contrast, and occlusion conditions. This study was performed on 30 coffee branches, monitored throughout the entire harvest season, at each of nine collection times, directly in the countryside. On each branch checked, the fruit was counted in three maturation stages: unripe, semi-ripe and ripe. Subsequently, the real ripeness percentage was computed for each stage of development. Images were acquired from the same manually checked branches, and the developed algorithm was run. This algorithm performs a reconstruction producing a point cloud, employing Structure from Motion (SfM). In all, 17 features were selected to describe the three maturation stages, leaves, and stem. These features were calculated in a region proportional to the size of the point cloud. The 3D structures of the coffee fruits on the branch were obtained and classified, with between 42% and 92% of correct classification percentage for the unripe, semi-ripe, and ripe developmental stages, and the best classification model was selected, with a neighborhood that was 6.5% of the total size of the point cloud. A statistical estimation model was constructed for each stage of development, and it was found that the model overestimates the percentage of ripe fruit, underestimates that of semi-ripe fruit, and the unripe fruit estimate is one to one. The errors in estimation were between 3.7% and 8.7%. Correlation was between 0.64 and 0.98. Finally, temporary monitoring was performed for the ripening of coffee branches during the harvest season, with nine collection times. A maturation index was determined, with which the state of a branch as ready or not for harvest was correctly determined with 83% efficiency.}

However, these models typically adopt a global optimization point of view, which may not be attainable since they do not consider the actual decision-making process after a disaster occurs. This process is based mostly on practitioners' knowledge and experience, rules of thumb and the population behavior. In this paper, we develop a new mathematical model that incorporates such practical considerations. The model includes actual post-disaster decisions through a set of “humanitarian constraints”. We then present an efficient optimal solution method to solve small/medium-size instances of the resulting problem and a heuristic algorithm based on the Tabu-search method for large instances of the problem. We test our methods on problems with randomly generated data, as well as real data obtained from the Geophysical Institute of Israel. The results demonstrate that our heuristic performs exceptionally well, and optimal solutions are obtained in almost all cases. More importantly, we show that ignoring the actual decision-making process that occurs at the post-disaster stage results in inferior actual overall solutions. Using the humanitarian constraints improves the entire supply chain performance. Therefore, it is critical to accurately incorporate post-disaster decisions during the pre-disaster planning phase.}

We examine opportunities for modifying the network carbon footprint by changing network design variables. To do so, a quantitative distribution network model is established, and 150 scenarios are calculated by modifying real-world shipment data from an existing multinational FMCG manufacturer. Four distribution variables are identified for a many-to-many and a hub-and-spoke network structure. Two variables affect the distribution network and two interfere in the shipment structure by manipulating weight and/or the delivery date. This research sheds light on the extent of the changes in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of the distribution network that result from modifications in the logistics variables. The greatest effect on the quantity of GHG emissions can be observed when an anticipation horizon for orders is introduced. When shipments are consolidated and delivered only weekly or biweekly from the manufacturer to the retailers, GHG emissions drop significantly. Another opportunity for retailers to cut down GHG emissions is based on the concept of minimum order quantities where shipments to a retailer location are bundled until a certain weight is reached. Additionally, total GHG emissions of distribution may be reduced by raising the tonnage limit, thereby triggering direct shipments between the manufacturer’s facilities and the retailer locations, or by raising the tonnage limit, which triggers direct shipments in the logistics service provider network. The extent of GHG reduction is assessed for all investigated variables.}

Thus, automatically recognizing which task phases mobile workers are in and estimating their task progress is crucial for many aiding applications (e.g., task scheduling) utilizing coordination mechanisms (e.g., visualization of co-workers’ task progresses and notifications based on context awareness). This paper presents methods to sense and detect highly mobile workers’ task phases and progresses in large building complexes. These methods make use of data from sensing systems common in large-scale indoor work environments, such as WiFi infrastructures providing coarse grained indoor positioning, inertial sensors in the workers’ mobile phones, and from task management systems logging scheduled tasks. The methods presented have low requirements on sensing accuracy and thus come with low deployment and maintenance effort in real-world settings. We evaluated the proposed methods in a large hospital complex, where the highly mobile workers were recruited among the non-clinical workforce. The evaluation is based on manually labeled real-world data collected over 4 days of regular work life. The collected data yields 83 tasks in total involving 8 different employees of a major university hospital with a building area of 160,000 m2. The results show that the proposed methods can with reasonable accuracy i) distinguish between the four most common task phases present in the workers’ routines, achieving F1-Scores of 89.2%, and ii) estimate the task progress, yielding a mean error of 126.82 seconds for estimating the time until task completion and of 9.49 pp for estimating task progress.}

It is difficult to ignore the key role of green principles in balancing environmental and economic performance for companies facing community, and competitive pressures. In this paper, a multi-objective multi-period multi-product multi-site aggregate production planning (APP) model is presented in a green supply chain considering a reverse logistic (RL) network. In the proposed model, products are scored in terms of environmental criteria such as recyclability, biodegradability, energy consumption and product risk, using analytical hierarchy process (AHP). Speaking in simple terms, the AHP concept is utilized to get one single indicator that describes environmental impact of various production alternatives. Some other green indicators including waste management, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions arising from production methods and transportation are embedded in the model. The limited number of potential collection and recycling centers can be opened in order to produce the second-class goods. The LP-metrics method is used to consider two conflicting objectives, i.e. minimizing total losses and maximizing total environmental scores of products, simultaneously. Further, the trade-off between objectives is demonstrated by a collection of Pareto-optimal solutions. The model shows how profit and green principles can be incorporated in an APP problem. Finally, the model validity is demonstrated by a numerical example. The sensitivity analysis is carried out for GHG emission level arising from production and transportation and industrial waste level to provide some useful managerial insights, then analysis of the cost and profit in collection and recycling system, is conducted to show its performance.}

The NGO North Star Alliance aims to alleviate this situation by placing the so-called Roadside Wellness Centers (RWCs) at busy truck stops along major truck routes. Currently, locations for new RWCs are chosen so as to maximize the expected patient volume and to ensure continuity of access along the routes. As North Star’s network grows larger, the objective to provide equal access to healthcare along the different truck routes gains importance. This paper considers the problem to locate a fixed number of RWCs based on these effectiveness and equity objectives. We come up with a novel, set-partitioning type of formulation for the problem and propose a column generation algorithm to solve it. Additionally, we propose and analyze several state-of-the-art acceleration techniques, including dual stabilization, column pool management, and accelerated pricing, which solves the pricing problem as a sequence of shortest path problems. Though the facility location problem is strongly NP-hard, our algorithm yields near-optimal solutions to large randomly generated problem instances within an acceptable amount of time. We use a real life case study on the North South Corridor Network to analyze the impact of including the equity criterion into the location problem. The results show that significant improvements in terms of equity can be achieved at marginal loss in terms of North Star’s current objectives.}

abstract = {We propose a smart warehouse environment where not only inventory items but also the shelves are tracked by an RFID-based system. Both operational activities and warehouse configurations are continually monitored to facilitate real-time response. We study the dynamics of a flexible warehouse scenario where items of any type can be dropped off anywhere within the premises. Unlike existing models, we relax both the location constraint and local (e.g., item-type level) capacity constraints with a periodically renewable fixed global capacity. Dynamic decisions on location and local capacity are made based on the stochastic Markovian demand states. We optimize processing and routing constraints and compare the performance of this flexible storage setup with classical models through multiple levels of real-time decision support. Our results provide corroborating evidence to support the following observations: (1) “free pick-n-drop” combined with fluid warehousing mechanism greatly reduces trip costs and lead time for single trip demand, (2) there exists a lower bound on the performance in such a setup with fixed local capacities, and (3) the lower bound can be further improved when inventory capacity and location are dynamically adjusted according to actual demand patterns.}

abstract = {Recent decades have seen a strong increase in bioenergy utilization in Sweden, from 52 TWh in 1983 to 128 TWh in 2013. Much of this increase has been achieved by replacing fossil fuels with different forms of bioenergy in district heating. Increased use of bioenergy is generally seen as key to reducing fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions and improving energy security. However, replacing fossil fuels with solid biomass fuels in stationary heat and power generation entails significantly more complicated fuel supply logistics, with geographically scattered material associated with storage difficulties and low energy density. Given these risks and challenges and the key role of biomass-based district heating in the Swedish energy system, disturbances in fuel supply to district heating could potentially be an energy security issue. Through literature studies and interviews with employees at 18 district heating plants, we mapped present and future risks and risk management strategies in district heating supply in the Mälardalen region, south-east Sweden. We found that although small disturbances to fuel supply are not uncommon, the likelihood of heat supply failures due to fuel supply problems is low. Risk awareness is generally high among fuel supply managers, with widespread use of multilevel redundancies and diversification as key risk management strategies. However, fuel supply to plants is highly dependent on functioning truck transport and, consequently, availability of diesel fuel for trucks. Risk management can be strengthened further by implementation of forward-looking risk assessments that are less reliant on past experiences.}

Due to the importance of systematic and efficient debris removal from the perspectives of improving disaster victims quality of life and allowing the transportation of emergency relief materials, the focus of this study is on providing emergency relief supplies to disaster-affected regions as soon as possible by unblocking roads through removing the accumulated debris. We develop a mathematical model for the problem that requires long CPU times for large instances.

This research provides a systematic framework and simulation analysis for designing operations and infrastructure for modern customs and cross-border transport. A case study of the largest customs post of Thailand in terms of cargo traffic, is carried out to portray the procedural steps of the proposed approach. Literature review and in-depth interviews with associated control agencies were conducted to identify required infrastructure components, border clearance procedures and customs formality in light of the ASEAN Economic Community. Linear regression models were developed to predict the future annual volume of traveler and vehicle flow. Simulation models were constructed to justify various operations and designs of key border-crossing facilities, including immigration control booths, vehicle inspection station and truck clearance area. The principles of transport and trade facilitation were adopted to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of border crossing process. The results suggest that split configuration with joint inspections on both sides is the most practicable border control for the customs post where joint customs inspection is performed in the country of entry. To avoid unnecessary traffic interruption by different types of traffic, passenger and freight flow are separated in the design. For personal vehicles, a drive-through border crossing is proposed to allow a driver to obtain immigration and customs checks via the vehicle inspection booths without getting off the car. The analytical framework and simulation analysis proposed in this research is practical and useful for analyzing the design of other customs posts with similar traffic and cross-border patterns.}

The DDWP models an order dispatching problem faced by a distribution center, where orders arise dynamically throughout a service day and must be delivered by day’s end. At each decision epoch (wave), the system’s operator chooses whether or not to dispatch a single vehicle loaded with orders ready for service in order to minimize vehicle travel costs and penalties for unserved requests. We formulate an arc-based integer programming model and design local search heuristics to solve a deterministic DDWP where order arrival times are known in advance. We use the deterministic variant to design an a priori solution approach, and provide two approaches to obtain dynamic policies using the a priori solution. We test and compare solution approaches on two sets of instances with different geography scenarios, size, information dynamism, and order timing variability. The computational results suggest that our best dynamic policy can reduce the average cost of an a priori policy by 9.1% and substantially improves the fraction of orders delivered (order coverage), demonstrating the importance of reactive optimization for dynamic SDD services. We also analyze the tradeoff between two common SDD objectives: total cost minimization versus order coverage maximization. We find structural differences in the dispatch frequency and route duration of solutions for the two different objectives, and demonstrate empirically that small increases in order coverage may require substantial increases in vehicle travel cost.}

Here, a fully-automated sorter merges partial orders dedicated to the same customer in packing stations where, finally, the customers’ cardboard boxes are packed. For sequencing the release of bins from the ASRS we derive an elementary optimization problem, which aims to minimize the spread of orders in the release sequence so that picking orders are quickly assembled at their packing stations. The resulting problem is formalized, computational complexity is proven, and efficient solution procedures are provided. Additionally, managerial aspects are addressed with the help of a comprehensive simulation study.}

We assume that customers tolerate a certain wait and therefore the optimization criterion is the window fill rate, i.e., the expected portion of customers who are served within the tolerable wait. We develop two algorithms to solve this problem. The first algorithm (FTEA) is formula-based and is suboptimal. The second algorithm (HTEA) combines simulations into the first algorithm and obtains a higher degree of accuracy at the cost of extra running time. We characterize the near-optimal solution by its degree of pooling and concentration. Pooling happens when spares are allocated to the depot and are therefore shared by all the lower-echelon locations. Concentration takes place when spares are allocated to only a few lower-echelon locations whereas the other lower-echelon locations receive no spares. We use numerical examples to compare the algorithms and to illustrate how the budget, shipment time, local repair and customer patience affect the optimal solution and degree of pooling in varying ways. Using the numerical results, we propose a third algorithm (ETEA) that obtains HTEA’s output in 30% of the time.}

Recent technological developments connecting a platoon via digital data transmission even allow that the driver of the front truck controls all (unmanned) follower vehicles. Existing research mainly focuses on the technological and safety aspects of controlling the trucks and their distances. However, the efficiency of platooning is not only dependent on the aerodynamic drag, which considerably reduces with decreasing inter-vehicle distance; it is also influenced by the platoon formation process. To explore the impact of this and other neglected aspects on the efficiency of platooning (i.e., the diffusion of platooning technology, maximum platoon lengths, and the trucks’ willingness-to-wait for partners) a basic scheduling problem for the platoon building process along a single path is investigated. By differentiating problem characteristics, e.g., the objective function, we derive different problem settings for which a detailed analysis of computational complexity is provided. Efficient algorithms are derived and applied to explore the impact of the diffusion of platooning technology, the maximum platoon length, and the tightness of time windows. Our results show that these factors can considerably reduce the positive effects of truck platooning, and, thus, the benefit may diminish.}

abstract = {Objective
As part of its vaccine supply chain redesign efforts, Kano state now pushes vaccines directly from 6 state stores to primary health centers equipped with solar refrigerators. Our objective is to describe preliminary results from the first 20months of Kano’s direct vaccine delivery operations.
Methods
This is a retrospective review of Kano’s direct vaccine delivery program. We analyzed trends in health facility vaccine stock levels, and examined the relationship between stock-out rates and each of cascade vaccine deliveries and timeliness of deliveries. Analysis of vaccination trends was based on administrative data from 27 sentinel health facilities. Costs for both the in-sourced and out-sourced approaches were estimated using a bottoms-up model-based approach.
Results
Overall stock adequacy increased from 54% in the first delivery cycle to 68% by cycle 33. Conversely, stock-out rates decreased from 41% to 10% over the same period. Similar trends were observed in the out-sourced and in-sourced programs. Stock-out rates rose incrementally with increasing number of cascade facilities, and delays in vaccine deliveries correlated strongly with stock-out rates. Recognizing that stock availability is one of many factors contributing to vaccinations, we nonetheless compared pre- and post- direct deliveries vaccinations in sentinel facilities, and found statistically significant upward trends for 4 out of 6 antigens. 1 antigen (measles) showed an upward trend that was not statistically significant. Hepatitis b vaccinations declined during the period. Overall, there appeared to be a one-year lag between commencement of direct deliveries and the increase in number of vaccinations. Weighted average cost per delivery is US$29.8 and cost per child immunized is US$0.7 per year.
Conclusion
Direct vaccine delivery to health facilities in Kano, through a streamlined architecture, has resulted in decreased stock-outs and improved stock adequacy. Concurrent operation of insourced and outsourced programs has enabled Kano build in-house logistics capabilities.}

The approach is based on a downstream to upstream analysis of the SC and includes five phases: (1) Identifying potential markets and projected demands. (2) Determining feedstock types, locations, and available quantities. (3) Evaluation of raw material and final product transportation options, potential plant location, and logistics components that can be integrated with existing forest products SCs. (4) Cost estimation of raw material supply, production, and final product delivery. (5) Utilizing a spatially explicit optimization and generic model to determine the optimal operational conditions under which the wood pellet SC is profitable while taking into account economies of scale. The model selects the best feedstock locations and determines the optimal quantities to supply as well as the optimal production capacity. The associated ROI is calculated to assess economic feasibility. To show the value of the approach, we applied it to a real case study proposed by a regional development agency interested in developing the wood pellet sector in Eastern Canada. The results show that implementing a 100,000-tonne plant using biomass harvested in the forest as the sole feedstock is profitable. However, harvesting costs must be shared among the pellet mill and other forest companies and the government must provide financial support. The use of sawmill residues in the mix of feedstock allows implementing a highly profitable 50,000-tonne plant without any government support or harvesting cost sharing mechanism. Under a high wood pellet selling price, harvesting cost sharing and government support, the production capacity can reach 150,000tonnes/year. An important finding is that government support is not necessary for ensuring profitability in all cases. Government support has a significant impact on profitability in the case where sawmill residues are not available as a feedstock for manufacturing pellets or the selling price is high enough to allow operating a profitable plant of large size.}

This article presents a proposal to amend certain laws in order to improve the strategy of sustainable transport in urban areas in the supply of goods in the city centres. The current decisions of municipal governments are based on the administrative point of view without reference to the real needs of local business entities in the supply of goods to city centres. Therefore, it is reasonable to amend the laws for the municipal government to create decisions based on compulsory cooperation with local business operators.}

abstract = {A recent challenge faced by China is to cope with the huge amount of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) being generated all over the country. With increased pressure of environmental protection and resource conservation, laws and regulations based on extended producer responsibility (EPR) principles have been enacted by the government to promote and support for developing formal WEEE recycling enterprises. While the WEEE management system is an extensive reverse logistics system involving consumers, collectors, dismantlers, recyclers, and even EEE producers and remanufacturers, any problem in every entity may hinder the effective operation of the whole system. This paper aims to demonstrate current status of WEEE treatment and to give suggestions for improving WEEE reutilization in China, as well as provide references for countries with similar experiences as China in WEEE recycling. The actual WEEE generation, collection and recycling situation along with public awareness on WEEE treatment are investigated in Zhejiang Province, China. The survey results show that although there is consensus in the hazards of WEEE among residents, a few of them can distinguish between formal (legal) channels and informal (illegal) ones to deal with WEEE and a considerable part of populations even choose informal collection channels. Furthermore, we present a model of WEEE reverse logistics system including private trader, second-hand store, retailer adopting “Old for New” activity, classified recovery station, informal recycling enterprise, formal recycling enterprise, etc., to observe practical operation of all the entities and their inter-relations in detail. We summarize some recommendations for the government, enterprises and consumers to promote WEEE treatment more efficiently in China.}

abstract = {To reduce the negative impact of excessive traffic in large urban areas, many innovative concepts for intelligent transportation of people and freight have recently been developed. One of these concepts relies on autonomous delivery robots launched from trucks. A truck loads the freight dedicated to a set of customers in a central depot and moves into the city center. Also on board are small autonomous robots which each can be loaded with the freight dedicated to a single customer and launched from the truck. Then, the autonomous robots move to their dedicated customers and, after delivery, autonomously return to some robot depot in the city center. The truck can replenish robots at these decentralized depots to launch further of them until all its customers are supplied. To assess the potential of this innovative concept, this paper develops scheduling procedures which determine the truck route along robot depots and drop-off points where robots are launched, such that the weighted number of late customer deliveries is minimized. We formulate the resulting scheduling problem, investigate computational complexity, and develop suited solution methods. Furthermore, we benchmark the truck-based robot delivery concept with conventional attended home delivery by truck to assess the potential of this novel last-mile concept.}

Main objective of this study is to perform the first critical review of the most well known, used and cited emission calculation models and evaluate their potential use in estimation of Greenhouse Gas emissions from port truck operations. These operations, which mainly include container transport by heavy duty vehicle, are characterized by frequent stop and go motions due to traffic congestion, low speeds and heavy idling. In total, 10 models were presented, reviewed, analyzed and compared for the first time. This review showed that two of the models that appear more frequently are MOVES and COPERT, and both of them are considered appropriate for use in case on in-port operations. However, analysis also showed that these models do not include parameters that are considered crucial in cases of truck operations in port terminals, such as the effect of frequent stop and go motions due to traffic congestion resulting from waiting queues in port gates and drop-off/pick up points. Thus in order for either model to be used successfully in port truck operations, modifications are needed.}

By using a functional modeling methodology, the structural representations of the systems, in terms of activities, actions, processes, and operations, were generated and implemented by the ExtendSim® simulation software. It was shown that the models can identify the bottlenecks of the systems and can be further used as a decision support system by testing various alternatives, in terms of the resources used and their dimensioning. Finally, the models were evaluated against the sensitivity on input parameters which are known with a level of uncertainty, i.e. the expected yield and the expected machinery performance.}

However, we contend that other cost factors such as loss due to the number of en route truck stoppages based on a truck type and recovery cost associated with a route choice decision, should also be considered for deciding the fleet mix and minimizing the overall costs for long-haul shipments. The resulting non-linear model, with integer variables for the number and type of trucks, and the route choices, is solved via genetic algorithm. Using real data from a bulk liquid hazmat transporter, the trade-offs between the cost of travel, loss due to number of truck stoppages, and the long-term recovery cost associated with the risk of exposure due to a hazmat carrier accident are discussed. The numerical experiments show that when factors related to public safety and truck stoppages are taken into account for transportation, the lowest total cost and optimal route choice do not align with the cheapest truck type option; rather, the optimal solution corresponds to another truck type and route with total costs significantly less than the total costs associated with the cheapest truck type. Our model challenges the current truck purchasing strategy adopted in developing countries using the cheapest truck criteria.}

To better address this, tools of control theory and dynamic modelling should be employed. In this paper, we present a novel multi-product dynamic model inspired by an existing bond graph model for manufacturing systems, and apply a Model Predictive Controller (MPC) to steer the machines to a reference state to fulfil a given product demand. In previous related works, the capacity adjustment of the machines is based on local information only and the existing model can only represent a fixed manufacturing configuration. Thus, the contribution of this approach is twofold: it allows applying optimal control methods, generating a centralized solution based on global information; it depicts the machines as autonomous elements, enabling to represent more flexible configurations of production systems. We show in simulations that an appropriate cost function and a suitable prediction horizon length are important factors for the control of the system.}

To be successful, a firm must target price or service conscious customers using different channels based on the demand uncertainty, value, and information complexity of the product being sold. In general, the physical channel should be used to serve frequent and predictable needs in a cost effective manner. The online channel should be used to provide variety and serve sporadic needs at low cost. The physical channel can also serve as a showroom and pickup location for the online channel to improve customer service and decrease cost.}

This unique inventory-location problem involves demand and supply uncertainties, coverage radius limitations, service level requirements, and multiple products consideration. Each retailer has two classes of products flowing from the assigned DC due to demands minus donations occurring in that retailer. The proposed model simultaneously determines the number of DCs to open, DC locations, and assignments of retailers to the open DCs for particular product types. The objective is to minimize the total annual cost including: facility location costs, transportation costs, inventory costs, and the lost sale costs. Due to the complexity of the problem, the proposed model structure allows for relaxing complicating constraints through recourse to Lagrangian relaxation. The use of robust branch-cut and price heuristics solves the mixed integer nonlinear problem to obtain a lower bound and a distance-based heuristic to get an upper bound. We formulate essential features of this novel problem, solve several numerical example problems and evaluate solution performance. We believe this is a novel problem environment, and that this initial study extends integrated location-inventory modeling to a new context.}

The HVLP–FVL maximizes the total profit of a vehicle fleet where different models of finished vehicles result in different profits and routing costs are considered based on distance traveled. Addressing the vehicle structures, simplified geometric models of both the finished vehicle and transport vehicle are defined. The optimization considers which finished vehicle orders to transport and then makes the loading assignment to the transport vehicles. To improve the computational performance of the traditional branch and bound algorithm, an enhancement using greedy search based on oscillation analysis is proposed. A real case study is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the improved algorithm and a series of experiments are conducted over a set of finished vehicle loading problems. The results demonstrate the proposed approach has superior performance and satisfies users in practice. Contributions of the paper are the modeling and solving of a real complex problem in vehicle manufacturing logistics and a simple branch-and-bound speed up that could be used in other problem classes.}

In many countries, the average employment rate of people aged 55 to 64 years increased over 7 percentage points in the decade. But large trucks which serve a vital function in JIT delivery in global supply chains, are a disadvantage in terms of safety and exact timing. It is also important to note that older drivers are more vulnerable to serious injury and death in the event of a traffic crash due to changes in physiology associated with normal aging. Vision, cognition, and motor functions like flexibility, strength, and coordination, are required for safe and not delayed driving, but they are part of overall declining of functional capacities after the 50s. To solve this problem, we should put in place the early retirement of the occupational pension schemes, in which higher retirement age will not affect the reliability of logistic and therefore will not influence the ripple effect of the total logistic network. This paper is introducing an actuarial evaluation of optimal retirement age and related economically acceptable contribution rate to the occupational pension scheme for drivers regarding exposure to the risk of the total chain The model is based on actuarial mathematics for pension insurance. Therefore, the Net Present Value (NPV) is calculated in the extended MRP model to evaluate delays and disruptions caused by ageing. The output of the research is therefore the model which can be used as a basis for negotiations between employers and unions to keep the transportation and other logistics activities at the same level of quality. It also enables to develop the flexible occupational- truck drivers retirement schemes. In this paper the model for evaluation of delays in transport caused by older drivers only is given as a new solution to be able to compare with actuarial present value of early pension contributions for drivers.}

This paper aims at developing a decision making model for inventory management of perishable goods for long term humanitarian operations, using Markov Decision Process. Our model allows managers to ensure that the goods in the inventory are proper for consumption without necessarily keeping track of individual expiration dates for each item in the inventory.

abstract = {The green vehicle routing and scheduling problem (GVRSP) aims to minimize green-house gas emissions in logistics systems through better planning of deliveries/pickups made by a fleet of vehicles. We define a new mixed integer liner programming (MIP) model which considers heterogeneous vehicles, time-varying traffic congestion, customer/vehicle time window constraints, the impact of vehicle loads on emissions, and vehicle capacity/range constraints in the GVRSP. The proposed model allows vehicles to stop on arcs, which is shown to reduce emissions up to additional 8% on simulated data. A hybrid algorithm of MIP and iterated neighborhood search is proposed to solve the problem.}

Useful insights are generated by analyzing and prioritizing all dimensions for locating shelter sites. Results reveal that favourability of terrain, community infrastructure, transportation infrastructure and type of ownership have a strong influence on other factors. There is a need to place a deep focus on topography and slope of terrain as well as on the presence of flora and fauna. Moreover, the extent of damage to community infrastructure and transportation network significantly impacts decisions of locating shelter sites and relocating affected population to them in case of destructive natural hazards like earthquakes, hurricanes, etc. The findings of the study in terms of contextual relationships can substantially contribute towards policy formation for an effective shelter location planning.}

abstract = {Recent environmental considerations as well as advancements in the field of logistics have promoted the integration of the forward and reverse supply chains, in order to increase operational efficiency and support sustainable operations. In light of this, we formulate a mixed integer non-linear program (MINLP) that describes both the forward and reverse flow of a single type of product, through a set of warehouses whose location is determined based on whether they serve as forward, reverse or joint warehouses dealing with products from both directions. The objective of the model is to minimize the total costs, which include fixed location, fixed ordering, inventory holding, transportation as well as re-processing costs, the latter referring to returned products. In order to overcome the non-linearity of the formulation, the respective constraints are linearized, while for the non-linear terms of the objective function a piecewise linearization is proposed. The computational analysis focuses on comparing the results obtained by solving the MINLP in commercial software with the results obtained from implementing the linearization for a different number of adopted segments for the piecewise linearization. In addition, both integrated approaches are compared to the sequential approach, according to which the location, ordering and transportation problems are initially solved, producing an output that is subsequently used as an input to solve the inventory problem. Results demonstrate the benefits of integration as well as the cost savings that can be achieved due to the closed loop consideration of the supply chain. A discussion of these results produces useful insights for supply chain operators.}

abstract = {In the considered automated container terminal (ACT) that is designed for Shanghai Yangsha Terminal, two automated stacking cranes (ASCs) are configured for each block and they interact with automated lifting vehicles (ALVs) at the two ends of a block individually. To increase the capacity, container yards with multiple rows of blocks perpendicular to the terminal’s shoreline are considered. To utilize the yard spaces, the twin ASCs are devised to share the same tracks installed at the two sides of a block, while interferences between the ASCs challenge the routing and sequencing operations. To isolate the control and simplify the coordination of the two ASCs, the interference between ASCs is formulated by analyzing the minimal temporal intervals between any two tasks. Three models are then established to sequence the container handling tasks under the minimization of the makespan. An exact algorithm and a genetic algorithm are designed to solve the problem. Numerical experiments show that the algorithms are competitive comparing to on-the-shelf solvers. Practical implications are investigated based on the formulations and experimental results. The managerial implications and technological aspects of applying the formulations and algorithms to practical situations to real-world ACTs are discussed.}

The key focus is on improving seaside processes, where a distinction can be made between single quay crane operations (all quay cranes are either loading or unloading containers) and overlapping quay crane operations (some quay cranes are loading while others are unloading containers). Using a network of open and semi-open queues, we develop a new integrated stochastic model for analyzing the performance of overlapping loading and unloading operations that capture the complex stochastic interactions among quayside, vehicle, and stackside processes. The analytical model is solved using an iterative algorithm based on the parametric decomposition approximation approach. The system performance is tested at varying container traffic levels. We find that the percent absolute errors in throughput times compared to simulation are less than 10% for all cases. Using these integrated models, we are able to generate design insights and also rapidly analyze what-if scenarios. For example, we show that the best yard layout configurations for single (either loading or unloading) operations and the best for overlapping (both loading and unloading) operations largely overlap. The best configurations have relatively few stack blocks and many rows per block. The model is generic and amenable to obtain other design and operational performance insights.}

Balancing human and material resources during these situations is not a trivial issue, and that is further complicated by the participation of several actors at multiple periods. However, there is an absence of articles considering the importance of deploying only the required organisations for response activities depending on the conditions and the stage of the disaster. This research proposes a dynamic model to support disaster response which incorporates human and material resources from multiple organisations. The multi-modal, multi-commodity optimisation model supports resource allocation and relief distribution decisions through the maximisation of the level of service provided to disaster victims and the minimisation of cost. The model is the first dynamic formulation in the literature with the ability to optimise the number, type and stage of deployment of organisations required according to the circumstances of the emergency. The model has been applied to two major floods that have occurred in Mexico in recent years. Each case was tested using three different scenarios to investigate the ability of the model to handle different conditions. The results of both cases were compared to scenarios with independent participation from each organisation and an instance capturing the real decisions made by Mexican authorities. The results showed the inefficiency stemming from independent decision-making, an excess of actors involved in the real instances of both cases, the applicability of the model to different circumstances, and the value of the ability to modify the number of organisations involved per stage.}

abstract = {Over the last two decades, many companies in developed countries have considered reverse logistics as an important process in their supply chain. This stem from the fact that useless materials may be worthwhile and they can re-enter in the supply chain with relatively minor modifications. Specifically, in case of citrus supply chains, the spoiled fruits in each echelon of the chain are one of the main concerns for decision makers in both private and public sectors. Therefore, this paper aims at minimizing costs of citrus closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) and maximizing responsiveness to customers' demand in each sector (forward and reverse). In order to achieve the research objectives, a new mathematical model for a citrus closed-loop supply chain is developed and also a multi-objective Keshtel algorithm (MOKA) is firstly proposed as a solution method. The proposed method is compared with the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II), the non-dominated ranking genetic algorithm (NRGA), and multi-objective simulated annealing (MOSA) to illustrate the performance of the proposed MOKA. In addition, a hybrid MCDM technique is proposed for selecting the best algorithm. In order to demonstrate the applicability of our study, a case study of a citrus closed-loop supply chain in northern Iran is presented. The results of the analysis and the case study show that the proposed model and solution method are promising.}

These problems can be modeled as two-agent scheduling problems with generalized due dates. In particular we consider two environments: single-machine and the proportionate flow shop. Two objectives are considered: The first objective is to minimize one agent's performance measure with a constraint on the other agent's one, while the second objective is to minimize the weighted sum of the performance measures of two agents. The performance measures introduced in this paper are the maximum tardiness, the total tardiness, and the total number of tardy jobs. We show that under both machine environments, the case with the first objective is weakly NP-hard when the performance measures of two agents are the total tardiness, while the other cases are polynomially solvable.}

The growing demand for deliveries in urban areas involves increases in traffic and congestion problems and, consequently, environmental issues. In recent years, many studies have focused on alternative measures to reduce the negative aspects and impact of last-mile deliveries. Good practice to rationalize last-mile delivery should involve the use of various systems, such as reception boxes, delivery boxes, controlled access systems, collection points and lockers. This paper compares two alternative options to home delivery.

Therefore, developing a model for locating distribution centers and relief goods distribution systems in disaster times, along with appropriately locating health centers with the ease of access for transferring the casualties and saving their lives, is among the most essential concerns in relief logistics. Considering these two subjects, simultaneously, results in an increase in the quality of service in disaster zones. In this study, a multi-objective programming model is developed for locating relief goods distribution centers and health centers along with distributing relief goods and transferring the casualties to health centers, with pre/post-disaster budget constraints for goods and casualties logistics. For a better modelling of the reality, the uncertainties in demand, supply, and cost parameters are included in the model. Also, facility failure (e.g. relief distribution centers, health centers, hospitals and supply points failure) due to earthquakes is considered. The proposed model maximizes the response level to medical needs of the casualties, while targeting the justly distribution of relief goods and minimizing the total costs of preparedness and response phases. In order to handle the uncertainties, the robust optimization approach is utilized. The model is solved with ε – constraint method. For the large sized form, the MOGASA algorithm is proposed, and the results are compared to those of the NSGAII algorithm. Then the validity and efficiency of the proposed algorithm is explored based on the results of both the proposed and exact methods.}

abstract = {This paper reviews the logistics challenges of a decentralization strategy in Singapore. The main purpose of an urban decentralization, where the commercial hubs and retail clusters are distributed in several regional centers is to relieve congestion from the city center and to move business closer to home. However, this approach can also create congestion in regional centers due to the rapid flow of public, private and freight vehicles in and out of regional centers. This paper identifies three major challenges and proposes Retail Precinct Management (RPM) which consists of four inter-related components to overcome these challenges.}

abstract = {Distribution activities arising from supply-chains of chemical and food industries involve the shipping of products directly and/or via distribution-centers. Also, due to growing ecology concerns, the recycling of recoverable-materials is becoming a common practice. In this paper, a distribution and recovering problem has been studied and modeled. The solution to the problem-model computes the forward and backward flows on a supply-chain network of a company that take into account ‘green logistics’ considerations. In this problem, vehicles departing from plants/distribution-centers perform delivery of products and pick-up of recyclables at the lowest network-level. At a higher level, larger vehicles re-supply distribution-centers with products and bring back to plants recyclable goods. The operation must coordinate the vehicles-tours to assure efficient forward and backwards flows. The paper presents a column-generation based decomposition-approach for finding near-optimal solutions to the problem. We also present computational results on test problems derived from a real case-study.}

Biomass from animal waste such as horse manure has unutilized potential as it has yet to be implemented at a large scale as an energy source. Research has demonstrated the technical feasibility of using animal waste for energy conversion, though their supply chain cost poses a barrier, as does a gap in research regarding the specific design of efficient horse manure-to-energy supply chains. In response, we investigated the design of horse manure-to-energy supply chains through interviews and site visits at stables, as well as through interviews with transport companies. Our findings show that horse manure-to-energy supply chains have distinct attributes at all stages of the supply chain such as the geographical spread of stables that determines supply chain design and hampers efficiency. They share several such attributes with forest biomass-to-energy supply chains, from which important needs can be identified, including the industrial development of trucks dedicated to the purpose, mathematical modeling to handle the trade-off of cost of substance loss in storage and cost of transport, and business models that reconcile the conflicting goals of different actors along the supply chains.}

In particular, the road segments and the population points to perform assessment activities on are selected based on the value they add to the consecutive response operations. To this end, we develop a bi-objective mathematical model that provides damage information in the affected region by considering both the importance of population centers and road segments on the transportation network through using aerial and ground vehicles (drones and motorcycles). The first objective aims to maximize the total value added by the assessment of the road segments (arcs) whereas the second maximizes the total profit generated by assessing points of interests (nodes). Bi-objectivity of the problem is studied with the ϵ-constraint method. Since obtaining solutions as fast as possible is crucial in the post-disaster condition, heuristic methods are also proposed. To test the mathematical model and the heuristic methods, a data set belonging to Kartal district of Istanbul is used. Computational experiments demonstrate that the use of drones in post-disaster assessment contributes to the assessment of a larger area due to its angular point of view. Also, the proposed heuristic methods not only can find a high-quality approximation of the Pareto front but also mitigates the solution time difficulties of the mathematical model.}

This problem is different from the better known vehicle routing problem with time windows because in the former the vehicles do not return to the distribution depot after delivering the goods to the customers. For solving this problem an iterated local search algorithm was used, whose good results are mainly due to the kind of perturbations applied, in particular, ejection chains, and also to the use of elite solutions. The performance of this algorithm is tested using a large set of benchmark problems, containing 418 instances in total. The solutions obtained show that it is competitive with the best algorithms existing in the literature.}

Road network accessibility becomes an important issue for logistic operations, specially on the first days after the quake, when the relief distribution is crucial for survival. This study focused on the Road Emergency Rehabilitation Problem, divided into the Road Network Accessibility Problem (RNAP) and the Work-troops Scheduling Problem (WSP). The first one consists in finding traversable paths for relief teams to reach the population, and the later generates a repairing schedule to improve access to refugee areas. The contributions of this study are two-fold: we present the process of transcribing satellite imagery data into graphs, and mathematical formulations for the RNAP and WSP, along with heuristics to solve the WSP. The proposed methods are able to handle large-scale graphs in an acceptable running time for real scenarios. They are tested on simulated instances and on the graph of Port-au-Prince, with more than 10,000 vertices and edges. The Port-au-Prince graph was generated from satellite images obtained by the International Charter “Space and Major Disasters” a few hours after the 2010 earthquake.}

The objective of this paper is to assess sustainability and prioritise system alternatives for potential implementation in the metropolitan region of Rio de Janeiro. Sustainability criteria and decision alternatives were defined by elicitation of stakeholders. The adopted multicriteria approach combines Life Cycle Assessment with qualitative evaluations by a small sample of regional experts with knowledge of the problem. The recommended system consists of a hybrid WEEE collection scheme with delivery points at shops, metro stations and neighbourhood centres; a pre-treatment phase with the involvement of private companies, cooperatives and social enterprises; and full recycling of all components in the country.}

A mixed integer linear programming model is proposed to optimize the paper and cardboard recycling network, and a robust optimization approach is utilized to deal with demand uncertainty in this network. The model maximizes the total profit. It considers the operation, transportation, purchasing and holding inventory costs as well. Moreover, to illustrate the application of the proposed model, a real-world cardboard closed-loop supply chain design is investigated. The proposed model considers the option to open a new recycling center in the current network. The proposed model determines the optimal quantities of the waste paper, paper, sheet and cardboard that flow in this network. Finally, the computational analysis indicated that the proposed model provides efficient solutions for the studied cardboard closed-loop network.}

With this framework and model, we gain insights into network transportation costs and investigate possible service expansion scenarios faced by these organizations. We solve a vehicle routing problem (VRP) formulated for the residential neighborhood context using a heuristic approach developed. The scenarios considered follow a narrative where service providers start with an initial neighborhood or community and expands to incorporate other communities and their households. The results indicate that increasing household participation, decreases the travel time and cost per household, up to a critical threshold, beyond which we see marginal time and cost improvements. Additionally, the results indicate different outcomes in expansion scenarios depending on the household density of incorporated neighborhoods. As household participation and density increases, the travel time per household in the network decreases. However, at approximately 10–20 households per km2, the decrease in travel time per household is marginal, suggesting a lowerbound household density threshold. Finally, we show in food waste collection, networks share common scaling effects with respect to travel time and costs, regardless of the number of nodes and links.}

The two-echelon vehicle routing problem and the two-echelon location routing problem seek to produce vehicle itineraries to deliver goods to customers, with transits through intermediate facilities. To efficiently solve these problems, we propose a hybrid metaheuristic which combines enumerative local searches with destroy-and-repair principles, as well as some tailored operators to optimise the selections of intermediate facilities. We conduct extensive computational experiments to investigate the contribution of these operators to the search performance, and measure the performance of the method on both problem classes. The proposed algorithm finds the current best known solutions, or better ones, for 95% of the two-echelon vehicle routing problem benchmark instances. Overall, for both problems, it achieves high-quality solutions within short computing times. Finally, for future reference, we resolve inconsistencies between different versions of benchmark instances, document their differences, and provide them all online in a unified format.}

In contrast to the traditional humanitarian logistics literature, we develop a chance-constrained two-stage mean-risk stochastic programming model. This risk-averse model features a mean-risk objective, where the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) is specified as the risk measure, and enforces a joint probabilistic constraint on the feasibility of the second-stage problem concerned with distributing the relief supplies to the affected areas in case of a disaster. To solve this computationally challenging stochastic optimization model, we employ an exact Benders decomposition-based branch-and-cut algorithm. We develop three variants of the proposed algorithm by using alternative representations of CVaR. We illustrate the application of our model and solution methods on a case study concerning the threat of hurricanes in the Southeastern part of the United States. An extensive computational study provides practical insights about the proposed modeling approach and demonstrates the computational effectiveness of the solution framework.}

In this paper, we consider time access restriction related to specific vehicle types (i.e. the time-windows during which the access to the area of delivery is allowed depends upon the characteristics of the vehicles). Thus, we aim to discuss the impact of these restrictions on the fleet composition decision. To this end, we introduce a simple, tactical oriented optimization model, which trades off the different costs and revenues in delivering goods.}
