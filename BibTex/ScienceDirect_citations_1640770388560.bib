abstract = {Drill-core analysis is paramount for the characterization of deposits in mineral exploration. Over the past years, the use of hyperspectral (HS) sensors has rapidly increased to improve the reliability and efficiency of core logging. However, scanning drill-core samples of an entire mineral deposit entails several complex challenges, from transport logistics to large scale data management and analysis. Hence, academic studies on new applications of drill-core HS data at a mineral deposit scale remain rare. We present a semi-automated workflow for large scale interpretation of HS data, founded on a novel approach of mineral mapping based on a supervised dictionary learning technique. This approach exploits the complementary information from scanning electron microscopy based automated mineralogy and hyperspectral imaging techniques for estimating mineral quantities along all boreholes. We propose that it is effectively possible to propagate the mineral quantification to the entire borehole from small samples with high resolution mineralogical information strategically selected throughout the deposit. We showcase this approach on data acquired in the Elvira shale-hosted volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) deposit located at the Iberian Pyrite Belt (IPB), where 7000 m of drill-core were acquired along 80 boreholes. Resulting maps provide insights on the controls on the mineral assemblages and chemical composition of specific minerals across the whole volume at several spatial scales, from large scale variations within apparently homogeneous black shales to small scale mineral composition variations, of potential use as vectors towards mineralization. This approach adds value to the core data, allowing for a better understanding of the geological setting of the Elvira deposit and providing valuable insights for future exploration targeting in the region. This approach based on machine learning can easily be transposed to different ore deposits with a limited input from a geologist.}

abstract = {With the increasing complexity of decision-making problems and environment, the integration and fusion of three-way decisions, rough set and multi-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) have become a major trend in the field of decision analysis. Although many researchers have presented various MAGDM methods under different environments, there are still some imperfections, such as the weight information is not comprehensive or flexible enough, the decision results lack interpretability, and the impact of risk attitude is not fully taken into account. In order to overcome the above shortcomings and improve the scientificity and rationality of decision-making, a novel data-driven MAGDM method under interval-valued intuitionistic uncertain linguistic environment is established based on the idea of multi-granulation and three-way decisions. Our contributions can be identified as follows: (1) The multi-granulation weight mining and fusion methods for experts and attributes are proposed, respectively; (2) The coarse-granulation grading information based on three-way decisions is developed to enhance the interpretability and reference value of decision results; (3) The expected value with risk attitude factor is defined to compare interval-valued intuitionistic uncertain linguistic variables (IVIULVs) and then is used to grade and rank alternatives under different risk attitudes. To illustrate the feasibility and practicality of the proposed method, a case of logistics supplier selection in e-commerce enterprises is demonstrated. Furthermore, the advantages and characteristics of the proposed method are highlighted via detailed comparison and thorough analysis.}

abstract = {Faced with high return rates, many e-commerce retailers are considering novel technical solutions to expedite the processing of returned items in their warehouses. One such solution consists of lane-guided transport (LGT) vehicles. These small, electric vehicles follow optical markers on the floor, picking up boxes of returned items at a depot and dropping them off at workstations, releasing the logistics workers to focus on the productive task of actually processing the items instead of carrying them through the warehouse. These types of systems are simple to set up from a technical perspective; however, the routes on the warehouse floor still need to be carefully planned. This gives rise to the following routing problem. Given a set of stations to be served from multiple depots by a fleet of LGT vehicles, which stations doing what type of work should be visited on what route? Only one route per depot is allowed, but multiple vehicles may use the same route. Moreover, since routes cannot be changed on short notice, we consider an infinite planning horizon where the demand rate of the stations depends on the type of work they are assigned to do (e.g., handling defective items or refurbishing). We develop a decomposition heuristic, which solves instances derived from industry data to near-optimality in less than a minute. We also show that the depot location is rather unimportant for the overall system performance, but that the depot count can have a significant influence.}

It was applied a structured interview, with a questionnaire structured and applied to a random sample of 370 companies from the industrial sector consumers of fluorescent lamps. The results showed that the common waste is still the predominant disposal option, many respondents are not aware of the environmental legislation, and the industries also pointed out that there are many difficulties to implement reverse logistics mainly due to the absence of public power programs for the correct disposal. Therefore, there is a lack of government support and companies' initiative to comply with the legislation, which is bad considering it is a hazardous waste.}

Traceability and trackability of data ensure the compliance of airworthiness requirements. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has strongly emphasised the significance of quality traceability data throughout the aircraft part’s life cycle, leading to enhanced inventory control accuracy, reduced maintenance error, and effective decision-making processes. However, with the rapid increase of spare parts types, the complexity of aircraft parts multi-stage supply chains leads to inefficient tracing and tracking operations with unsatisfactory traceability data quality and information security. This paper proposed a blockchain-based system that provided a managerial platform for accurate recording of spare parts traceability data with organisational consensus and validation using Hyperledger Fabric and Hyperledger Composer. A data model has been determined based on the existing ASPM, enabling information integrity during transaction operations. The channel mechanism has yielded a trustful data sharing platform between each contracting organisation for logistics and operational arrangements, which has enhanced information visibility and security. The blockchain-based system, executed under a decentralised ledger mechanism, shall improve the quality of traceability data and reliable information sharing within the spare parts supply chain. The enhanced blockchain-based inventory management system can establish the digital twin of aviation as part of Industry 4.0 in the future.}

Maximal population impact, including through herd immunity, requires high vaccination coverage. However, protection of unvaccinated women requires secondary prevention through cytology screening. Unfortunately in countries with the highest incidence/mortality due to cervical cancer HPV vaccination (or cytology screening) is not sufficiently available. Vaccination programme costs and a lack of accessibility of the populations for immunization remain significant hurdles. Several approaches could increase effective implementation of HPV vaccination. 1) Use of a single immunization of the current VLP vaccines. 2) Vaccination bundled with other paediatric vaccines with lower dosage to facilitate delivery, improve coverage and reduce costs through established logistics. 3) Local manufacture with lower cost systems (e.g. bacteria) for VLP or capsomer based vaccine production and utilization of additional protective epitopes (e.g L2) for increasing breadth of protection. However, all the latter need appropriate clinical validation. Gender neutral vaccination and extending routine vaccination strategies to women up to age 30 years in combination with at least one HPV screening test can also hasten impact on cancer incidence.}

A central administrator appointed by the government manages and maintains the security of each node. Smart City relies upon millions of sensors that are heterogeneous and do not support standard security architecture. Different manufacturers have weak protection protocols for their products and do not update their firmware upon newly identified operating systems’ vulnerabilities. Adversaries using brute force methods exploit the lack of inbuilt security systems on IoT devices to grow their bot network. Smart cities require a standard framework combining soft computing and Deep Learning (DL) for device fleet management and complete control of sensor operating systems for absolute security. This paper presents a real-world application for IoT fleet management security using a lightweight container-based botnet detection (C-BotDet) framework. Using a three-phase approach, the framework using Artificial Intelligence detects compromised IoT devices sending malicious traffic on the network. Balena Cloud revokes API keys and prevents a compromised device from infecting other devices to form a more giant botnet. VPN (Virtual Private Network) prevents inter-device communication and routes all malicious traffic through an external server. The framework quickly updates the standard Linux-based operating system IoT device fleet without relying on different manufacturers to update their system security individually. The simulation and analysis of the C-BotDet framework are presented in a practical working environment to demonstrate its implementation feasibility.}

It is distinguished between nine different in-field routing tasks: two for full-field coverage, seven for partial-field coverage and one for shortest path planning between any two vertices of the transition graph. It differentiates between equal or different start and end vertices for a task, coverage of only a subset of vertices, and a subset of edges or combinations. The proposed methods are developed primarily for applying sprays and fertilisers with larger operating widths and with fields where there is unique headland path. Partial field coverage where, e.g., only a specific subset of edges has to be covered is relevant for precision agriculture and also for optimised logistical operation of smaller-sized machinery with limited loading capacities. The result of this research is the proposition of two compatible algorithms for optimal full and partial field coverage path planning, respectively. These are evaluated on three real-world fields to demonstrate their characteristics and computational efficiency.}

Medication discrepancies at transitions of care may compromise patient safety. Trained pharmacy technicians can reduce harmful medication discrepancies at transitions of care by collecting medication histories.
Objective
We describe how to create a program integrating medication history technicians (MHTs) into the hospital discharge process using implementation science.
Practice description
We created our MHT program at a Veterans Affairs (VA) hospital.
Practice innovation
We used an evidence-based framework and implementation science to tailor our MHT program to meet local stakeholder needs.
Evaluation methods
We completed a literature review and review of current discharge practices. Then, we completed a workflow pilot, a needs assessment, and semistructured interviews with pharmacy technicians and pharmacists. We integrated these findings to identify barriers of MHT program implementation. Finally, we mapped these barriers to implementation strategies to create an MHT program implementation blueprint.
Results
The literature review and review of current discharge practices revealed opportunities for our program to reduce medication discrepancies. We applied these findings to our proof-of-concept workflow pilot, which reduced medication discrepancy rates at discharge. When we explored barriers in the needs assessment, we learned that 4 of 6 pharmacy technicians had some training conducting medication histories, but 5 of 6 requested additional training for the new MHT role. We explored these and additional barriers in semistructured interviews. Four themes emerged: elements of pharmacy technician training, challenges to implementation, program logistics and workflow, and pharmacy technician self-efficacy. We mapped barriers to implementation strategies to create an MHT program implementation blueprint, including developing pharmacy technician training materials, modifying our workflow, creating program evaluation materials, and strategizing how to overcome anticipated and current implementation barriers.
Conclusions
We used implementation science to create a tailored MHT program. Others may adapt our implementation blueprint to fit local stakeholder needs.}

This paper describes and classifies the sustainability connotation of sharing economy platforms. It analyses 121 platforms derived through social media analytics to figure out whether they describe themselves as sustainable. The findings suggest that the sustainability connotation closely connects to specific sectors such as fashion, on-demand services and logistics. Meanwhile, the dominant role model platforms do not communicate about being sustainable. These findings contribute to previous research through (1) giving a systematic empirical account on the way various sharing economy platforms describe themselves in terms of sustainability, (2) pointing out the differences among the platforms, and (3) indicating the diversity in sustainability connotation among various sectors of the economy.}

In this study, we have synthesized copolymers of N-vinylcaprolactam (Vcap) with N-acryloyl type comonomers and investigated their ability to inhibit the formation of structure-I type gas hydrates under sour environment. Vcap was successfully copolymerized with N-acryloylmorpholine, N-acryloylpyrrolidine, N-Isopropylacrylamide and N-acryloylpiperidine to form a series of low molecular weight copolymers. The compatibility of these copolymers was investigated using cloud point temperature and fouling tests. The performance of all copolymers as KHIs was evaluated with high-pressure rocking cells using a structure-I forming natural gas mixture at 130–140 bar. It was found that KHI performance of copolymers in terms of subcooling temperature exceeded that of the P(Vcap) homopolymer of similar molecular weight. Furthermore, the comonomer with cyclic pendant groups with one heteroatom resulted in a better performance compared to acyclic and cyclic pendant groups with a higher number of heteroatoms. Also, the KHI performance of copolymers increased significantly at higher ratios of acryloyl monomer relative to Vcap. These results describe a facile method to design and develop new copolymers of Vcap as effective KHIs for structure-I type hydrates formed under sour environments.}

These characteristics along with their wide availability make the TV white spaces a great choice and alternative to many existing wireless technologies, especially the ones that need long range and high bandwidth communication. In the last decade, there have been numerous efforts from academia, industries, and standards bodies for exploiting the potentials of the TV white spaces for several applications including wireless broadband Internet access. Their characteristics and features also hold potentials for many new applications including sensing and monitoring, Internet of Things, wireless control, smart utility, location-based services, and transportation and logistics.

Additionally, we discuss the associated research challenges such as dealing with the interference between primary and secondary TV spectrum users, TV white space temporal and spatial variations and fragmentation, antenna design, mobility, and security.

Moreover, the total trip expenses increases about 15% due to the delays at check-posts by Transport Department and Traffic Police, toll plazas etc. The working conditions of truck drivers also deteriorate as they work for long hours, resulting in high stress and fatigue leading to accidents. The need is recognized for collaboration amongst stakeholders to identify optimal freight policies and pursue a rapid deployment of improvements. In this direction, creating better data and models are needed to enable planners to better predict freight movement and design better informed policies. In the present study, the freight transport data has been exhaustively collected to assess the urban freight characteristics of Delhi. For this purpose, the field surveys namely outer cordon traffic surveys at 10 locations and focal point survey at 20 locations within the city have been conducted. The results can make a good database to understand the freight characteristics of a city and it would be highly useful in developing freight travel demand models and also evaluate appropriate freight related transport policies for their effective implementation on the urban road network by the policy makers and concerned authorities.}

Here, we present a way to charge the Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carrier (LOHC) dibenzyltoluene (H0-DBT) with industrially relevant, CO2- and CO-containing gas mixtures. As only hydrogen binds to the hydrogen-lean carrier molecule, this process step extracts hydrogen from the gas mixture and binds it selectively to the carrier. Pd on alumina has been identified as the most promising catalyst system for successfully hydrogenating H0-DBT using model gas mixtures resembling the compositions produced in methane reforming and in industrial coke production (up to 50% CO2 and 7% CO). Up to 80% of the hydrogen present in the feedstock mixture could be extracted during the LOHC hydrogenation process. 99.5% of the reacting hydrogen was selectively bound to the H0-DBT LOHC compound. The purity of hydrogen released from the resulting perhydro dibenzyltoluene previously charged with the hydrogen-rich gas mixture proved to be up to 99.99 mol%.}

abstract = {The pavement engineering community has consistently drawn its attention to a broadened utilization of advanced Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) systems for pavement evaluation. Amongst these systems, the Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) is designed to measure surface deflections and assess the pavement structural condition, while Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is utilized to estimate pavement layers’ thicknesses. An integration of the capabilities of these two separate systems has been considered a powerful resource in pavement evaluation. With this in mind, the present study aims to investigate whether this integration could result in the utilization of the derived FWD deflection data to directly assess pavement layers thicknesses. For the research, an integrated regression analysis is conducted considering both GPR and FWD data with the aim to develop a relationship between GPR-estimated AC thicknesses and FWD deflection indexes. The developed relationship is calibrated considering both GPR and core thicknesses and further validated yielding an equivalent and satisfactory performance, with thickness prediction errors around 10%. This finding produces evidence in support of the statement that deflection data is capable of roughly producing pavement layer thicknesses. Such an approach could suggest a practical and cost-effective pavement evaluation tool, when the procurement and transportation logistics of implementing multiple and expensive equipment may be a critical issue.}

abstract = {Smart logistics is a part of Industry 4.0. With the increased development of the technology in the vehicle industry, the machine learning algorithms are applied on sensor data in order to detect the failure of the components of the vehicle. Several systems for vehicle health monitoring are presented in the literature for delivery of services in real-time. The sensor values obtained from the cloud are processed with machine learning algorithms, but have problem with delay in execution and data center failure. Edge computing is introduced in recent years so that intensive operations are performed at the edge of the device than at the cloud. This paper presents edge computing based fault prediction system that will predict vehicle health using internal and external sensors in real-time. Risk details are displayed through a mobile application in the form of notifications as well as a dashboard at the terminal. Such a system reduces latency between sending and processing vehicle data. The proposed system uses ensemble of ANN and k-NN classifiers named as AK-NN so as to improve prediction performance. In the first step, ANN is trained and validated on the Chevrolet car OBD dataset. Error reported from this best trained network is used by k-NN for statistical analysis of the error distributions. Three different experiments based on ANN, k-NN and AK-NN are made and evaluated using NRMSE, COD, cross entropy loss, accuracy and ROC measures. 85% accuracy for k-NN model when k = 3, 78% accuracy using ANN and 98.7% for ensemble method are achieved. Comparative study using key performance indicators such as Mean time between failure (MTBF) and Mean time to Repair (MTTR) is also made on 84 vehicles for prediction alert over mobile phone using analytical dashboard and proved to reach availability objective.}

Today, 2D LIDARs are used as range sensors, and 3D LIDARs are becoming widespread with the developments of autonomous vehicle technology. Therefore, Self Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization, abbreviated as SA-MCL, is improved in this study to make the algorithm suitable for autonomous guided vehicles (AGVs) equipped with 2D or 3D LIDARs. Moreover, the traditional SA-MCL algorithm has a constraint that the range sensors on the robot are uniformly placed, and ellipse based energy model is proposed in this study to remove the constraint. This model can compute the energy value regardless of the robot orientation since it considers offsets due to the asymmetric placement of range sensors on the robot. The importance of localization increases since it is aimed that AGVs to be used in smart factories are able to use entire free space on the map in order to provide energy efficiency and time saving, and perform tasks that can vary at anytime instead of routine. SA-MCL algorithm is preferred in this study since traditional SA-MCL can overcome global localization, position tracking and kidnapping sub-problems of localization. The algorithm proposed in this study is verified to demonstrate its performance and effectiveness both in simulation and experimental studies using MATLAB and robot operating system (ROS).}

New methodologies to extend the useful life of products have long been sought, accelerating the shift from a linear to a Circular Economy (CE). When products reach the End-of-Life (EoL) stage, the Reverse Supply Chain (RSC) is responsible for managing operations, with greater efforts being needed to improve the associated information infrastructure. In fact, this has become increasingly feasible due to the emergence of a new digital revolution led by the Internet of Things (IoT). To shed light on this matter, we propose the Circular Supply Chain (CSC) framework for EoL management aimed at satisfying the information infrastructure requirements in a particular scenario for the recovery of Electric Vehicle Battery (EVB) packs. We present a qualitative evaluation of the CSC information requirements, and the capabilities of IoT to satisfy them. As a result, a heterogeneous IoT network deployment is proposed in pursuit of a digital CSC information infrastructure.}

abstract = {Big promotions of online retailers in different shopping festivals often lead to an overwhelming demand surge in parcel delivery. Besides using its own distribution capacity, online retailers usually adopt capacity sharing to cope with the demand surge. Because of the low cost of unmanned distribution, online retailers can adopt unmanned vehicle distribution (UVD) capability sharing. We examine an online retailer’s UVD capacity sharing strategies with a logistics firm under demand surge. We develop sharing models under the unilateral and bidirectional option contracts, from which we derive the optimal ex-ante and ex-post sharing strategies and the corresponding initial, option, and total sharing quantities. We find that if the online retailer wants to secure more UVD capacity in advance, it should use the bidirectional option; otherwise, the unilateral option. Moreover, both the initial sharing and total sharing quantities under the unilateral option are greater than those under the bidirectional option, which however can increase the flexibility of the online retailer. We conduct numerical studies to ascertain the effects of the model parameters on the optimal outcomes. The numerical results show that the degree of demand fluctuation has a greater impact on the initial and total sharing quantities under the unilateral option, and has a greater impact on the option sharing quantity under the bidirectional option. Finally, comparing self-built UVD capacity and UVD capacity sharing, we generate insights to provide guidance for the operations of online retailers.}

In the last years, several sensors –mainly artificial vision systems– and sensing techniques have been proposed to address the fruit counting problem with sundry results. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) arise as the current trend in processing imagery information, due to their adaptability and efficiency in object detection. However, there is still missing an insightful analysis of the usability of such technique in fruit counting problems in groves, since the learning process is sensitive to the training input data, the sensor (affected by environmental conditions) and the architecture chosen to process the imagery set. Therefore, in this work we test two of the most common architectures: Faster R-CNN with Inception V2 and Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) with MobileNet. These detection architectures were trained and tested on three fruits: Hass avocado and lemon (both from Chile), and apples (from California - USA), under different field conditions. To address the problem of video-based fruit counting, we use multi-object tracking based on Gaussian estimation. Our system achieves fruit counting performances up to 93% (overall for all fruits) using Faster-RCNN with Inception V2, and 90% (overall for all fruits) using SSD with MobileNet. Such results can lead to further improve the decision making process in agricultural practices.}

abstract = {The debate on the sustainability of service supply chain has recently become notorious with the increased environmental and economic impacts of service materiality. Cost-effective material management in the service domain has, therefore, become a competitive priority and a means for sustainability. This essentially requires the development of quantitative models with green options for optimizing material sourcing, transportation, inventory, processing, and reverse logistics. It is, however, a challenge to assess and integrate the economic and environmental costs of material procurement and consumption within service systems. The gap is more evident in service-only supply chains such as tourism, finance, and healthcare. Thus, this paper develops a service-oriented optimization model with green options for effective material management in a service environment. The developed model is focused on managing the material procurement and processing across the supply chain of a service firm (a hotel supply chain as an example). Mathematical formulation is first provided for a deterministic single-order model and this is then extended to a multi-period comprehensive material planning model. Proposed formulations are demonstrated through a simulated supply chain of accommodation services in a hotel. The theoretical and practical implications of the results are discussed along with directions for future research. The value-added of this research is providing insight into material management across service supply chains, optimizing material assignment to offered services, and extending the impacts of green options to the whole supply chain of hotels and accommodation services.}

In response to increasing pressures applied by the conflict between supply and demand and the need for emission mitigation, the government has promoted pipeline network reform for years. However, the selection of an appropriate reform scheme is controversial, and no researcher has conducted quantitative analysis on this issue. This paper quantifies the impacts of pipeline network reform on the downstream oil supply chain of China so as to provide policy implications. An integrated evaluation framework is established by coupling a mathematical programming technique with the energy-economy-environment (3E) assessment method. Five future scenarios are designed including the baseline (BAU) and four types of reform policies: third-party access (TPA), pipeline network integration (PNI), business cooperation (BC) and third-party access combined with business cooperation (TPA-BC). The results indicate that (i) all reform schemes have significant benefits for aspects of 3E; (ii) the scenarios can be ranked by 3E performance as follows: TPA-BC > BC > PNI > TPA > BAU; and (iii) only when the pipeline networks need to reserve a high capacity margin can the advantages of PNI compared to TPA be revealed; otherwise, the gap between them is small.}

In the 3L-SDVRP splitting deliveries of customers is basically possible, i.e. a customer can be visited in two or more tours. We examine essential problem features and introduce two problem variants. In the first variant, called 3L-SDVRP with forced splitting, a delivery is only split if the demand of a customer cannot be transported by a single vehicle. In the second variant, termed 3L-SDVRP with optional splitting, splitting customer deliveries can be done any number of times. We propose a hybrid algorithm consisting of a local search algorithm for routing and a genetic algorithm and several construction heuristics for packing. Numerical experiments are conducted using three sets of instances with both industrial and academic origins. One of them was provided by an automotive logistics company in Shanghai; in this case some customers per instance have a total freight volume larger than the loading space of a vehicle. The results prove that splitting deliveries can be beneficial not only in the one-dimensional case but also when goods are modeled as three-dimensional items.}

Nowadays, with the aim to reduce the water contamination close to the refinery, the local regulations imposed to introduce solutions for the treatment of the groundwater underneath the oil treatment plants. In order to reclaim the site and to safeguard the areas close to the oil refinery, an intervention named "Pump & Treat" was adopted by an Italian company which consists in pumping up the underground water and treating it to remove any trace of polluting agent. Subsequently, a part of the treated water is discharged, by gravity, into the sea through a wastewater sewer. An Axial-Flow Pump (AFP) is studied in both pump and turbine modes for being installed in the wastewater sewer of the analysed oil refinery. After evaluating the availability of flow rate and head, the design characteristics of a proper axial turbine were identified. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations of an AFP are performed in both pump and turbine modes. The obtained results were used for scaling down the hydraulic machine and for defining a new one, properly adapted for the wastewater sewer, as energy recovery unit. The selected axial Pump-as-Turbine (PaT) allowed to achieve an economic saving of about 1706 €/year, leading to a Pay-Back Period (PBP) of about 1 year and 10 months.}

To analyze outcomes and risk factors of cardiovascular events in a metropolitan coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) database, and to perform a subgroup analysis in African American populations to determine whether outcomes and risk factors are influenced by race.
Design
Retrospective cohort analysis from March 9, 2020 to June 20, 2020.
Setting
Population-based study in Louisville, KY, USA.
Participants
Seven hundred adult inpatients hospitalized with COVID-19.
Interventions
N/A.
Measurements and Main Results
This cohort consisted of 126 patients (18%) with cardiovascular events and 574 patients without cardiovascular events. Patients with cardiovascular events had a much higher mortality rate than those without cardiovascular events (45.2% v 8.7%, p < 0.001). There was no difference between African American and white patients regarding mortality (43.9% v 46.3%, p = 1) and length of stay for survivors (11 days v 9.5 days, p = 0.301). Multiple logistics regression analysis suggested that male, race, lower SaO2/FIO2, higher serum potassium, lower serum albumin, and number of cardiovascular comorbidities were highly associated with the occurrence of cardiovascular events in COVID-19 patients. Lower serum albumin and neoplastic and/or immune-compromised diseases were highly associated with cardiovascular events for African American COVID-19 patients. SaO2/FIO2 ratio and cardiovascular comorbidity count were significantly associated with cardiovascular events in white patients.
Conclusions
Cardiovascular events were prevalent and associated with worse outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Outcomes of cardiovascular events in African American and white COVID-19 patients were similar after propensity score matching analysis. There were common and unique risk factors for cardiovascular events in African American COVID-19 patients when compared with white patients.}

The advancement in the technology ensures high volume of production. The variation in the hydrogen is due to difference in different operating parameters and feedstock characteristics. The future developments of these technologies including innovations regarding hydrogen production and storage, transport, and effective utilization reduces the dependence on fossil fuels, and green hydrogen will dominate over the traditional energy sources.

Such a project deals with the distribution of mortar to perform activities that use it. Since IPD is a strategy that encompasses several factors and agents, whose primary aim is to maximize the total quality of a product, all lifecycle of a product development aims to minimize risks of security, of use, economics, and markets. Implementing the IPD in buildings is complex, and many times during the development process, there is necessary to develop tools and artifacts to improve the process itself. The IPD diagnosed the distribution of the mortar as a critical task in the building process. Here is presented one solution adopted by the IPD design team to improve the transportation logistics of mortar, according to the product of lifecycle management (PLM) in the production of buildings. The device created following the same criteria of the global project in its development since it should meet the product IPD and meet the specific criteria of its future production. Then, by applying finite element analysis, throughout its development, it was possible to reduce the amount of welding, cut plates, and estimated time for its production. Forward, the design PLM was satisfactorily fulfilled for the device, and the global project, once it completes the design of the device, the integrated development of the production and distribution of the mortar was realized.}

abstract = {This study developed a geographical information system-based methodology to maximize the environmental and economic efficiency of large-scale energy plants using different types of biomass. As a precursor to the optimization modelling, multi-criteria spatial analyses and then transport cost optimization are applied taking into account spatial biomass availability and existing road networks, in order to identify optimal biomass energy plant sites for different combinations of biomass types. A geographical information system integrated with a capacitated maximal covering location problem model was employed to assign biomass supply points to biomass energy plants. Capacity limits of the plants and a defined maximum transportation distance were taken into consideration. The resulting information was used to examine major challenges in establishing a large-scale biomass energy plant, biomass supply logistics, environment cost and anticipated traffic congestion. A sensitivity analysis was also carried out to review the influence of plant capacity and maximum transportation distance on economic and environmental sustainability. The proposed methodology was employed utilizing agricultural and forest residues for bioelectricity generation in Queensland, Australia. It was found that 100% bagasse had the highest eco-efficiency for bioelectricity generation from multiple biomass combinations. In contrast, the combination of 70% sawmill residues and 30% forest harvest residues showed the lowest level of traffic congestion (2 trucks per hour). In addition, the impact of traffic congestion of bulky sugarcane residues can be reduced by adding forest residues to the biomass supply. The advantages of the resulting solution are further enhanced when social impacts such as energy security, new income opportunities and job creation are taken into account in addition to the sustainability aspects.}

In Brazil, charcoal production can be a complementary climate change mitigation alternative to recycling. This study has assessed CO2 abatement potentials and costs in a low-carbon (LC) scenario for the Brazilian steel industry based on two circular bioeconomy-based options. For this purpose, Brazilian steel production was forecasted up to 2050 through an econometric model. The technical amount of scrap and the economic feasibility of charcoal have been estimated to determine the penetration of LC strategies. In addition, an uncertainty analysis was conducted using the Monte Carlo method. For the median value in the simulation, we found that crude steel production will emit 64 MtCO2 in 2050. A recycling share of 36% of the total steel production could reduce these emissions by 20%, and 86% of the remaining blast furnace production could be based on charcoal, improving the total abatement by 65%. The weighted average cost of the LC scenario is -$1/tCO2 for the median value in the simulation, but positive values have been found in 45% of the simulations. Charcoal presents higher abatement costs but less uncertainty than recycling. Such strategies can significantly reduce Brazilian steelmaking emissions, postponing other emerging or more expensive alternatives. Nevertheless, economic policies are needed due to additional costs of charcoal, in conjunction with law enforcement to ensure sustainable charcoal production, and regulations are needed to improve logistics and scrap market disparities.}

A hybrid heuristic algorithm combined with modified Clark-Wright saving algorithm and tabu search (MCWSA-TS) is proposed to solve the problem. By comparing the solutions of CPLEX and MCWSA-TS, this study demonstrates that MCWSA-TS searches the solution space and produces good solutions efficiently and effectively. We implemented sensitivity analysis on the service strategy, pick-up radius, and vehicle types. The results show that cooperation between self-pickup and door-to-door delivery services can help decrease the overall operational costs.}

To determine how well decision tree models can predict tailor-assigned uniform sizes using anthropometry data from the New Zealand Defence Force Anthropometry Survey (NZDFAS). This information may inform automatic sizing systems for military personnel.
Methods
Anthropometric data from two separate samples of the New Zealand Defence Force military were used. Data on Army personnel from the NZDFAS (n = 583) were used to develop a series of shirt- and trouser-size prediction models based on decision trees. Different combinations of physical, automatic, and post-processed measurements (the latter two derived from a 3D body scan) were trialled, and the models with the highest cross-validation accuracy were retained. The accuracy of these models were then tested on an independent sample of Army recruits (n = 154).
Results
The automated measurement method (measurements derived automatically by the body scanner software) were the best predictors of shirt size (58.1% accuracy) and trouser size (61.7%), with body weight and waist girth being the strongest predictors. Clothing sizes that were incorrectly predicted by the model where generally one size above or below the tailor-predicted size.
Conclusions
Anthropometry measurements, when used with decision tree models, show promise for classifying clothing size. Methodological changes such as fitting gender-specific models, using additional anthropometry variables, and testing other data mining techniques are avenues for future work. More research is required before fully automated body scanning is a viable option for obtaining fast and accurate clothing sizes for military clothing and logistics departments.}

Greening the supply chain is seen as adding a competitive edge to a company's supply chain. Food companies and food supply chains face even more significant challenges as they are highly affected by climatic change, food regulations, and resource limitations. Food companies need to incorporate environmental thinking into their core strategies and extend it across the whole supply chain. The aim of this chapter is to provide an overview of how a green food supply chain can be achieved. Different elements of the green food supply chain are discussed which are as follows: green food product, green farming, green food product design, green food sourcing and procurement, green warehousing, green food logistics, and green food supply chains.}

abstract = {Problems to solve nowadays have never been so complex and are continuously increasing in complexity. In this context Systems of Systems (SoS) may be a solution but the study of such systems is far from over. An SoS is a complex system characterized by the particular nature of its components: the latter, which are systems, tend to be managerially and operationally independent as well as geographically distributed. This specific characterization led to re-think research fields of classic systems engineering, such as definition, taxonomy, modeling, architecting, etc. SoS architecting focuses on the way independent components of an SoS can be dynamically structured and can autonomously and efficiently modify their interactions in order to fulfill the goal of the SoS and to cope with the high dynamics of the environment. This paper contributes to the multi-agent and SoS research fields by proposing a new generic SoS model called SApHESIA which considers the SoS main characteristics found in the literature and extends the notion of environment and interactions between component systems. It also proposes a new SoS architecting procedure based on the Adaptive Multi-Agent System (AMAS) approach that advocates full cooperation between all the components of the SoS through the concept of criticality. This criticality is a measure, local to each component, expressing its difficulties to reach its local goals. In this procedure, the SoS architecture evolves to self-adapt to the dynamics of the environment in which it is plunged, while considering the respective local goals of its components. An instantiation of SApHESIA to two distinct cases studies from different domains (logistics and exploratory missions) is done to obtain two SoSs. These two SoS are then coupled to form a new SoS at an upper level. Evaluations of these SoSs show that their cooperation make each of them more efficient.}

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been suggested to play important roles in major depressive disorder (MDD) and antidepressant treatment. The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the association of DNA methylation changes in the BDNF gene with MDD and antidepressant treatment.
Methods
A total of 291 MDD patients and 100 healthy controls were included and followed up for 6 weeks. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-17 (HDRS-17) was used to measure treatment improvement. The life events scales (LES) and childhood trauma questionnaire (CTQ) were used to rate recent and early life stress. DNA methylation levels of CpG sites in the BDNF gene were measured.
Results
Two CpG sites in BDNF exon VI (BDNF133 and BDNF134) were demonstrated to have significantly higher methylation in MDD patients than in controls (both FDR-adjusted P = 0.001). A logistics regression model indicated that the interaction between the hypermethylation of BDNF133 and negative subscore of LES was associated to MDD (OR=0.0075, P<0.001). Methylation of BDNF140 at baseline was significantly elevated in remitters (FDR-adjusted P = 0.046) at week 6. In subgroup analyses, these findings could be replicated in females, but not in males.
Limitations
The methylation status of BDNF after 6 weeks of antidepressant treatment was not measured and the DNA methylation were detected in peripheral blood cells.
Conclusions
These findings highlight gender-specific alteration of methylation at several CpG sites in BDNF exon VI as a promising candidate indicator of MDD and antidepressant-induced remission.}

As a result, port research has a consensus that the global logistics systems have been restructured with ports at the center and, hence, the role of the port is becoming more important in the regional economy. However, port studies about economic impacts are mainly focused on estimating the whole effects by applying cross-sectional methodologies at a specific time period. In this context, this study implements an empirical analysis by applying shift-share analysis and correlation analysis. At the level of a sector in a regional economy, the gross value added (GVA) per transportation worker is examined from 1990 to 2015. As a result, this study suggests the significant implication that the intensification of functional integration and port regionalization is likely to enlarge the disparity between port cities in light of the impacts of the ports on its regional economies. This implication can be supported by the result that four port regions in South Korea have greater levels of gross value added per worker in transportation and higher proportions of transportation in the regional economy compared to regions without large ports.}

Accordingly, this paper deals with the definition of types of inland IT combining different structural elements and the selection of efficient terminal types (TT). For solving this problem, a novel approach for defining the types of inland IT and a hybrid model for evaluating their efficiency are developed in this paper. The model combines the fuzzy EDAS (Evaluation Based on Distance from Average Solution) method of multi-criteria decision-making, used for defining the input weight limits based on the requirements of the stakeholders, and the AR DEA (Assurance Region Data Envelopment Analysis) non-parametric method, used for evaluating the efficiency of the types of inland IT. The applicability of the proposed model is demonstrated by solving the problem of selecting the efficient TTs in the group of “small” inland ITs, based on the analysis of real ITs in Europe. For the most efficient TT, the “small” inland road-rail hub terminal, mainly performing basic, supplementary and accompanying functions, is selected. The selected TT represent the benchmark for the other ITs that have the potential to develop into them and become the important elements in the development of the transport networks, regionalization of the ports and geographic expansion of their hinterlands, which are the key initiators of the regions' macro-economic development.}

Additionally, existing studies have not yet addressed sufficiently the enablers of blockchain adoption and the interplay with supply chain performance. In order to reduce this gap, this study aims to examine the potential influence of blockchain on supply chain performance. We draw on the literature on technology adoption and supply chain performance, as well as on the emerging blockchain literature, to develop and test a model in two countries, namely India and the US. Accordingly, we administered a survey in order to review the opinions and views of supply chain practitioners. The results support the model and indicate that blockchain applications can improve supply chain performance. In particular, our findings suggest that knowledge sharing and trading partner pressure play an important role in blockchain adoption, and that supply chain performance is significantly influenced by supply chain transparency and blockchain transparency. Another finding was the inexistence of evidence for a moderation effect of the industry variable on the outcomes. The research conclusions have substantial managerial and theoretical implications. Our model contributes mainly to the theoretical advancement of SCM-blockchain, thus allowing scholars to adapt our validated model.}

Designing an efficient and reliable medical waste reverse supply chain (MWRSC) is extremely beneficial to society. Most studies on this issue have only considered the generated waste and have not reported the uncertainty in the amount of medical waste generation and other MWRSC parameters. Sustainability criteria and environmental issues in choosing treatment technology are rarely considered as well. In this research, a linear programming model under uncertainty is developed to design an MWRSC. The proposed model is multi-item and multi-period with three objective functions. The first objective function minimizes total costs, the second objective function is relevant to the best treatment technology selection and the third objective function minimizes the total medical waste stored. A robust possibilistic programming approach is utilized to handle imprecise parameters in the model and a fuzzy goal programming method is employed to build up a multi-objective model. A real case study is conducted to illustrate the potential of the proposed model which involves different attributes and problems, such as the location and capacity of facilities, and the type of treatment technology. Furthermore, the transferring amount of medical waste among different nodes is calculated.}

The 76-bottleneck variables abstracted from the literature were used to craft a structured questionnaire that were administered to respondents in the manufacturing industry whose size was determined at a 95% confidence level and 5% error margin respectively. The 95% confidence level is chosen to ensure adequate representation of the population and to validate the data for the study. The respondents' scores were collated into (m x n) data matrix which served as input variable into the factor analysis model. StatistiXL software was then employed to evaluate the data matrix. The trivial variables were discarded and 19 factors with eigenvalues (λ ˃ 1) were extracted and creatively labelled for interpretation. The result established that the “Process capability index” is the principal bottleneck factor that loaded 25% of the variables studied. The principal variables in the cluster include Equipment failure = -0.832, Operations = -0.780, Material unavailability = -0.811, and Market demand = -0.739 among others. Similarly, Manufacturing process restraint, Resources, Weather, Communication, Logistics, and Line dedication are other key factors by the magnitude of their respective variables’ factor loadings such as Random event = 0.812, Raw materials flow = -0.834, Process technology = 0.878, and Random environmental factors among other variables. Although bottleneck problems vary from one manufacturing system to another, the problems identified and the solutions presented in this study are generic and the improvement effort should focus on addressing the principal variables while not neglecting the middling and weakling variables.}

Providing efficient distribution systems for services on the last mile has become a challenging issue for logistics companies, where a trade-off between the classical approaches, attended home delivery (AHD) and usage of shared delivery locations (SDLs) has been identified. AHD provides a higher quality of service but implies very high costs for the company, while usage of SDL requires customers to perform the very last mile by themselves. For companies, this bears the risk of a decrease in the perceived service quality. However, due to consolidation effects, transportation costs can be considerably mitigated. We propose a mixed delivery approach, which combines AHD and SDL usage in an innovative way. Customers can either be served at home during their preferred time window, or they can be asked to pick up their parcel at one of the SDLs. For each customer served using an SDL, the company pays a compensation price in order to reduce the perceived decrease in service quality. The newly introduced decision problem is formulated mathematically. We propose two matheuristics to efficiently solve large instances. In an extensive numerical study, we show that the new approach clearly outperforms standard ones. We observe an increase in solution quality of up to 40%, while customers’ perceived quality of service is not affected. Additionally, the results reveal that the obtained improvements are robust for different customer-specific time-window preferences, accepted travel times needed to reach an SDL, and different compensation schemes.}

abstract = {Introduction
With the increasing demand for medical imaging, non-attendance inhibits private and public radiology practices in Singapore from providing timely care and achieving maximal efficiency. Missed radiological appointments adversely affect clinical and economic outcomes and strain the finite healthcare resources. We examined the prevalence and predictors of patient non-attendance for radiological services at a regional public hospital in Singapore and compared them against other medical imaging centres globally.
Methods
Outpatient records of patients who were scheduled for specialised medical imaging obtained from Radiological Information System (RIS) were retrospectively reviewed. Analysed variables include patient demographics, radiology modalities, visit statuses and appointment lead times where Pearson's chi-square test and Fisher's exact test were used for categorical variables, and independent sample t-test was used for continuous variables. The association between each patient characteristic and non-attendance status was assessed using Binary Logistics Regression. Variables that showed statistical significance in univariate analysis were included in the multivariate logistic regression model to identify the independent risk factors associated with non-attendance.
Results
Among the 59,748 outpatient appointments with medical imaging requests, 15.5% did not turn up for their appointments. Logistic regression indicated that patient's age, ethnicity, subsidy status, house ownership, living vicinity to regional hospital cluster, appointment wait times, appointment hours and appointment months were significant factors associated with the failure to attend scheduled radiological examinations.
Conclusion
Even though predictors of non-attendance remained consistent across medical imaging centres worldwide, Singapore reported a higher prevalence of missed appointments calling for future exploratory studies to understand the population's health-seeking behaviours and ordering patterns of clinicians.
Implications for practice
Comparison and identification of these predictors will assist in the design of targeted interventions that may improve patient's adherence and utilisation of imaging services.}

abstract = {Port development is an important driver for global economic growth, and also a main energy user and polluter in the world. Amid the global energy crisis and environmental degradation, the international port community has proposed the concept of green port. Zhuhai Port, an important shipping and logistics platform in southern China, is confronted with key questions of how to effectively conduct environmental pollution control and green development performance evaluation, while its size and business performance continue the rapid growth. To address this problem, this study first suggested a green port indicator system tailored-made for Zhuhai Port, and then uses the fuzzy importance-performance analysis (FIPA) method to determine the performance of Zhuhai Port in green port indicators before putting forward a governance strategy. The study shows that Zhuhai Port should focus on monitoring of energy consumption and pollutant emissions, innovation of scientific research technologies and development of green port schemes to deepen the concept of green development and improve the energy conservation and environmental protection capacity of the port. The research results can serve as a theoretical basis for formulation of Zhuhai’s green port policies and the establishment of an effective methodology system.}

abstract = {The recent evolution of information technology in logistics has facilitated the digital freight brokerage, which allows shippers and trucks to match needs and services in a short-term period. In the context of freight brokerages, this paper considers a dynamic fleet assignment problem related to matching demand and supply. We particularly integrate practical operational characteristics, such as territory-based assignment and transferring, which have not been considered in the dynamic fleet assignment problem. We first formulate the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to represent uncertain and sequential decision-making procedures. Furthermore, to overcome the dimensionality and ambiguity of the MDP model, we proposed a reinforcement learning(RL) approach with function approximation for solving the MDP model. Finally, numerical experiments are carried out to illustrate the superiority of the RL method and analyze the effects of operational characteristics. A numerical analysis shows that the proposed RL-based method provides more rewards than other policies, such as myopic policy and first-come-first-served (FCFS) policy, for all test scenarios. The RL-based method is even better for a situation in which the delivery territories are highly overlapped and customer demand exceeds to supply capacity, which requires precise capacity control. In addition, we observe that significant achievement can be attained by allowing trucks to deliver with transfer.}

Here, changes in levels of quality attributes, cell wall constituents, activities and expression of cell wall modifying enzymes, were evaluated in strawberry fruit treated with 1.5% (w/v) chitosan coating and stored at 4 °C for 12 days. Chitosan coating had a significant inhibitory effect on fruit softening during cold storage, rather than other quality attributes. Chitosan coating treated fruit showed the reduction in the content of water-soluble pectin coincident with significant inhibition in activities of polygalacturonase (PG) and pectin methylesterase (PME), and expression of FaPG1and FaPME1, relative to the controls. Activities of these two enzymes and expression of FaPG1 were significantly correlated with the contents of water-soluble pectin. Besides, the decreased link between cellulose and hemicellulose was indicated by the reduced transcript levels of FaXTH1 and FaEXP2, with significantly positive correlation. In conclusion, the effect of chitosan coating on strawberry fruit mainly involves the softening inhibition by metabolic enzymes of pectin, especially PG and PME. The results will provide insights into developing measures to control strawberry fruit softening during cold storage and cold chain logistics.}

abstract = {Reasoned fertilization, which is a major concern for sustainable and efficient agriculture, consists of applying customized fertilizers which requires a very large increase in the number of fertilizer formulae, involving increasing costs due to the multiplication of production batch, of storage areas and of transportation constraints. An alternative solution is given by adopting a Reverse Blending approach, which is a new Blending Problem where inputs are non-pre-existing composite materials that need to be defined in both number and composition, simultaneously with the quantities to be used in the blending process, such as to meet the specifications of a wide variety of outputs, while keeping their number as small as possible. This would replace the production of a large variety of small batches of fertilizers by few large batches of new composite materials whose blending may be performed close to end-users (delayed differentiation), delivering substantial production and logistics cost savings, well in excess of remote blending costs. Reverse Blending presents some analogies with the Pooling Problem which is a two-stage Blending Problem where primary inputs are existing raw materials. An adapted version of this problem may be used to facilitate the design of new composite materials used by Reverse Blending. This paper presents the Reverse Blending approach, whose modelling is based on a quadratic programming formulation, and a large case study to demonstrate its feasibility. Reverse Blending, therefore, may be a disruptive approach to successfully reengineer not only the fertilizer supply chain but any other industry operating in blending contexts to meet a great diversity.}

Autologous cell therapy (AuCT) is an emerging therapeutic treatment that is undergoing transformation from laboratory- to industry-scale manufacturing with recent regulatory approvals. Various challenges facing the complex AuCT manufacturing and supply chain process hinder the scale out and broader application of this highly potent treatment.
Methods
We present a multiscale logistics simulation framework, AuCT-Sim, that integrates novel supply chain system modeling algorithms, methods, and tools. AuCT-Sim includes a single facility model and a system-wide network model. Unique challenges of the AuCT industry are analyzed and addressed in AuCT-Sim. Decision-supporting tools can be developed based on this framework to explore “what-if” manufacturing and supply chain scenarios of importance to various cell therapy stakeholder groups.
Results
Two case studies demonstrate the decision-supporting capability of AuCT-Sim where one investigates the optimal reagent base stocking level, and the other one simulates a reagent supply disruption event. These case studies serve as guidelines for designing computational experiments with AuCT-Sim to solve specific problems in AuCT manufacturing and supply chain.
Discussion
This simulation framework will be useful in understanding the impact of possible manufacturing and supply chain strategies, policies, regulations, and standards informing strategies to increase patient access to AuCT.}

Consequently, each vehicle should visit not only customer nodes but also (possibly) some charging stations before the battery got depleted. The importance of this problem stems from the fact that logistics companies are increasingly relying on electric vehicles in urban distribution. We propose three exact approaches. The first one requires solving a compact polynomial-sized formulation. The second approach is a branch-and-cut algorithm. An original feature of this algorithm is that it embeds the first exact separation of the well-known rounded capacity constraints. Finally, the third approach is a hybrid algorithm that requires solving an augmented variant of the compact formulation. We report the results of a computational study that was carried out on a set of 125 instances, providing evidence that the polynomial-sized formulation can consistently solve instances having up to 30 customer nodes and 21 charging stations, and that the hybrid algorithm solves some instances having up to 100 customer nodes and 21 charging stations while requiring moderate CPU times. Furthermore, the proposed approach was shown to exhibit limitations in solving some large-scale tightly-constrained instances.}

Our study aimed to find predictor(s) for predicting the sperm retrieval rate (SRR) in NOAs and guide clinicians in choosing different surgical approaches, TESA or MD-TESE for NOAs. 294 NOAs who had undergone TESA or MD-TESE were divided into TESA group and MD-TESE group. Depending on sperm retrieval, each group was divided into two subgroups: successful subgroups and failure subgroups. They respectively were 24 cases and 131 cases, 53 cases and 86 cases. Clinical data, including body mass index (BMI), testicular volume, and serum hormone levels, were analyzed in a retrospective manner. The results showed that follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels and SRR were lower in TESA group as compared to these in MD-TESE group, while testicular volume was higher (P < 0.05). The surgical approach of sperm retrieval significantly affected the SRR (P < 0.05). In TESA subgroups, testicular volume, FSH and LH differed significantly (P < 0.05). In MD-TESE subgroups, the level of FSH and LH differed significantly between both groups (P < 0.05). Using logistics regression, we found a negative correlation (β=-0.083) between FSH and the SRR in TESA group but a positive correlation (β = 0.064) in MD-TESE group (P < 0.05). In conclusion, serum FSH level can predict the SRR of NOAs and guide the clinicians while selecting the suitable surgery approach for NOAs.}

A general framework, including the mathematical model and solution approach, is proposed to optimize the fuel consumption for the non-working distance and is implemented by vehicles in intra- and inter-fields. A mixed integer model is formulated and combined with a search algorithm to find an optimal solution. Subsequently, a case study related to wheat harvesting is presented to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the search. Compared with the operational schedule, fuel consumed by harvesters in non-working activities is reduced significantly by 19.5%. Furthermore, total fuel consumed by harvesters is reduced by 16.3%. This paper provides a general framework for reducing the fuel consumption of agricultural vehicles and makes these agricultural vehicles more environmentally friendly.}

abstract = {In recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the importance of sewers as preferential pathways for vapor intrusion. This pathway involves volatile organic compound (VOC)-impacted vapor migration through the interior of pipes or conduits towards the potential receptor. A number of research initiatives have been undertaken to improve the understanding of this pathway which, in turn, supports development of sampling methods to evaluate whether it is a concern at a given site. One aspect of the conceptual model that is important to understanding the potential risk of sewer vapor intrusion is the degree to which VOC concentrations vary over time. This paper presents results of field sampling conducted in Texas, Utah, and California to explore temporal variability of chlorinated VOC concentrations in sewer vapor over different timescales. These results, along with results from other studies, suggest that wide ranges of VOC concentrations can occur at given sampling locations. However, long-term temporal variability (months to years) is much higher than short-term variability (days). The timescale over which the variations occur has implications on sampling methods and frequency. The results suggest that multiple grab samples collected over a longer time period, such as on a quarterly basis, are more appropriate for characterizing the long-term average sewer vapor concentrations than single time-integrated samples collected over a period of hours to days. Because time-integrated samples can often be logistically more difficult to collect, an understanding of the timescale of variability may help practitioners balance field logistics considerations with data adequacy when characterizing VOC concentrations in sewers.}

abstract = {South Africa is the second-largest exporter of fresh citrus fruit, which is shipped to various distant markets for extended durations. Rising production quantities and increasingly more stringent phytosanitary requirements have placed considerable pressure on the logistics chain and the availability of precooling facilities. One solution to this challenge has been the application of ambient loading when using high-cube refrigerated containers, whereby fruit are cooled in-transit during shipping, instead of on-site by precooling. This study explored the effect of two package designs and the benefits of first partially precooling fruit prior to loading in shipping containers. Performance parameters was evaluated based on cooling rate and cooling uniformity of fruit within the spatial domain of the container. Containers loaded with Supervent and Opentop cartons had a mean cooling period (from initial to 4 °C) of 2.0 and 1.6 days, respectively. However, the study identified a high variability in cooling rate between and within individual containers. This was attributed to the presence of unpredictable gaps around the pallet stacks, which are formed during loading. These unique ensembles of gaps substantially influenced how cooling airflow was delivered throughout the container. The results thus showed package design is not a primary influencer of cooling performance. Partially precooling fruit to 10 °C, before loading, reduced susceptibility to chilling injury and decreased the presence of hot spots throughout the containers, so reducing the cooling variability within the shipment. This work highlighted the complex thermodynamic processes within fully loaded refrigerated containers, which should be characterised in future research.}

This idea of smart cities is slowly but surely coming into reality as many countries around the globe are adopting this idea and coming up with their own model of smart cities. At the core of smart city lies the sensors and actuators embedded in the smart devices that sense the environment for facilitating effective decision making. The microcontrollers available in these devices are programmed to take decisions automatically based on the information received from the sensors.

Thus, this study presents the life cycle assessment (LCA) of using OSPW for cement-based building materials manufacturing, aiming to assess OSPW influence on environmental impact indicators (global warming potential, embodied energy and total impact). Altogether, 127 mixtures are analyzed, such as mortars, concretes, masonry and paving blocks. The impacts of OSPW drying and logistics are presented, as well as the impacts of the process (burning) to produce the heat-treated waste (HTOSPW). The results indicate that OSPW is a good alternative to reduce environmental impacts in the analyzed scenario (Espírito Santo (ES) state – Brazil), as a replacement for limestone filler, sand or stone dust. OSPW could be used as a cement partial replacement and presented satisfactory environmental results at high replacement levels (over 50%) in the production of self-compacting concrete, rendering and masonry mortars. The results also show that the artificial drying alternatives greatly increase the OSPW impact. Regarding the production of the mixtures, cement replacement was the approach most commonly used, causing a reduction in environmental impact indicators of 7.7 to 9.0% for each 10% of OSPW use.}

abstract = {The establishment of freight transport facilities and logistics operations in urban areas tends to create substantial public health and land use burdens, due to the high concentration of people and the limited availability of land. This paper proposes a tri-objective supply chain network design model, to address the economic, public health, and land use impacts, associated with an urban freight transport network. The capability of the proposed model and methodologies are illustrated using a case study of the freight transport network in Can Tho city, which involves the selection of raw material sourcing and product distribution locations across rural and urban areas. The metric of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) is used to represent the overall public health impact of the transport emissions exposure in people living within 5000 m of the transportation routes. Geographical information system (GIS) tools are used to explore the population density distribution across transport network areas and to estimate the number of exposed people. The land use impact due to the presence of warehouses and plants is taken into account, using the life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) method. The obtained design solutions under single- and multi-objective optimization are presented. The trade-offs among the contradictory objectives are also analyzed to obtain various alternative solutions, allowing geographers to understand how to design environmentally benign, urban freight transport networks, based on sustainable development preferences.}

abstract = {Closed-loop supply chain network design (CLSCND) has been increasingly spotlighted over the latest decade. The focus has been given to maximize the economic performance, resource utilization and sustainability through incorporating a holistic decision-making on both forward and reverse logistics. In this paper, a new fuzzy-stochastic multi-objective mathematical model is formulated for sustainable CLSCND. The model aims at balancing the trade-off between cost effectiveness and environmental performance under different types of uncertainty. The environmental performance of CLSCND is measured by carbon emission. Moreover, the network flexibility is modeled and incorporated in the decision-making so that customer demands can be fulfilled by different means. In order to solve the complex optimization problem, the model is first defuzzilized and converted into an equivalent crisp form. Then, a sample average approximation based weighting method (SAAWM) is developed to obtain a set of Pareto optimal solutions between cost and carbon emission under different uncertain environments. The model is validated through a set of numerical experiments. The computational results show, through the incorporation with network flexibility, the proposed mathematical model and solution approach can effectively generate consistent objective values and solutions over different scenario trees and obtain robust strategic decisions on facility locations. Meanwhile, the flexibility and rationality of the decision-making on transportation management, demand allocation and facility operations can be improved as well.}

This fact creates the need for the design of logistic-train-fleet-oriented, distributed and scalability-robust control policies ensuring deadlock-free operations. This paper presents a solution to a milk-run vehicle routing and scheduling problem subject to fuzzy pick-up and delivery transportation time constraints. Since this type of problem can be treated as a fuzzy constraint satisfaction problem, an elegant solution can be determined using both computer simulation and analytical ordered-fuzzy-number-driven calculations. In contrast to standard fuzzy numbers, the support of a fuzzy number obtained by algebraic operations performed on the ordered fuzzy numbers domain does not expand. The possibility of carrying out algebraic operations is limited to selected domains of the computability of these supports. The proposed sufficient conditions implying the calculability of arithmetic operations guarantee interpretability of the results obtained. Consequently, they confirm the competitiveness of the analytical approach in relation to time-consuming computer-simulation-based calculations of logistic train fleet schedules. Finally, it is demonstrated on the basis of the results obtained in the study that the proposed approach constitutes an effective solution to the problem discussed. In this context, the proposed paper is a continuation of the authors’ recent research presented at the International Conference on Computational Science 2020.}

This tendency reflects significant changes in the typologies of ceramic products, which in turn result in a modified batch design and different raw materials. Such an evolution implies an increasing stress on the supply chain, which role is strategic in terms of resource efficiency and competitiveness of the ceramic industry. Despite the importance of a secure and affordable supply, a global knowledge of raw materials flows over the last years is still lacking. In this paper, the supply chain was examined by quantifying the apparent consumption of raw materials and current trends, and detecting possible criticalities. While the supply chain in Italy kept stable, the raw material flows in the Spanish industry changed noticeably due to the increase in white-firing bodies production, that implies a growing dependence on imports. Beyond the specific features of each country, the resulting supply patterns are turning similar over time, with an increasing competition for the same sources. Efforts to strengthen the supply chain reside on the diversification of raw materials sources, which entails the use of secondary raw materials, the search for new deposits and purification processes, and improvement of logistics. The choice of raw materials (and consequently the supply chain) is driven in a complex way by various factors, which are identified and discussed for the different product typologies..}

The distinguishing feature of MCVRPTW is that products must be transported in independent vehicle compartments because they cannot be mixed together due to differences in their characteristics. Based on the mathematical formulation established for the optimization problem, we propose and compare two solution approaches, with one being the hybrid particle swarm optimization (HPSO) with simulated annealing, and the other being the conventional particle swarm optimization (PSO). Based on Solomon's vehicle routing problem with time windows (Solomon, 1987), experimental instances with 25 customers, 50 customers and 100 customers are developed to investigate the performance of the proposed solution approaches. The results indicate that both approaches are reasonably efficient for the MCVRPTW. Moreover, the HPSO algorithm has overall better performance, particularly in delivering the best solution, for all cases, and the HPSO algorithm becomes more efficient than the PSO algorithm as the problem size increases. On the other hand, the PSO algorithm shows a slight edge in terms of the worst solution and standard deviation.}

Many displaced persons live in camps and other temporary settlements long after the displacement event occurs. However, there is little evidence on environmental health conditions in the transitional phase—defined by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees as six months to two years after displacement. To address this gap in research, we conducted a systematic scoping review of environmental health conditions, exposures, and outcomes in transitional displacement settings, as well as reported obstacles and recommendations for improvement. Eighty-eight publications met the inclusion criteria. Water supply was the most frequently discussed environmental health topic. Overcrowding was the most common risk factor reported, Vibrio cholerae was the most common pathogen reported, and diarrhea was the most commonly reported health outcome. Obstacles and recommendations were categorized as institutional, political or implementation-based. Identified knowledge gaps included minimal information on setting logistics and on topics such as menstrual hygiene, oral hygiene and fomite contamination. In order to improve environmental health conditions in transitional displacement settings, all levels of government and non-governmental organizations should increase collaboration to improve resource provision. This study is the first to report on environmental health conditions in this important time of transition between the emergency and protracted stages of displacement.}

A novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2) emerged in late 2019, causing an outbreak of pneumonia [coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)] globally. Although the use of ready-made reaction mixes can enable more rapid PCR-based diagnosis of COVID-19, the need to transport and store these mixes at low temperatures presents challenges to already overburdened logistics networks.
Methods
Here, we present an optimized freeze-drying procedure that allows SARS-CoV-2 PCR mixes to be transported and stored at ambient temperatures, without loss of activity. Additive-supplemented PCR mixes were freeze-dried. The residual moisture of the freeze-dried PCR mixes was measured by Karl-Fischer titration.
Results
We found that the freeze-dried PCR mixes with ~1.2% residual moisture are optimal for storage, transport, and reconstitution. The sensitivity, specificity, and repeatability of the freeze-dried reagents were similar to those of freshly prepared, wet reagents. The freeze-dried mixes retained activity at room temperature (18 ~ 25 °C) for 28 days, and for 14 and 10 days when stored at 37 °C and 56 °C, respectively.
Conclusion
The uptake of this approach will ease logistical challenges faced by transport networks and make more cold storage space available at diagnosis and hospital laboratories.}

The electric vehicle routing problem with time window (EVRPTW) is an extension of the traditional vehicle routing problem with time window (VRPTW), where new features of electric vehicles are considered, such as limited battery capacities, lack of infrastructures, and long charging time. In this study, new technical formulations were presented for vehicle route selection and charging station visit, which reduces the formulation complexity without using duplicated dummy nodes or arcs. Besides, a new linearization method was developed that employs a set of secant lines to surrogate the concave nonlinear charging function with linear constraints. This method defines the charging time as a continuous variable and uses fewer variables than existing formulation in literature. A mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model was developed for the EVRPTW and computational experiments on Solomon's VRPTW instances were conducted to verify the proposed model. The experimental results were compared with those obtained by traditional routing models, which showed that the proposed model can result in better EVs logistics schedules with higher charging time utilizations.}

To take into account the carbon footprint on crude oil from its international distribution segment, we utilize a micro-level dataset of more than 28,000 individual shipment samples to estimate each journey’s carbon emissions. The unique detailed dataset enables us to aggregate carbon emissions at the country level for importers and exporters, by trade lane, and by vessel size categories. Our methodology provides a framework for crude oil consumers to dynamically account for the carbon footprint of the commodity which is transported via different trade routes and by different vessels (size and age). So far, this dynamic emissions accounting has been largely neglected by oil consumers who typically apply one single emission factor regardless its supply chain. Our results highlight the importance for importers to consider the origin and point-of-use of crude oil in order to have a comprehensive view of its carbon footprint. The quantitative analysis in this study can feed into well-to-tank fuel emissions factors for oil and oil products in order to adopt dynamic emissions factors in companies' carbon accounting. Finally, our research is important for the design of new environmental policies for the corporate Environmental Social Governance (ESG) reporting to include downstream logistics in the overall emission accounting of oil companies.}

Focusing on leading producers of palm oil worldwide, we have analyzed a total of 93 sea routes from Malaysia and Indonesia to main export markets in the US, Europe, and Asia. The analysis distinguishes three freight categories: light, medium-weight, and heavy for different sizes of capacity and types of container ships based on the twenty-foot equivalent unit (TEU). The findings highlight the dependency of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions level on other factors such as technology, size, and mass flow used for container ships. The results also show a strong relationship between GHG emitted and the type of container ship in a systemic view. A ship with higher TEU contributes to the higher transported amount and lower GHG emissions in the long term. To conclude, the results would increase port industry stakeholders’ understanding of developing energy policies and managerial strategies for low cost and low carbon fuels technologies.}

This tool builds upon a GIS infrastructure and manipulates heterogeneous traceability records gathered along the processes of the food supply chain to calculate a dashboard of multidisciplinary indicators related to three pillars of food systems: safety, cost, and environmental sustainability. A real-world distribution process regarding three batches of fresh fruits handled and shipped by a logistic provider located in North Italy is used as a testbed. The tool estimates the time fence where products experienced unsafe conservation temperatures (i.e. 8% of distribution time) together with the impact on the product's shelf life decay and the carbon emissions from transportation. Therefore, this tool contributes to shedding light on the impacts that occur throughout food distribution and aids decision-making by logistic managers and quality managers, as well as improving consumers' awareness products' shelf life and footprint.}

abstract = {An insecure energy supply has promoted the search of alternative energies. Anaerobic digestion can produce methane from energy crops. Opuntia ficus-indica or cactus pear can produce high amounts of dry matter (DM), 10 Mg ha−1 y−1 with an average rainfall of 400 mm y−1. It is a crop with a high efficiency in the use of water (4.6 mg DM g−1 H2O) and can grow on land not currently used for the production of other crops. This review found that Opuntia productivity strongly depends on agronomic management (50 Mg ha−1 y−1). The increase in DM is reflected in an increase in the theoretical yield of biogas and methane. Opuntia cladodes have a high potential for producing methane (327 m3 CH4 Mg−1 VS) because their carbohydrates have a low fiber content and are easily degraded. To optimize the production and quality of the biogas produced from Opuntia, its cladodes would have to be mixed with other raw materials (e.g. manure, plant residues, microalgae) and C/N ratio (16–30) for microorganisms in the digestate; the pH would also have to be modified to a neutral-alkaline range (the cladodes have a pH between 3.5 and 5.5) for the same reason. The resulting digestate could be applied to the soil as a biofertilizer, improving its properties as well as crop productivity. This is important, above all, in soils in semi-arid zones. Finally, there are several challenges to validate Opuntia as an energy crop, especially from a holistic viewpoint that considers economic, social and environmental aspects.}

abstract = {Installation and maintenance strategies regarding offshore wind farm operations involve extensive logistics. The main focus is the right temporal and spatial placement of personnel and equipment, while taking into account forecasted meteorological and ocean conditions. For these operations to be successful, weather windows characterized by certain permissive wave conditions are of enormous importance, whereas unforeseen events result in high cost and risk of safety. Numerical modelling of waves, water levels and current related variables has been used extensively to forecast ocean conditions. To account for the inherited model uncertainty, several error modelling techniques can be implemented for the numerical model forecasts to be corrected. In this study, various Bayesian Network (BN) models are incorporated, in order to enhance the accuracy of the significant wave height predictions and to be compared with other techniques, in conditions resembling the real-time nature of the application. The implemented BN models differ in terms of training and structure and provide overall the most satisfying performance. Supplementary, it is shown that the BN models illustrate significant advantages as both quantitative and conceptual tools, since they produce estimates for the underlying uncertainty of the phenomena, while providing information about the incorporated variables’ dependence relationships through their structure.}

abstract = {Background
We performed this analysis to identify the rates, predictors, and associated outcomes of unexpected neurosurgical evacuation in a multicenter randomized clinical trial, Antihypertensive Treatment of Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage (ATACH) 2.
Methods
The ATACH 2 trial determined the efficacy of antihypertensive treatment in patients with spontaneous supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhages (ICHs) with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of ≥5 and intraparenchymal hematoma volume of <60 cm3 on initial computed tomographic scan. We determined the proportion of ICH patients requiring unanticipated surgical evacuation and identified baseline factors associated with evacuation.
Results
Among the 992 subjects analyzed, 44 (4.4%) subjects required unanticipated surgical evacuation of hematoma. The proportion of subjects with initial GCS score of 13 or less was significantly higher among those who required surgical evacuation (43.2% vs. 26.8%, P < 0.001). In the logistics regression analysis, hematoma volume ≥18 cm3 (odds ratio, 4.3; 95% confidence interval, 2.1–8.8) and right-sided hematoma (odds ratio, 2.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.3–5.9) were significantly associated with surgical evacuation. Age, location, GCS score strata, and allocated treatment (intensive vs. standard systolic blood pressure reduction) were not associated with surgical evacuation. Among the 44 patients who underwent surgical evacuation, death or disability at 3 months postrandomization was seen in 32 (73%) of 44 subjects.
Conclusions
In the large cohort of ATACH 2 subjects with good grade ICH, the rates of unanticipated surgical evacuation were low and were associated with relatively high rates of death or disability at 3 months.}

Solid carbon derived from waste carton is utilized as fuel for direct carbon solid oxide fuel cells (DC-SOFCs) with the symmetric perovskite La0.3Sr0.7Fe0.7Ti0.3O3-δ electrodes and scandium stabilized zirconia electrolyte for power generation. The maximum output performance of this DC-SOFC is up to 307.8 mW cm-2 at 850 °C. The cell fueled by 0.2 g carbonated waste carton is operated at constant resistance discharging mode of 20 Ω, and 5.8 h discharging with a capacity of 658 C is represented. Ash of the carton fuel is collected after operation. Infrared spectrum and surface-enhanced Raman spectrum are employed to characterize tar from pyrolysis, and they show that tar contains many organic matters with a potential to be used as chemical raw materials. Energy dispersive spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction results show various inorganic salts and oxides in the ash, it means that the ash may be a promising candidate for fertilizer.}

The optimal content of EG in composite was confirmed as 16 wt% by heat treatment and DSC testing. The DSC testing results show that dodecane/EG shape-stabilized PCM has a phase change temperature of −9.67 °C and latent heat of 151.7 J/g. The microstructure of the dodecane/EG was characterized by SEM, FT-IR and specific surface area analyzer, and the results show that the dodecane was uniformly stuffed in the pore structure of EG under physical action. Thermal conductivity of the dodecane/EG is 15 times higher than that of dodecane. And the thermal conductivity enhancement of the composite PCM was also verified by the thermal performance test. Moreover, a numerical model of passive storage system with the dodecane/EG PCM was established and the simulation results are highly matched with the experimental result. In conclusion, the prepared dodecane/EG with noticeable thermal permeance and form stability and can be further applied in cold LHTES.}

Its development is especially important for the Arctic, which is an important energy region with easy access to the sea for the transportation of crude oil, liquefied natural gas and other resources. This investment area is a priority for Russia and a number of other countries, including China, since it promotes interests in energy and shipping field. Tankers with icebreaking capabilities delivering crude oil and natural gas from the Far East to Western markets account for about 45% of shipping on the Northern Sea Route (NSR). The rest of the transportation is carried out within the framework of the large Russian project “Yamal LNG” by ice-class tankers from the Sabetta port to Europe. However, the volume of sea traffic in the Arctic Ocean waters remains insignificant. In this regard, the article analyzes the economic and environmental aspects of possible expanding of using the NSR as an alternative route from Europe to Asia. Although the NSR is a direct route, the absence of transshipment points and transit ports complicates the conditions for transit goods carriage, and some route sections are too shallow for large container carriers. There are a number of other important operational constraints, including extreme climatic conditions and environmental issues: ships emissions, oil spills on ice. It is concluded that the pace of the Arctic projects implementation will directly determine traffic volume. To overcome barriers and restrictions that prevent the NSR’s transformation into a transport corridor for both Russia and international transit flows, it is necessary to implement projects for the Arctic support zones creation and development, as well as the modernization and expansion of the nuclear icebreaker fleet capacities. A method is proposed for calculating the time of cargo delivery, considering the multi-range of logistics chains based on the NSR.}

The results present the integration of qualitative information and quantitative data for building a hierarchical structure with sustainable supply chain capabilities and indicate that social, dynamic and information capabilities are simultaneously strongly affected.

abstract = {Aim
Allogenic hematopoietic cell transplantation (AlloHCT) is currently a curative cellular therapy approach in hematological malignancies of adults. Donor availability and eligibility of the recipient have been always the major steps on moving forward in alloHCT. Establishing a national registry is difficult task and present registries as partners of WMDA are serving worldwide on international platform. TURKOK is a new donor registry, established by Turkish Ministry of Health in 2015. The current grounds in donor availability/unrelated search is currently questioned by the rise in haplotype matched AlloHCT era. As a single active center since 2010, having performed more than 600 alloHCT, we analyzed the impact of TURKOK on our transplant kinetics and registry based outcome, hypothesizing faster kinetics for logistics and better survival using own citizens, who may have less disparity on HLA immunogenetics basis.
Material and Methods
One hundred and seventeen adult (17-72 years) patients who underwent AlloHCT using matched unrelated donors (MUD) at Florence Nightingale Hospital Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center between 2015 and 2019 were included in this study. Medical records of patients were reviewed retrospectively. Transplantation was performed in cases with high or very high DRI. The analysis have been performed on intent to treat basis, having AlloHCT as landmark. Our alloHCT activity using MUD started in 2012, among 127 AlloHCT performed MUD were provided from German BM Registry (DKMS) (n=80), TURKOK (n=38), from other national registries (non-DKMS) (n=9).
Results
The donors differ significantly only on CMV seropositivity, in TURKOK more than 90%, whereas in others less than 55% . Matching rate (%) 9/10-10/10 was nearly the same for DKMS, TURKOK and non-DKMS, 60-40, 66.7-33.3 and 55.3-44.7, respectively. In 2015 only 20% of the MUD AlloHCT were facilitated by TURKOK in our center whereas in 2018 more than 55%. Mean duration (SD1) from start of the donor search to infusion of HSC for DKMS, TURKOK and non-DKMS was 176.2 (142.3), 92 days (40.4) and 123 (63.4), respectively. The overall survival analysis at 2 years showed no statistical difference on log-rank analysis (p=0.24) (Figure 1).
Conclusion
Turkish national donor registry, TURKOK is serving faster as expected due to native donor candidates and facilitated logistics. The CMV donor positivity is clearly different in TURKOK, any impact on transplant outcome is still not clear. The HLA disparity is nearly the same on all three groups and survival analysis did not show any impact of national or international donor registry on transplant outcome. We concluded that TURKOK is serving faster and with similar impact on our alternative donor AlloHCT activity in comparison with international registries.}

To understand teachers’ perceptions about Breakfast in the Classroom and traditional breakfast.
Design
An electronic survey was sent to teachers across the state of Utah. Teachers responded to an open-ended question exploring what they liked and/or disliked about Breakfast in the Classroom and traditional breakfast.
Setting
Schools across the state of Utah.
Participants
Kindergarten through grade 12 teachers who were members of the Utah Education Association.
Phenomenon of Interest
Teachers’ opinions regarding Breakfast in the Classroom and traditional school breakfast
Analysis
Researchers independently coded all responses and then grouped codes into themes. Themes were reviewed recursively over time.
Results
The 3 overarching themes were food and nutrition, administration of school breakfast, and student outcomes. Aspects most commonly disliked were the nutrition or quality of food, the mess created, the time required, coordination and logistical issues, behavioral issues, and waste. Aspects most commonly liked were breakfast being available to all students, students being fed or not hungry, coordination and logistics, and student learning and academics.
Conclusions and Implications
Teachers liked and disliked aspects of Breakfast in the Classroom and traditional breakfast. Schools could potentially increase efforts to garner support and feedback from teachers to create buy-in and identify best practices. Future research could focus on identifying the effect that the School Breakfast Program model has on teachers’ perceptions as well as confirming results with a larger and more diverse population.}

SFAP may be taken in all possible orientations and directions relative to the ground target and sun position, which provides for unique lighting conditions. SFAP spans the scale range 1:100 to 1:1000 and, thus, bridges the gap between ground surveys and traditional remote sensing for wetland research.

Current cryopreservation procedures damage platelets, which may be caused by ice recrystallization. We hypothesized that the addition of a small molecule ice recrystallization inhibitor (IRI) to platelets prior to freezing may reduce cryopreservation-induced damage and/or improve the logistics of freezing and storage. Platelets were frozen using standard conditions of 5–6% dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) or with supplementation of an IRI, N-(2-fluorophenyl)-d-gluconamide (2FA), prior to storage at −80 °C. Alternatively, platelets were frozen with 5–6% Me2SO at −30 °C or with 3% Me2SO at −80 °C with or without 2FA supplementation. Supplementation of platelets with 2FA improved platelet recovery following storage under standard conditions (p = 0.0017) and with 3% Me2SO (p = 0.0461) but not at −30 °C (p = 0.0835). 2FA supplementation was protective for GPVI expression under standard conditions (p = 0.0011) and with 3% Me2SO (p = 0.0042). Markers of platelet activation, such as phosphatidylserine externalization and microparticle release, were increased following storage at −30 °C or with 3% Me2SO, and 2FA showed no protective effect. Platelet function remained similar regardless of 2FA, although functionality was reduced following storage at −30 °C or with 3% Me2SO compared to standard cryopreserved platelets. While the addition of 2FA to platelets provided a small level of protection for some quality parameters, it was unable to prevent alterations to the majority of in vitro parameters. Therefore, it is unlikely that ice recrystallization is the major cause of cryopreservation-induced damage.}

Extraneous leaf material, also known as post-harvest crop residue, represents a significant resource for use as a biomass feedstock by bioenergy industries. Information on temporal and varietal variation in sugarcane post-harvest crop residue is limited. Therefore, residue collected every two weeks during two harvest seasons from three commercial sugarcane varieties were analyzed for biomass quantity and quality. Residue biomass yields exceeded 3.5 t ha−1 y−1. When averaged over the two years and across the three varieties utilized, lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose, and ash content of residue were 4.7, 36.0, 31.5, and 0.7 %, respectively. Variety affected biomass, lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose, and ash yield, indicating there is some genetic variation in residue. Variability in lignin concentration was greatest; but, the overall concentrations in sugarcane residue were low. Both yield and quality changes over time within a season were consistent with the three varieties investigated in this study. Thus, harvest scheduling for sugarcane can be focused on varieties with the greatest sucrose concentration knowing that residue quality is stable across varieties.}

A consensus-building process among consumers, clinicians, and researchers used a participatory action process.
Setting
Community, hospitals, and universities.
Participants
More than 100 clinicians, researchers, and consumers and more than 1858 enrollees in the registry.
Main Outcome Measures
Not applicable.
Results
Consensus was that the purpose of registry was to (1) quantify practice variation, (2) facilitate quality improvement (QI), and (3) perform comparative effectiveness research (CER). Collecting data during routine clinical care using the electronic medical record was determined to be a sustainable plan for data acquisition and management. Clinicians from multiple disciplines defined salient characteristics of individuals and interventions for the registry elements. The registry was central to the clinical research network, and a leadership structure was created. A leading electronic health record platform adopted the registry elements. Twenty-four sites have initiated the data collection process and agreed to export data to the registry. Currently 12 are collecting data. Number of enrollees and characteristics were similar to other population registers.
Conclusions
This is the first multi-institutional CP registry that contains the patient and treatment characteristics needed for QI and CER. The Cerebral Palsy Research Network registry elements are implemented in a versatile electronic platform and minimize burden to clinicians. The resultant registry is available for any institution to participate and is growing rapidly.}

abstract = {When embedded in software-based decision support systems, optimization models can greatly improve organizational planning. In many industries, there are classical models that capture the fundamentals of general planning decisions (e.g., designing a delivery route). However, these models are generic and often require customization to truly reflect the realities of specific operational settings. Yet, such customization can be an expensive and time-consuming process. At the same time, popular cloud computing software platforms such as Software as a Service (SaaS) are not amenable to customized software applications. We present a framework that has the potential to autonomously customize optimization models by learning mathematical representations of customer-specific business rules from historical data derived from model solutions and implemented plans. Because of the wide-spread use in practice of mixed integer linear programs (MILP) and the power of MILP solvers, the framework is designed for MILP models. It uses a common mathematical representation for different optimization models and business rules, which it encodes in a standard data structure. As a result, a software provider employing this framework can develop and maintain a single code-base while meeting the needs of different customers. We assess the effectiveness of this framework on multiple classical MILPs used in the planning of logistics and supply chain operations and with different business rules that must be observed by implementable plans. Computational experiments based on synthetic data indicate that solutions to the customized optimization models produced by the framework are regularly of high-quality.}

abstract = {In this paper, a battery swap station location and routing problem with time windows and a mixed fleet of electric and conventional vehicles (BSS–MF–LRPTW) is proposed. This problem is motivated by a real-life logistics application by extending the existing electric vehicle battery swap stations location routing problem (BSS–EV–LRP). The BSS–MF–LRPTW aims to simultaneously determine the locations of battery swap stations (BSSs) and the routing plan of a mixed fleet under the driving range, the load capacity limitation, and time windows. An integer programming (IP) model is developed for the proposed BSS–MF–LRPTW. As there are a large number of variables and complicating constraints of the IP model, we break it up into the master problem and the subproblem, based on Danzig–Wolfe decomposition. To enhance the tractability of the problem, we follow up with a heuristic branch-and-price algorithm with an adaptive selection scheme (HBP-ASS), which integrates the exact policy with a heuristic strategy. The HBP-ASS develops heuristic versions of the dynamic programming algorithm by designing seven operators for heuristic label extension and dominance. An adaptive selection scheme is presented to decide which operator is employed. The performance of the proposed HBP-ASS is evaluated based on an extensive computational study. The results show that the HBP-ASS can obtain the exact solution to small-scale instances much more quickly than commercial branch-and-bound/cut solvers such as CPLEX. Also, for all tested cases, the HBP-ASS can find better solutions to large-scale instances within a shorter time than the existing heuristics – adaptive large neighborhood search. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses are carried out to provide managerial insights.}

abstract = {In the last three decades, an integrated approach to optimize logistics system is considered as one of the most important aspects of optimizing supply chain management. This approach involves the ties between locations of facility, allocation of suppliers/customers, structure of transportation routes and inventory control. The aim of this paper is to investigate the ordering planning of a supply chain with multi supplier, multi distribution center, multi customer and one perishable raw material. This paper provides a mathematical model taking in consideration the limitation of raw material corruptibility (perishable material) which belongs to the category of NP-hard problems. To solve the proposed model, the Ant Colony Optimization algorithm (ACO) and Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (PSO) are employed. In order to improve performances of ACO and PSO parameters, a Taguchi experimental design method was applied to set their proper values. Besides, to evaluate the performance of the proposed model, an example of the dairy industry is analyzed by using MATLAB R 2015a. To validate the proposed meta-heuristic algorithms, the results of them were compared with together. The results of the comparison show that ACO is greater than PSO in speed convergence rate and the number of solutions iterations.}

abstract = {The Arctic Region experienced a series of significant changes due to shifting climate conditions, resulting in multiple opportunities and challenges for international actors, and encouraging both Arctic and non-Arctic states to promote their own national interests. Hence, the region has become a global priority, and a focus of scientific studies across the Natural Sciences, and Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) disciplines. This study systematically analyses the literature on the Arctic Region, conducting a multidimensional bibliometric analysis and content analysis on the basis of semantic clustering. The purpose of the analysis is to determine future Arctic-related research themes. The study follows a three-level research framework. The first level of the analysis highlights a disciplinary shift in the Arctic literature from Natural Sciences towards Social Sciences and Humanities, particularly, focusing on the environment, technology, political and energy-related issues. The second level identifies 9 research themes which are validated in the third level. The third level reveals the most prominent terms and prioritized research areas in the Arctic literature, namely, Governance, Security Issues, Economic Factors, Legal Issues, Energy and Natural Resources, Logistics, Climate Change and Environment, Technology, and Socio-cultural and Ethnic Issues.}

abstract = {After entering a new market (such as China and India), the full-fledged supply bases and networks (e.g., material, worker, logistics services, et al.) induce many multinational firms (MNFs) to produce and sell products using local materials. However, government’s random environmental inspection, weather disaster, and other accidents have resulted in supply disruption for local sourcing. In this paper, we study how operational decisions such as pricing, ordering, and the selection of sourcing structure between Overseas Sourcing (OS) and Domestic Sourcing (DS) help improve supply chain sustainability. We study both the economic and environmental sustainability performances under alternative sourcing structures (OS and DS), where we identify a win-win situation. Interestingly, the MNF’s profit difference between DS and OS is non-monotonic in its brand image advantage, because the domestic supplier might snatch the MNF’s “brand value” using the pricing power, resulting a high local sourcing price. When the MNF’s brand image advantage and the unit pollution/quantity ratio are both small, the MNF obtains more profits and incurs less pollutant under DS.}

abstract = {Over the last few years, immunotherapy for HIV in general and therapeutic vaccination in particular, has received a tremendous boost, both in preclinical research and in clinical applications. This interest is based on the evidence that the immune system plays a crucial role in controlling HIV infection, as shown for long-term non-progressors and elite controllers, and that immune responses can be manipulated towards targeting conserved epitopes. So far, the most successful approach has been vaccination with autologous dendritic cells (DCs) loaded ex vivo with antigens and activation signals. Although this approach offers much promise, it also comes with significant drawbacks such as the requirement of a specialized infrastructure and expertise, as well as major challenges for logistics and storage, making it extremely time consuming and costly. Therefore, methods are being developed to avoid the use of ex vivo generated, autologous DCs. One of these methods is based on mRNA for therapeutic vaccination. mRNA has proven to be a very promising vaccine platform, as the coding information for any desired protein, including antigens and activation signals, can be generated in a very short period of time, showing promise both as an off-the-shelf therapy and as a personalized approach. However, an important drawback of this approach is the short half-life of native mRNA, due to the presence of ambient RNases. In addition, proper immunization requires that the antigens are expressed, processed and presented at the right immunological site (e.g. the lymphoid tissues). An ambivalent aspect of mRNA as a vaccine is its capacity to induce type I interferons, which can have beneficial adjuvant effects, but also deleterious effects on mRNA stability and translation. Thus, proper formulation of the mRNA is crucially important. Many approaches for RNA formulation have already been tested, with mixed success. In this review we discuss the state-of-the-art and future trends for mRNA-nanoparticle formulations for HIV vaccination, both in the prophylactic and in the therapeutic setting.}

abstract = {Introduction: As of July 31, 2021, 5 CAR-T therapies have been approved in the U.S. to treat lymphomas (large B cell, follicular, and mantle cell), acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and multiple myeloma. These individualized, autologous cell therapies are expensive; involve complex manufacturing, transportation, and storage requirements; and have a unique set of serious adverse events associated with their use. Thus, the use of CAR-T therapies is limited mainly to tertiary care centers that have been licensed to administer these agents. Over half of all U.S. patients with cancer are treated in community-based oncology practices. Understanding the adoption of novel therapies by community hematologists/oncologists (cH/O) is critical to assessing their future utilization and impact on clinical outcomes in the real-world setting. We have assessed CAR-T adoption among cH/O in lymphoma (Gajra et al. Immunotherapy. PMID: 32552151) and with the expansion in number of agents and indications, we sought to assess the evolution of their use of, referrals for, and barriers to CAR-T therapy. Methods: Between January and April 2021, oncologists from across the U.S. were invited to complete a web-based survey about their CAR-T therapy utilization, referral patterns, barriers experienced, and overall impression of this class of therapy. Participant demographics and practice characteristics were also captured in the survey. Participants were not aware of the specific content of the survey as other areas in hematology/oncology were also addressed. Participants were compensated for their participation. Responses were aggregated and analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: Of the 371 cH/O invited, 100% completed the survey; 63% identified their primary specialty as hematology oncology and 36% medical oncology. The median time in practice was 16 years with a median of 20 patients seen per day on clinic days. The top 3 hematologic malignancies treated by survey participants are CLL, AML, and B-cell NHL. Among the participants, 72% and 53% have referred patients for CAR-T therapy since the first approval and the preceding 6 months respectively; 16% of those who referred in preceding 6 months, reported that none of their referrals ultimately received the CAR-T product infusion. The top 2 barriers impacting timely referral for these participants include a slow approval process by payers (34%) and a slow intake process at the CAR-T center itself (23%). While patient deterioration is a significant challenge to 40% of the participants, other CAR-T center-related challenges perceived by the participants include the CAR-T product not being manufactured, lack of communication from the CAR-T center during the process, and lack of clear instructions to the referring oncologist about follow-up care. Common perceived barriers to prescribing/recommending CAR-T therapy include lack of long-term survival data (14%), therapy-related toxicity (30%), cumbersome logistics of administration (37%), and cost (39%). Among 309 participants queried about cost, 60% feel the price is acceptable for this breakthrough therapy. To facilitate their prescribing/recommendation of CAR-T therapies, the participants agreed that better support to community providers regarding post therapy management, easier referral process to CAR-T centers, timelier approval from payers, and more long-term clinical trial and real-world data are needed. As more CAR-T therapies gain approval and come to market, additional resources requested by the participants included more financial aid/support for patients (59%), more education for prescribing physicians (53%) and patients (29%), more decision support tools (38%), and better coordination and communication between community physicians and sites of care (37%). Conclusions: Most cH/O surveyed have referred patients for CAR-T therapies in hematologic malignancies but there is room for improvement in the referral and intake process as well as the treatment and post-infusion phase. Significant barriers of logistics and cost are potential deterrents to appropriate use. cH/O would welcome additional resources to aid the utilization of CAR-T. These results can inform stakeholders (manufacturers, payers, hospitals, and practices) regarding the need to improve processes and develop payment models to address cost in order to facilitate access of these agents to the appropriate patients.

Early 2016, patient treatment using MRgRT was started at Amsterdam UMC, location VU University Medical Center. Introducing this novel technique in clinical practice requires thorough preparation with regard to important topics, such as MR-safety and training, equipping the treatment vault and console room, development of MRgRT workflow and logistical issues. Certainly when MRgRT is combined with daily plan adaptation, this indicates adjusting existing workflows and protocols. The MRgRT workflow requires a multidisciplinary process, and while each discipline has had its own tasks and responsibilities, with growing clinical experience there has been a shift towards RTT responsibilities. In this overview we discuss preclinical training and preparation for the implementation of (adaptive) MRgRT, with a particular focus on the perspective of RTTs. Although the reviewed logistics are partly the result of the decision to perform daily plan re-optimization, our experience can be extrapolated to implementation of alternative approaches for MRgRT.}

abstract = {Background
The coronavirus identified in 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic effectively ended all major spine educational conferences in the first half of 2020. In response, the authors formed a “virtual” case-based conference series directed at delivering spine education to health care providers around the world. We herein share the technical logistics, early participant feedback, and future direction of this initiative.
Methods
The Virtual Global Spine Conference (VGSC) was created in April 2020 by a multiinstitutional team of spinal neurosurgeons and a neuroradiologist. Biweekly virtual meetings were established wherein invited national and international spine care providers would deliver case-based presentations on spine and spine surgery−related conditions via teleconferencing. Promotion was coordinated through social media platforms such as Twitter.
Results
VGSC recruited more than 1000 surgeons, trainees, and other specialists, with 50–100 new registrants per week thereafter. An early survey to the participants, with 168 responders, indicated that 92% viewed the content as highly valuable to their practice and 94% would continue participating post COVID-19. Participants from the United States (29%), Middle East (16%), and Europe (12%) comprised the majority of the audience. Approximately 52% were neurosurgeons, 18% orthopedic surgeons, and 6% neuroradiologists. A majority of participants were physicians (55%) and residents/fellows (21%).
Conclusions
The early success of the VGSC reflects a strong interest in spine education despite the COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing guidelines. There is widespread opinion, backed by our own survey results, that many clinicians and trainees want to see “virtual” education continue post COVID-19.}
