abstract = {This paper addresses an essential loading optimization problem arising in the outbound logistics of automobiles. The problem is to assign a set of orders of finished cars to a set of heterogeneous auto-carriers and to deliver these finished cars from a depot to multiple destinations. The involved destinations are located within a relatively small distance to the depot. A value corresponding to each order represents its urgency level, and an inter-set cost is defined among destinations to estimate the related transportation cost. The objective of the problem is to maximize the weighted total value of the assigned orders minus the total inter-set cost subject to a full-load constraint and a downward compatible loading structure. An integer programming model and a column generation based algorithm are proposed. The proposed algorithm is implemented based on serial and parallel programming, respectively. Computational results based on randomly generated instances and a case study with real data show that the proposed algorithm can generate near-optimality solutions efficiently, and outperforms solving the integer programming model by an IP solver and a rule-based method applied in practice.}

Accordingly, this study focuses on the city logistics problem with respect to policy decisions regarding the use of light commercial vehicles through urban consolidation schemes in a way to minimise carbon emissions and, thus, total transportation costs. In particular, this study has developed a mathematical model to minimise total transportation costs including routing costs, vehicle fixed costs, emission costs, and zone entry fees. The proposed model is solved using a modified ant colony optimisation (MACO) technique. The optimal results are obtained within CPU time, and results are validated using the ACO algorithm and the Cplex solver. Meanwhile, different supporting policies are introduced, and computational experiments are executed on a real-life case study. Results show that the purchase subsidy and zone entry fee are significant considerations when promoting electric vehicles (EVs) in city logistics.}

abstract = {The temporariness of construction supply chains, in combination with the multiplicity of stakeholders complicates the organization of construction logistics. The problem for cities today is not the construction materials’ transports as such, it is how to ensure accessibility and mobility for stakeholders during the construction time. In general, there is no tradition of including different stakeholder perspectives when evaluating construction logistics setups. However, in other urban freight transport applications, multi-stakeholder dialogues are more common, and one methodology suggested and used as a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) method is the Multi-Actor Multi-Criteria Analysis (MAMCA). In this paper we develop a customized methodology for applying MAMCA in a construction logistics context, gradually refining the methodology along five cases in three different countries. We show how MAMCA must be adapted to fit the construction context. The main differences are: (1) predefined construction logistics alternatives, (2) predefined actors and criteria groups, and (3) the possibility of using the method in role play to create awareness of stakeholder views in homogenous groups. The methodology proved to be valuable for (1) identifying relevant stakeholders and their criteria, (2) identifying and understanding stakeholders’ preferences regarding construction logistics, and (3) creating awareness of the need to initiate construction logistics in a project. Furthermore, it showed the need to clarify whom is to take responsibility for initiating the use of construction logistics setups.}

This research aims to fill such gap. Focusing on the Tokyo Metropolitan Area, we analyze locations and goods vehicle trips associated with four logistics facility groups that have different splits between intra and inter-regional trips for inbound and outbound shipments. The spatial density analysis and the location choice modeling highlight the differences in the distribution and location choice factors among those groups. The importance of trip distance minimization is more evident for the facilities that serve intra-regional shipments. Furthermore, we show that the traffic impacts of goods vehicle traffic associated with logistics facilities also differ in many ways among the above-mentioned groups. Finally, we discuss the policy insights to address their heterogeneity in the contribution to externality.}

Hence, this topic is relevant in the current Indian context. This paper explores the RL practices that drive operational efficiency while promoting cleaner production. This study aims to identify the barriers to RL implementation and bring together a practical approach to overcome all the relevant barriers in the RL sector in the Indian context. The survey of previous literature suggests that researchers have tried to prioritise barriers to RL implementation. However, this paper intends to analyse the barriers from a CE perspective and propose a framework for developing strategies with a structured implementation for managers in India’s RL industry. Effects of these barriers have been analysed, while concurrently developing strategies to mitigate them and gauge the impact of strategies on the system of barriers using an evaluation model developed by incorporating quantitative techniques-grey-DEMATEL (Decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory), agglomerative hierarchical clustering, fuzzy measure and fuzzy integral. The study aims to serve as a guiding framework for decision-makers to identify the barriers in their organisations and map the barriers to contemporary strategies to tackle them. The insights from the analysis show difficulty in managing quality of circular goods as the prominent barrier followed by a lack of responsibility and initiation by top management. Key strategies identified to mitigate the barriers are classified into priority, long-term, contingency, and non-priority zones. Consumer education, proper logistics network utilisation and efficient warehousing are key strategies that companies should adopt on a priority basis.}

In particular, logistic complexes should ensure continuous development on the basis of actions and determine the possibility of reducing the maximum amount of downtime when a larger number of participants in the transport chain are involved. The relevance of the present study is determined by the fact that a considerable number of solutions for logistics chains use only the mechanism of economic benefits without optimizing the engineering component. The novelty of this study is that the logistics chain is presented as a comprehensive engineering project that can be implemented on the basis of optimization solutions for the components used. The use of such tools can be based not only on the principles of a direct engineering solution, but also on local micro-logistical systems. The economic rationale for the proposed system and its elements is provided. Practical use of the proposed solution can be implemented on the principles of integration into large industrial systems. The study can be extended to the application of technologies of decentralized logistical systems.}

Multiple stakeholders from the public and private domain, each with different perspectives and aims, compose a local urban freight logistics system, and decide upon prioritization of such policies. Cognitive consensus or similarity regarding the conceptualization of the decision problem across stakeholders optimizes decision quality at the system level but is challenging to achieve. The aim of this paper is to provide empirical evidence of a stakeholder participation approach pursuing cognitive consensus to develop and prioritize urban freight logistics policies. Our approach involves stakeholders from the public and private domain and builds upon the Analytic Hierarchy Process, embedded in a broader action research framework that allows for iterations of the decision-making process. We provide evidence of the appropriateness of the triple bottom line perspective to conceptualize policy outcomes at a system level. We illustrate the importance of the uncovering and sharing of assumptions behind the operationalization of policies given local circumstances. Finally, we find that knowledge exchange across stakeholders causes shifts in priorities established by each stakeholder, confirming the relevance of structured stakeholder involvement in the policy-making process.}

Furthermore, the rapid developments of Chinese new cities provides an opportunity to implement innovative ULS freight transport systems and technology that are efficient and sustainable. Recently, ULS has been included officially in the planning and study for Beijing’s Sub-Center, the Yangtze River Demonstration District and other new cities and districts. However, the real value of ULS will not materialize unless it is successfully implemented. This paper presents the exploration, observations and findings of a few proposed ULS planning and research works in the new districts mentioned. The suitability of goods and freight types in ULS, logistic flow demand forecasting and ULS network systems integrated with underground metro or infrastructure are discussed. Both dedicated and integrated ULS network systems are also compared and analyzed. Despite the many advantages, many challenges and difficulties remain in the planning integration, technology adaptation and implementation of ULSs in new districts and cities, thus, interdisciplinary collaborations is one of the key success factors to ensure ULS can be brought to fruition.}

Transport infrastructure and logistics are important inputs in the supplying of goods abroad and in the sourcing of intermediates. To account for the emergence and proliferation of Global Value Chains (GVCs) that have significantly changed the way of organizing production and distribution of goods, we measure export performance by value added in exports rather than gross exports used in the empirical studies on sources of comparative advantage. Using exporter-importer-year, importer-industry-year and exporter-industry fixed effects, we find that a country's ability to provide high-quality transport infrastructure and logistics is a source of comparative advantage in the logistics intensive industries. The results are robust to an alternative measure of transport infrastructure quality and a number of alternative specifications. Even with changes in the sample of countries, the quality of transport infrastructure and logistics continues to be an important determinant of comparative advantage. These findings suggest that transport policies to improve the quality of transport infrastructure and logistics contribute to acquiring comparative advantage.}

To simultaneously address these issues, we propose a comprehensive cold-chain-based low-carbon location-routing-problem optimization model to minimize the total logistics costs and client and vehicle waiting time. The first objective comprises the fixed costs of depots to open and vehicles to rent, vehicle renting cost, driver salaries, fuel consumption cost, carbon emission costs, and damage costs of cargos that need to be refrigerated or frozen. The second objective consists of the waiting time of clients and vehicles to improve client satisfaction and the efficiency of the cold chain logistics network. In the proposed problem, we developed a strategy for improving the efficiency of the cold chain logistics network by mixing the types of cargos arranged in one vehicle. Aiming at efficiently solving the proposed model, six well-known multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) were used by combining an efficient framework, and first (FI) and best-improvement (BI) search mechanisms were considered. In the experiments, we examined the effectiveness of six MOEAs inserting the proposed framework and search mechanisms, and the result showed that NSGA-II/FI, SPEA2/FI, and NSGA-II/BI were the top three MOEAs. In the extensive experiments, the results showed that the delivery strategy, depot cost, depot capacity, crowding distance, and traveling speed have significant effects on the Pareto front, fuel consumption, carbon emission, vehicle and client waiting times, traveling distance, and traveling time.}

This article proposes a new paradigm to deal with industrial and societal challenges, developing an auction-enabled collaborative routing mechanism for omnichannel on-demand logistics in a real-time transshipment network. We consider an online service platform for real-time management of on-demand pickup and delivery tasks, where multiple freight shippers can trade with multiple freight carriers. Freight shippers are retailers or individual customers, while freight carriers are a group of logistics service providers. The platform acts as the auctioneer. A two-stage combinational auction mechanism is designed for dynamic on-demand task (re)allocation. Tactical-level auctioning and operational-level routing decisions are optimized together. The transshipment-based task generation method is used to identify uneconomic paths from carrier’s real-time network for outsourcing. A transshipment-based routing algorithm is developed to enable each carrier to make decentralized decisions for network reconstruction and transportation bidding. Our model aims to improve the overall social welfare while bringing benefits to stakeholders involved. The computational results have shown positive society impacts. Specifically, shippers’ payments can be saved while carriers’ profits are increased compared with other operative models which have been investigated in previous research studies or industry. In addition, a substantial reduction in CO2 emissions and vehicles required can be achieved. The main reason for the improvement in social welfare is due to the optimal network achieved through collaboration. We also numerically analyze the impacts of three key factors: growth in demand density, urgency of tasks and flexible auction interval.}

Using a stylized analytical model, we then propose that “mobile warehouse” can be an effective solution to last-mile logistics issues faced during COVID-19 and beyond under certain conditions. A mobile warehouse is a truck dedicated to a particular geographical location and carries the inventory of various products based on the estimated demand requirements for these products in that geographical location.

Based on cost evaluation, fees that consignees and couriers should pay respectively are determined based on beneficiary-pay principle. The results of our empirical analyses show that the value of the locker service varies with the terms of express delivery and the availability uncertainty of whether consignees are present at the designated receiving sites, which provides a fundamental pricing basis for locker service providers to charge the couriers or the consignees.}

To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first efforts to evaluate the effects of the multiplicative relationships between the uncertain elements, e.g. currency exchange rate and carbon trading prices. In the proposed model, the economic and the environmental performances of a GRLN are evaluated by the robustness coefficient. The application of the model is demonstrated in a sample case of the PWR between China and Belgium. The analysis shows that a lower robustness coefficient leads to a higher cost of the GRLN, but lower emissions. It is worthy to note that considering the maritime emission is not definite to guarantee global net sustainability. Moreover, a social GRLN network leads to a more cost-efficient system compared to developing two recycling networks individually in the importing and the exporting countries.}

abstract = {Despite the growing research interests on the spatial restructuring of logistics facilities that occurred in many cities around the world, the relationship between the spatial pattern of logistics land use and the level of externalities is far from being elucidated. We use the Urban Logistics Land-use and Traffic Simulator (ULLTRA-SIM), developed for the Tokyo Metropolitan Area, to evaluate the level of externalities that accompany different spatial distribution patterns of logistics facilities. The ULLTRA-SIM takes a novel approach to analyze the urban freight impacts through the simulations of logistics facility locations, urban logistics chains, and truck flow. The results indicate that, while the moderate concentration and deconcentration of logistics facilities do not significantly affect the level of externalities, scarcity of logistics facilities in or near the high demand locations exacerbates negative externalities. Also, the results of the simulations underscore the need for rigorous analysis in order to reduce negative externalities through logistics land use policies.}

Moreover, existing systems fall short of providing traceability, transparency, information security, and immutability of data stored and exchanged during various operational pro- cesses. As a result, the productivity of port terminals is adversely affected. Blockchain is an emerging technology that provides traceability, transparency, auditability through immutable prove- nance data of on-chain trusted transactions, in a decentralized manner without intermediaries or trusted third parties. In this paper, we discuss the potential role of blockchain technology in transforming port logistic operations and services, provide use cases and frameworks that improve port logistics operations. Furthermore, we employ permissioned blockchain architectures to map port logistics services to highlight system components, participants, and deployment alternatives to automate logistics operations.

For this, a supply chain mapping with its direct and reverse flows was performed, the main variables of interest were listed and the characteristics that define its performance were analyzed. The modeling was conducted through System Dynamics, since this tool allows to consider the main factors at an enough level of abstraction to simulate scenarios. The analysis focused on the variables: material reuse (environmental), waste of resources (environmental), cost of storage (economic) and unemployment (social). To measure them, the indicators recycling ratio I and II, storage cost and job creation ratio were evaluated. The simulation showed that not all actions listed to improve the reverse logistics system benefit simultaneously the three pillars of sustainability. In addition, some existing trade-offs should be considered as well as the implementation of combined actions for better results. The simulations performed for three scenarios also revealed that indicators such as storage costs, recycling ratio and employment ratio improve reverse chain performance with the adoption of intermediate integrated solutions. The information presented in this article can support managers in decision making in their companies and contribute to broaden the debates about reverse logistics systems.}

abstract = {Sustainability is increasingly viewed as a desired goal of social development. The logistics industry without exception is aware of the importance of sustainable development. To achieve this goal, the logistics industry is leveraging cutting-edge technologies, such as product service systems (PSS) and cloud manufacturing (CMfg), to design logistics product service systems (LPSS). In LPSS, public logistics resources are allocated to customers and private logistics resources are shared between customers. However, logistics resource allocation and sharing services have been impeded by a lack of efficient methods. In this context, this paper proposes an auction-based cloud service allocation and sharing method for LPSS. Firstly, LPSS is defined and elaborated based on the adoption of PSS in the logistics industry. Secondly, multi-unit Vickery (MV) auctions and one-sided Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (O-VCG) combinatorial auctions are proposed to address logistics resource allocation and sharing problems respectively in LPSS. Two auctions are introduced specifically, and their relevant properties are investigated, including incentive compatibility, allocative efficiency, budget balance, and individual rationality. Thirdly, computational studies are conducted to examine the performance of two auctions. The results reveal that MV auctions can efficiently allocate public logistics resources through ensuring the utility of logistics service providers under dynamic supply and demand. Additionally, O-VCG auctions can effectively integrate and share idle private logistics resources, which promotes sustainability in the logistics industry. Through integrating MV auctions with O-VCG auctions, the utility of logistics service providers can be increased.}

The retailer can apply for bank financing or 3PL financing for purchasing when necessary. All members engage in a Stackelberg game with the supplier functioning as the leader. Our analysis indicates that the 3PL who finances the retailer with a low interest rate induces the retailer to order more, thereby causing the 3PL to obtain more profit from logistics services. The supplier benefits from 3PL financing by receiving a larger order from the retailer. Compared with bank financing, a retailer whose working capital level is not too low can benefit more with 3PL financing owing to lower purchasing (ordering and transportation costs) and financing costs. We further conclude that all members’ optimal decisions remain unchanged when the 3PL is also capital constrained but can borrow from a bank. We examine the retailer and supplier’s issues when the 3PL functions as the game leader instead of the supplier, and numerically demonstrate that the retailer and 3PL are better off while the supplier is worse off under 3PL leadership. Our results explain why 3PLs are willing to finance retailers’ inventories in business practice and suggest that 3PLs should set low financing interest rates to improve channel performances.}

In addition to this direct link, whether corporate governance moderates this relation or not is tested. The analysis of data collected for 117 countries covers the period from 2007 to 2016. Primarily, the study provides robust evidence that green logistics performance has a significant and positive association with the existence and the number of sustainability reports within the logistics sector. This association is validated for the composite Logistics Performance Index (LPI) as well as all six individual logistics performance indicators. Furthermore, moderation analysis indicated that in weak corporate governance environments characterized by ineffective boards of directors, the logistics performance and sustainability reporting link is stronger. This means that sustainability reporting fills the gap arising from poor corporate governance. This study extends existing green supply chain management literature by testing, for the first time, the association between green logistics practices and sustainability reporting. It is hoped that it helps to align the logistics sector with more eco-friendly practices and alleviate growing concerns of environmental degradation it is assumed to cause. In the end, the study provides implications for sector representatives, supply-chain managers, and developing countries in particular. It suggests guidelines about how to improve each dimension of six LPI to contribute to the sustainable development of the sector. Moreover, as one of the dimensions of this study is sustainability reporting, communication of sustainable supply chain practices to customers and other stakeholders may help supply chain managers augment the competitive posture of companies in the market. The sector can benefit from the Global Reporting Initiative’s individual metrics including materials usage, energy efficiency, recycling, and waste management metrics in developing environmentally friendly supply chains. The findings are particularly relevant for developing countries which are quite low scorers in terms of LPI than developed countries. Engaging in green logistics practices and developing policies accordingly may help them attenuate growing international environmental concerns and overcome trade barriers in international trade. The highlighted dimensions of green logistics performance may foster the circular economy while promoting the overall economic development of the countries.}

The transportation planning process is assisted by solving the Logistics Service Network Design Problem (LSNDP). As realistic instances are too large for on-the-shelf optimization solvers to solve in acceptable run-times, we develop a network reduction heuristic inspired by the recent Dynamic Discretization Discovery algorithm. Through an extensive series of experiments carried out on instances based on the operations of an industrial partner, we demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach. We also investigate the impact of the distribution strategy used in practice to determine the transportation plan and how this distribution strategy can be modified to reduce the overall logistics costs.}

We consider integrated strategic network design and operational routing decisions over a multi-period time horizon, accounting for mixed fleets of electric and conventional vehicles and battery degradation. To solve this problem, we develop a novel matheuristic that embeds a state-of-the-art metaheuristic to take operational routing decisions. With this framework, we analyze a possible transition towards electrified logistics fleets. Starting with a real-world case, we perform sensitivity analyses based on a technology roadmap and further network structures. We discuss cost structures, the time-dependent nature of investment decisions, operational characteristics, and potential emissions savings. We show that in certain cases an electrification of mid-haul logistics fleets is operationally feasible, economically viable, and provides environmental advantages.}

The thermal properties of DA-LA/EG CPCM are analyzed by DSC, cooling curve, Hot Disk, SEM etc. From the DSC graphs of DA-LA eutectic phase change material (EPCM), it is found that there is difference between the melting temperature and solidification temperature, which is defined as phase change hysteresis. The results indicate that the phase transition temperature of DA-LA/EG CPCM is 2.08 °C, with high latent heat and thermal conductivity of 188.71 J g−1 and 1.7527 W m−1 K−1, respectively. Due to the unique porous structure of EG, the thermal conductivity is 13.75 times higher than that without EG, which leads to the phase transition time shortened by 79.47%. Furthermore, DA-LA/EG CPCM shows excellent cyclic stability and chemical stability after 500 high-low temperature alternating tests. From TGA, the decomposition temperature of DA-LA/EG CPCM is 186.55 °C, higher than the working temperature range. The applicability is demonstrated by using the CPCM into an incubator. Overall, DA-LA/EG CPCM has good application prospects in vaccine cold chain logistics.}

Secondly, it analyzed the effect of SLP on carbon emissions using a difference-in-differences (DID) model. The results reveal that freight volume, logistics employment, and total social retail are important factors determining whether a city should establish Smart Logistics or not. Additionally, the decision whether to establish Smart Logistics is an exogenous policy variable to carbon emissions. The implementation of SLP can restrain carbon emissions significantly, with a continuous impact in the second year.

abstract = {In the last decades there has been great concern about sustainability, especially in companies, where the concept of sustainable development is no longer a trend, but a reality. In the logistics field it should not be any different, since it´s importance to the movement of goods and people. This movement is carried out by four transportation modals, road, air, rail and river. The road transportation is widely used in relation to the others, bringing some problems in large urban centers like traffic jams, climate change, pollution, high CO2 emissions, among others. Thus, it is currently a great challenge to make the logistics greener, balancing logistic modals, reducing freight transport by road and shift to other modals. The inland waterway transport in this context stands out, since it is the most sustainable transportation in logistics, besides having lower costs. Based on this information, this study aims to discover the main challenges and opportunities for the development of river logistics as a sustainable alternative. Using a systemic approach the research analyzed articles of the river logistics field from the last five years. It was possible to identify the main challenges and opportunities in the articles, guide surveys to fill the main gaps, and shows a discussion to better understand the situation considering what actions are being taken and what are needed for the river logistics development.}

Affected by COVID-19, government administrators establish cross-regional quarantine roadblocks to reduce the risk of virus transmission caused by cross-regional transportation. In this study, we propose an emergency logistics network design problem with resource sharing under collaborative alliances. We construct a state–space–time network-based bi-objective mixed integer programming model to optimize the vehicle routes in order to meet customer demands for essential materials with the lowest cost and highest emergency response speed under limited transportation resources. A two-stage hybrid heuristic algorithm is then proposed to find good-quality solutions for the problem. Clustering results are obtained using a 3D k-means clustering algorithm with the consideration of time and space indices. The optimization of the initial population generated by the improved Clarke and Wright saving method and improved nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-II with elite retention strategy provides stable and excellent performance for the searching of Pareto frontier. The cost difference of the entire emergency logistics network before and after collaboration, i.e., the profit, is fairly allocated to the participants (i.e., logistics service providers) through the Shapley value method. A real-world case in Chongqing City, China is used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm. This study contributes to smart transportation and logistics system in emergency planning and has particular implications for the optimal response of existing logistics system to the current COVID-19 pandemic.}

This leads to problems in efficiently allocating supplies to vessels and cost-effectively assessing the fleet size. Aiming to solve these problems, we propose a framework based on the integration of a mixed-integer programming model, which selects the supply set each vessel should provide, and a discrete-event simulator, which realistically represents the offshore operation scenario. We evaluate different fleet management policies, such as distinguishing parts of a fleet with respect to commodity type and multi-commodity transportation. In addition, we analyze the cargo allocation and vessel assignment along scheduled trips, comparing the traditional first-in-first-out delivery strategy with a completely optimization-centered alternative. Our study presents good-quality solutions that can potentially enhance offshore service levels, reduce fleet requirement, and decrease operational costs. We also demonstrate that our framework promotes a further step for improving the current logistics practices of a major oil company operating in Brazilian oil and gas offshore basins.}

Grounded in the continuum theory, the model is deduced with rigorous derivation, and the results show that the proposed model can accurately reflect the degree distribution of the international logistics network, which follows a shifted power law. Simulation experiments are conducted to demonstrate the interaction process, and the simulated network presents a hierarchical pattern of “several central nodes and a large number of peripheral nodes”. China, South Korea, India, Indonesia and the Russian Federation are considered central nodes and have a significant influence on the B&R international logistics network.}

Meanwhile, Incidents like the current global pandemic have further exacerbated such a challenge by causing fluctuations in online demand for products like groceries. To address this, e-retailers can adopt third-party logistics providers (3PLs) as business partners. Specifically, this paper aims to address freight shipping fulfillment policies by considering an e-channel where an e-retailer (e.g., e-grocer) has a limited in-house shipping fleet and can hire additional shipping services from a 3PL to encounter demand volatility. We evaluate and compare two different contracts from the perspective of the e-retailer/3PL and e-channel: (1) a conventional contract in which the e-retailer hires shipping services from a 3PL in advance, but in case of not exercising units of hired service, incurs a penalty, and (2) an option contract in which the e-retailer can reserve/exercise shipping services from 3PL who decides on contract terms. We find that when e-channel demand volatility is high the option contract results in e-channel coordination, and both parties are better off. We further demonstrate that when e-channel demand volatility is low, the option contract is detrimental for the e-retailer and a profitable case for 3PL. Thus, the e-retailer prefers to participate in the conventional contract, as opposed to the priority of 3PL and e-channel.}

But the energy involved in the bale aggregation logistics using ABP has not been thoroughly evaluated. Therefore, the energy involved in the bale aggregation, in terms of fuel consumption, was studied for different logistic scenarios using a tractor (control) and ABP through a user-developed simulation program in R. Different variables such as field areas (8 to 259 ha), biomass yields (3–40 Mg ha−1), four outlet locations, and five equipment speeds (6.6–10.5 km h−1) using realistic equipment turning paths were used in the simulation. The Nebraska Tractor Test general method and fuel efficiency method were considered for the fuel consumption calculations. Fuel consumption for the ABP (8–259 ha) with 8 BPT on an average decreased by 72 % and 53 % compared to a tractor with 1 and 2 BPT, respectively, based on logistics distance and equipment operation. Field area, biomass yield, and BPT were the most influential variables affecting logistics distance; while, field area, biomass yield, BPT, and equipment speed affecting the operation time and fuel quantity. Convenient prediction models (multi-variate nonlinear) for logistics distance, operation time, and fuel quantity, using the influential field variables, produced very good fits (R2≥0.98). Overall, an ABP with a capacity of 8 BPT, split which can also handle 11 BPT, is recommended considering the logistics energy.}

Data Envelopment Analysis is applied to derive an efficiency score reflecting the degree to which sustainable operational logistics performance (SOLP) is achieved within each sample nation. A comparison between the national rankings achieved under the LPI and SOLP evaluation regimes reveal that there is a statistically insignificant monotonic correlation between them. While one country may be a top performer with respect to one of the evaluation approaches, it does not emerge as such under the other. However, the results of the analysis suggest that logistics industries of the United States, the Netherlands, Norway and Australia are found to be top performers under both approaches, while that of Greece, Korea, Italy and Portugal are found to be poor performers under both. The paper concludes that the SOLP approach provides useful information that supplements that provided by the LPI, but that it better facilitates performance improvements within a nation's logistics industry by helping to identify the sources of inefficiency and the nations which possess benchmark performing logistics sectors.}

abstract = {The growth in e-commerce has led to increased pressure within the courier, express and parcel (CEP) sector to tackle the ‘last-mile’ issue and come up with solutions that not only satisfy the customers, but also other stakeholders such as city councils and other regulatory bodies. Scholars have highlighted micro-hubs and the associated horizontal collaboration as a possible solution, which might help alleviate problems associated with last-mile logistics in inner-city centers. However, trust and data exchange issues are considerable barriers to the introduction of horizontal collaboration, in particular between CEP carriers. To address the lack of trust and the issue of data exchange between carriers, the use of blockchain technology may present a solution, but existing research so far is limited concerning frameworks that specifically discuss blockchain technology in the context of micro-hubs and last-mile deliveries. In response, this paper presents a blockchain decision framework for a horizontal collaboration between CEP carriers based on key characteristics of existing blockchain decision models and relevant related research in the area of logistics and last-mile distribution. This is the first study that specifically addresses the use of blockchain technology for horizontal collaboration in the context of micro-hubs and last-mile deliveries.}

abstract = {E-commerce retail sales have seen significant growth in the past decade with its proliferation into the consumer markets at unprecedented rates. This has led to the rise of logistics companies (LC) and the advent of Logistics financing as a tool used by them to attain business expansion. The current climate in e-commerce that is characterized by an upswing in sales requires the LCs to equip themselves with sufficient capital to elevate or modernize their operational capabilities. But, these small and medium-sized enterprises tend to overlook their business expansion opportunities due to the unfavorable financing environment created due to their: (i) limited tangible assets (ii) lack of clarity on operating capability, and (iii) lack of reliable information-sharing mechanism. To address these problems, this study aims to utilize the digital assets of the LC to aid logistics financing. This study introduces a logistics financing platform (Log-Flock), that leverages the abilities of the Internet of Things (IoT), cyber-physical system (CPS), and blockchain technologies to support the utilization of digital assets of the LC for logistics financing. The IoT and CPS are combined to support the generation of the digital assets whereas the core constructs of blockchain technology, such as the tokens and smart contracts, are used to (i) introduce incentivized rewarding mechanisms to motivate the engagement of users and, (ii) to perform the digital asset valuation and risk assessment in logistics financing. Some of the expected benefits from the study include: (i) This novel platform if implemented, would significantly reduce the time for financing. (ii) It communicates the operating capability of the LCs in the form of credit rating which is easily comprehensible for the financing institutions.}

The aim of this paper is to identify the determinants of logistics performance and investigate its empirical linkages with economic and environmental indicators. We built a macro-level dataset for the top 25 ranked logistics countries from 2007 to 2018, conducting a set of panel data tests on cross-sectional dependence, stationarity and cointegration, to provide preliminary insights. Empirical estimates from Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares (FMOLS), Generalized Method of Moments (GMM), and Quantile Regression (QR) model suggest that technological innovation, Human Development Index (HDI), urbanization, and trade openness significantly boost logistic performance, whereas employment and Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) fail to respond in such a desirable path. In turn, an increase in the Logistic Performance Index (LPI) is found to worsen economic growth. Finally, LPI exhibits a large positive effect on carbon emissions, which is congruent with a strand of the literature highlighting that the modern supply chain is far from being decarbonized. Thus, this evidence further suggest that more global efforts should be geared to attain a sustainable logistics.}

Accordingly, it derives recommendations that could increase the actors’ inter- and- intra-organisational alignment on green targets throughout these phases. Empirical data are obtained from eight individual cases of three shippers and five LSPs, representing the buyer/seller roles within logistics arrangements. Contrary to previous literature holding the view that setting more green demands by shippers would guarantee green outcomes, the findings show that shippers’ green demands may hinder green logistics applications due to impediments to LSPs’ asset-sharing strategies. Also, a deadlock situation is revealed in the negotiations phase, where both actors await each other to introduce additional demands/offers—calling for further regulatory intervention to release this deadlock. Moreover, this paper shows how a mismatch of interests in contractual periods between shippers and LSPs can obstruct green investments—signalling that the green criterion is not the decisive factor in shaping shippers’ outsourcing strategies. The findings also stress a lack of follow-up efforts by shippers on green measures that were specified pre-contract, attributing this to contrasting intra-organisational objectives within shippers’ firms. This paper contributes to the green logistics purchasing literature by revealing how different contractual settings play an important role in shaping shippers’/LSPs’ perceptions of green concerns during the logistics purchasing process. Further, it is one of the first studies to provide phase-specific recommendations to increase the actors’ alignment on green targets.}

However, there are few studies on the consideration of carbon emission factors in logistics performance evaluation. To this end, this study developed a comprehensive evaluation index system to assess the performance of China’s logistics. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce the indicator dimensions and then a Slacks-Based Measure-Data Envelopment Analysis (SBM-DEA) was employed to measure and evaluate the logistics performance with and without carbon emissions constraints of 30 provinces/municipalities in China and analyze the overall level and spatial characteristics of China’s logistics industry efficiency. Regression analyses using the Tobit model were then conducted to identify the driving factors. The results show that: (1) There are large regional differences in China’s logistics efficiency, showing a gradual decline from east to west regions; (2) Low scale efficiency is an important factor restricting the logistics development; (3) In terms of influencing factors, regional economic and logistics development are positively related to the logistics efficiency, and energy structure and government influence are negatively related to the logistics efficiency.}

Many areas in the eastern part of Indonesia have a flawed logistics system that results in a low level of competitiveness. The paper analyses local ports’ performance and maritime logistics impact on the small island economy in East Indonesia, especially in the North Maluku Province. The research method used the survey and the Stochastic Frontier Analysis to measure each local port's performance in which Gross Regional Domestic Product (GRDP) per capita constitutes the output variable. While GRDP, number of cargo throughput, number of port labor, inland connection, loading and unloading tariff, and sea freight cost are input variables. The results show that the loading and unloading tariffs and sea transportation costs harm the GRDP per capita of the respective small island districts. Other findings suggest that the port of Morotai, Central Halmahera, North Halmahera, and Ternate have a higher level of technical efficiency than those in East Halmahera, South Halmahera, Sula, and Tidore. Low port efficiency can disrupt the distribution of goods between islands, resulting in higher logistics costs. The limited data and the small scope of the area is the restriction of the study.}

Nevertheless, few studies relate to IRL design, with most existing research focusing on economic efficiency. However, IRL networks’ resilience is equally or even more important than the typical logistics network design. As developed countries—including Japan—are usually exporters of recyclables, IRL malfunctions can cause waste or recyclables to accumulate in these countries, leading to inefficient waste management practices, such as landfilling. As IRL networks are characterized by low transportation rates and other uncertainties, they must be able to absorb this volatility and function despite any disruptions. This study utilizes a Japanese case study of IRL networks to establish a model and design a resilient, efficient IRL network using a cost-minimization model with resilience constraints. Our model reveals that expanding ports in a remote area with inexpensive storage costs increases economies of scale while contributing to IRL networks’ resilience by forming hubs.}

This paper introduces the mixed fleet based green clustered logistics problem (MFGCLP) under CO2 emission cap to deal with the sustainable development effort of the transportation industry. The mixed fleet consists of hydrogen vehicles and conventional vehicles. In the proposed distribution problem, customers are clustered in different segments based on similar characteristics. The customers belonging to a cluster must be served by the same vehicle before it visits customers from a different cluster or before it returns to the depot. The CO2 emission of the vehicles is realistically considered as a function of traveled distance, speed, and on-board cargo load. The problem also includes time windows for customers and maximum tour length for the routes. A new hybrid metaheuristic, combining particle swarm optimization (PSO) and neighborhood search, is proposed to solve the problem. Extensive computational experiments have been performed on newly generated problem instances, and benchmark problem instances adopted from the literature. The proposed hybrid PSO proved to be superior to the state-of-the-art algorithms available in the literature.}

The paper aims to distinguish Ho.Re.Ca. specific cost generators and to provide different stakeholders with guidelines on improving the efficiency and sustainability of delivery operations. Therefore, a Ho.Re.Ca. specific costs function has been developed and calculates both internal (economic) as external (social and environmental) costs. The developed cost function follows a 3-steps approach: exploratory expert interviews and observations, the development of the cost function and, validation by the same business experts. The main findings are that mostly the characteristics of the goods determine the way Ho.Re.Ca. goods are delivered nowadays. However, the location of demand and supply for the goods and the specific handling conditions also have a significant influence. The following specific cost generators are distinguished: all labour-based activities rise the internal costs structures substantially. Congestion and city quality issues are identified as major external costs generators. Originating from these results, transport operators should focus on improving labour-based activities such as the service time by investing in e.g. innovative (un)loading equipment. For governments, the internalisation of congestion-related externalities by e.g. road pricing is decisive.}

In this paper, we consider the problem of synchronous scheduling of logistics services and processing services in cloud manufacturing. Based on the mathematical description, we present a collaborative optimization algorithm for logistics and processing services which we call COOPS to generate scheduling solutions for both processing tasks and logistics tasks at the same time. Typical optimization algorithms such as pattern search, particle swarm optimization and simulated annealing are compared with the proposed algorithm to show their performance on the average completion time of all manufacturing tasks. Results show that the proposed method obtains a shorter average completion time for all tasks in different scenarios.}

Comparative analysis was applied to investigate the similarities of and differences in the urbanization-related factors affecting the decoupling state of provinces. The main results were as follows: (1) Weak decoupling was the dominant state of logistics in China during 2007–2016. There were weak decoupling and strong decoupling in most of the observation period in the eastern region, while there was no strong decoupling in the central and western regions. (2) From the national perspective, urbanization-related factors had very significant but different impacts. Population quantity, spatial structure and spatial expansion were the key inhibitors, while population density was the main contributor. (3) From the regional perspective, the patterns of urbanization-related factors in the three regions were similar. Population density had a positive but decreasing effect on decoupling in the three regions, especially the western region. Population quantity had an increasing negative effect on decoupling in the three regions, especially the central and western regions. Spatial expansion had an increasing negative effect on decoupling in the eastern and western regions but a decreasing negative effect in the central region; and spatial structure had a stable negative effect on the three regions.

This study attempts to quantify the OFDI-induced productivity spillover effects in the context of China’s LSI by leveraging the most up-to-date data in conjunction with advanced econometric techniques. Our study reveals that the OFDI of logistics enterprises poses a distinctly positive impact on productivity growth in the logistics industry, and that this impact has been further strengthened since the launch of the Belt and Road Initiative. We also demonstrate a long-term bidirectional causality between the logistics enterprises' OFDI and the growth of productivity in the domestic LSI. It implies that enhancing global connectivity and supply chain collaborations requires an effective and efficient logistics operation and management, which in turn provides more opportunities to accrue positive productivity spillovers. The results remain robust with various datasets, specifications, and estimators. The study provides novel insights into the improvement of logistics efficiency through OFDI-facilitated technological spillovers and resource acquisition. With a better understanding of the implications and effectiveness of the Go-Global strategies, the findings can be leveraged as guidelines to assist in making informed decisions for the further development of domestic logistics, as well as for cross-border investments.}

abstract = {Although the application of blockchain technology in maritime industry can improve the customs clearance efficiency and logistics transparency in the container cargo supply chains, it generates the unit operations cost and setup cost. In this study, a spatial model is proposed to conduct an investigation into the two heterogeneous ports when blockchain technology is applied under inter-port competition. Different utility-driven operations models are built to highlight the values of blockchain technology for port logistics capability, and to reveal the equilibria under the optimal strategies and equilibrium strategies. It is noticed that the relationship between the unit net benefit and unit operations cost brought out by blockchain technology is a key factor determining whether the blockchain technology is applicable. When the unit operations cost is lower than unit net benefit, and the setup cost is high, there is a win-win situation for two ports to apply traditional technology. It is further verified to be Pareto-optimal. In addition, three lose-lose situations are also identified, which are classic Prisoner's Dilemmas. Consequently, a horizontal collaboration mechanism “blockchain technology sharing + compensation” (BTSC) is designed to not only break these three Prisoner's Dilemmas, but also achieve the Pareto-optimum. Furthermore, we discuss some extensions to prove the robustness of our main qualitative insights.}

abstract = {Hazardous materials are important raw materials for economic, social and industrial production. With the increasing demand for hazardous materials, there is an increasing demand for facilities in the production, transfer, distribution and storage of hazardous materials in China. In recent years, there are frequent conflicts for the location of hazardous materials logistics at home and abroad. The conflicts not only lead to the delay or even cancellation of these projects, but also seriously endanger the local social and public security. At present, China's economy is in a period of rapid development, the public’s awareness of environmental rights has increased, and it is extremely sensitive to the location of hazardous materials logistics. The public participation in the decision-making stage of the NIMBY project can effectively prevent the NIMBY conflict. In order to improve the situation of public participation in the decision-making stage of NIMBY projects, this paper takes three main stakeholders in the decision-making stage of projects-local government, investors of hazardous materials logistics facilities and the surrounding public as the research objects, and uses evolutionary game theory to explore the influence of different interest demands on the strategic choices of the three parties. It is of great theoretical and practical significance to resolve the risk of social conflicts.}

abstract = {In e-commerce, many online platforms operate as a reseller for some products and serve as a marketplace for others. Under both selling modes, the logistics service can be undertaken by the platform or the supplier. The combination between the selling mode and the logistics service strategy produces four typical scenarios: (a) the platform acts as a reseller and the supplier offers the logistics service, namely, the RS scenario; (b) the platform serves as a reseller and provides the logistics service, namely, the RP scenario; (c) the platform works as a marketplace and the supplier offers the logistics service, namely, the MS scenario; and (d) the platform operates as a marketplace and provides the logistics service, namely, the MP scenario. On this basis, this paper proposes an analytical model to examine how the selling mode choice interacts with the logistics service strategy. We find that the supplier's preference aligns with the improvement of the logistics service level. When the cost performance of the logistics service is high, the RP scenario will generate the highest logistics service level, in which the supplier will gain the highest profit; when the cost performance of the logistics service is low, the MS scenario will generate the highest logistics service level and give the supplier the highest profit. For the platform, as the logistics service's cost performance increases, his preferred scenario will evolve from MP to MS, and then to RP. Further, we examine the equilibrium scenario by considering the interactions between the supplier and the online platform. We find that the MS scenario will be the equilibrium when the logistics service's cost performance is in the medium range; otherwise, RP will become the equilibrium scenario.}

We consider a distributionally robust facility location model with chance constraints in which the nodes and edges of the network are vulnerable to random failure. Efficiency, effectiveness and equity metrics, which can be explicitly demonstrated as operational costs, service quality and the coverage rate, are incorporated to quantitatively measure system performance under disaster situations. As chance constraints are intractable, we correspondingly propose conic and linear approximations. The reformulated model is solved within the outer approximation framework, where three acceleration techniques, i.e., the branch-and-cut algorithm, in–out algorithm, and Benders decomposition, are embedded to increase the computational efficacy. Through extensive numerical results and a case study, our proposed model is found to be superior to traditional scenario-based approaches.}

What is often neglected is other factors that contribute to a customer’s overall experience like customisation and flexibility of deliveries, especially in cases when a customer’s needs and plans change between order placement and order delivery. This paper explores the value of a flexible type of logistics offering in which the customer is able to change the order requirements (such as delivery date) after the order has been placed. In particular, we focus on the interactions between a retailer and a customer in agreeing and executing such logistics orders. We examine the benefits of this type of flexible logistics offerings because flexibility and customisation are critical factors for the success of omni-channel commerce. Such offerings are clearly connected with recent developments in digital technologies as these technologies are essential for the implementation. Our results indicate that flexible logistics offerings can be beneficial both for retailers and for customers. They also highlight the importance of receiving orders that do not fully meet the requirements of a customer.}

A fourth-party logistics firm (4PL) deputes a third-party logistics firm (3PL) to complete the tasks received from clients. The 4PL cannot observe the effort/investment level of the 3PL on the delivery quality but only on the ex post delivery quality. Thus, a contract based on delivery quality is proposed to stimulate the 3PL to exert optimal effort/investment for the outsourced task. First, we derive the optimal contract contents both in symmetric and asymmetric information settings and show that in the asymmetric information setting, although a menu of contracts can induce the 3PL to tell the truth, asymmetric efficiency information can lead to a drop in delivery quality as well as in system-wide welfare. Then, to deal with this issue in the asymmetric information setting, we introduce two contracts: noncooperative bargaining and cooperative bargaining contracts. We find that the cooperative bargaining contract can ensure the 3PL exerts the maximum effort/investment level and achieves high-quality delivery and system-wide welfare. Finally, we extend our study to a case with discrete efficiency distribution and analyze various types of contracts as well as their implications.}

RL is imperative due to various reasons such as reducing environmental problems, cost controlling, competitive advantage, and many more. But, still, the area of RL is not saturated enough; there are various issues that researchers need to address. In this paper, we have focused our concern towards the RL parameters and organised retailers in India. Retailers are one of the significant links in RL process and hence their role is also critical. The paper helps to analyze the RL practices adopted by the organised retailers and their performance. A Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution, which is usually abbreviated as TOPSIS generally referred to as the multi-criteria decision analysis method while fuzzy TOPSIS is incorporated to choose the best practitioner of RL among all retailers. The output of the study is based on multiple case studies. Based on the results of RL parameters, the second retailer has emerged as the top while the fifth retailer is found as the lowest among all the retailers. The findings of the study provided a rank of them that aid others to improve their performances. Further, the identified RL parameters as critical inputs indicate the retailers being extra proactive and well-arranged encompassed of twenty-four retailers in three groups. The study’s emphasis on vital factors will support others to achieve higher productivity for higher sustainability in the retail sector context.}

However, these stakeholders are mostly not taken into consideration when planners and decision makers look into potential solutions to the issues generated by freight operations. In this paper, results are shown from a survey conducted and analyzed unveiling citizens’ perceptions with respect to the urban freight system in a mid-size urban area. Four hypotheses are proposed and tested using a Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) approach. Results show that, unlike what is generally believed, citizens are aware of the freight system and its impact on their daily activities. Moreover, citizens who perceive the infrastructure to be in poor condition also have a greater awareness of the negative externalities generated by freight operations. In addition, having a higher perception of freight’s negative externalities decreases citizens’ perception of the overall performance of freight logistics in the city. Furthermore, the results unveiled heterogeneity in citizens’ perceptions based on their socio-economic characteristics and based on their location. The results shed light on the perceptions citizens have towards urban freight logistics, and confirms the importance that decision makers should place on engaging the public early in the planning process. By raising awareness among planners in a proactive manner, these findings could be used to enhance the level of community engagement in freight planning, and by extension the level of citizen support for programs and initiatives aimed at addressing urban freight issues.}

In this regard, much research has been done on restoring depreciated and consumed products to the supply chain; many factors, including the quality of returned products, can significantly impact how the reverse logistics network will be used. The two-stage stochastic mixed-integer programming model proposed in this paper considers various processes of recovering recyclable products, including reuse, refurbishing, remanufacturing, recycling, and selling spare parts. Also, considering uncertainty on quality and quantity of returned products, product variety, and bill of material are model features. Due to the computational complexity of large-scale problems, such problems require considerable time to solve. To tackle this issue, a hybrid algorithm constructed by a genetic algorithm and branch and cut algorithm (with CPLEX solver) has been introduced, which can significantly reduce the solution time. Finally, the algorithm is applied to a real-world problem to design a reverse logistics network for a small-size laboratory equipment manufacturer.}

We investigate whether cost-sharing (CS) or revenue-sharing (RS) contracts can coordinate the supply chain and suggest a hybrid CS–RS contract to improve performance. We find that, compared with decentralized options, CS and RS contracts achieve a higher level of smart logistics transformation. While the coordination and effectiveness of CS contracts are superior to those of RS contracts, neither can fully coordinate the supply chain. The proposed hybrid CS–RS contract allows the manufacturer to share the LSP’s costs before the transformation and its partial revenue after transformation, so that the LSP can reduce its service charge, thereby achieving full supply chain coordination.}

A challenging task in this field is the learning behavior modeling of military logistics agents. Profit sharing (PS) reinforcement learning algorithm is a representative exploitation-oriented method describing empirical reinforcement learning mechanism, and has been successfully applied to a variety of real-world problems. However, constructing the learning behavior model of military logistics agents is difficult by merely using the original PS algorithm. This difficulty is due to the actual characteristics of equipment support operations and military requirements, such as experience sharing, cooperative action, and hierarchical control. To address this issue, we propose an improved PS algorithm by introducing cooperative task reward correction parameters, experience sharing learning function, and superior command controlled function. We use the research methodology centering on the basic process of the improved PS algorithm as basis to construct the architecture of the learning behavior model of military logistics agents and its corresponding model of elements. Furthermore, we design the implementation algorithm of the learning behavior model. Lastly, we conduct a case study of a tactical military industrial logistics simulation system, thereby verifying the feasibility and effectiveness of the learning behavior model. We find that the improved PS algorithm and corresponding learning behavior model have more advantages than the original PS algorithm.}

On the one hand, time series analysis is used to: (i) forecast the long-term cost of the logistics service; and (ii) construct a ‘risk-aware’ interval for the prices to be offered in the bid. On the other hand, historical data is used to develop statistical learning models. These models are able to predict the probability of success in a given tender based on the actual values of different variables, including the service prices established in the previous stage. Some preliminary results are given, as well as a discussion on how these methods can be integrated into optimization models.}

This paper describes a multi-stage network-based model to minimize the overall cost for the reverse logistics management of inert construction waste across its entire life cycle. This model takes a unique two-type costing approach to overcome the ambiguities and deficiencies existing in previous models. Type-I cost refers to the facility-based costing (FBC) and Type-II cost refers to non-facility based costing (NFBC). The mixed-integer linear programming technique is applied using the LINGO software. A case study of construction waste management in Hong Kong is conducted to validate the developed model, which includes waste generation point as the starting node, public fill reception facility and recycling facility as an intermediate node, and landfill as an ending node. The result shows about 24% reduction in the total cost compared to the base case. Furthermore, to evaluate the impact of uncertainties on the cost parameters, a detailed scenario based sensitivity analysis is conducted. The optimal result shows that the larger portion of total cost come from the NFBC component. Therefore, NFBC is critical in defining the overall reverse logistics network and thus, should be given more emphasis in the design of an effective construction waste management system.}

abstract = {The operational design and planning of drone-based logistics models is a rapidly growing area of scientific research. In this paper, we present a structured, comprehensive, and scalable framework for classifying drone-based delivery systems and their associated routing problems along with a comprehensive review and synthesis of the extant academic literature in this domain. While our proposed classification defines the boundaries and facilitates the comparison between a wide variety of possible drone-based logistics systems, our comprehensive literature review helps to identify and prioritize research gaps that need to be addressed by future work. Our review shows that the extant research reasonably considers some relevant real-world operational constraints. Although the multi-visit multi-drone Pure-play Drone-based (PD) delivery models are popular, the majority of the Synchronized Multi-modal (SM) delivery models focus on formulating and evaluating single-truck, single-drone models. Moreover, the Resupply Multi-modal (RM) models have not received the due attention for research compared to other drone-based delivery models. Our comprehensive review of use cases of drones for delivery indicates that most of the reviewed models are designed for applications in e-commerce and healthcare/emergency services. Other applications, such as food and mail deliveries are still underrepresented in the academic discussion.}

However, there are still many enterprises, especially smaller companies that do not use discrete-event simulation because of the high costs associated with buying and maintaining commercial simulation tools. The question is whether or not free discrete-event simulation software is an alternative to commercial tools for solving typical planning tasks in production and logistics. The paper analyzes the modeling process with the three free and open-source discrete-event simulation tools Salabim, JaamSim and CloudSim and compares them with the two standard commercial simulation packages Arena and Plant Simulation. JaamSim provides everything which is necessary to model typical planning tasks in production and logistics and proves as a real alternative to commercial discrete-event simulation tools.}

The abnormal activities monitored in real time are rectified so that the customer's electronic orders can be displayed through the support of big data, thus laying the foundation for the development of intelligent logistics. Under the data system, an exception model is created and classified and regressed. In this model, the security and stability of customer orders in the network can be automatically detected, and the abnormal data can be analyzed and evaluated. Unusual circumstances of this kind need to be in an intelligent logistics environment, and delivery tasks must be called intuitive for special care. Early detection of abnormal order events is expected to improve the accuracy of delivery planning. To enable new technical solutions, the logistics industry and economic decision-makers often lack the IT background and expertise needed to start developing new systems and technical solutions. Evaluate the benefits of using. Implementation and integration complexity is seen as one of the three major obstacles to the success of the IoT above.

While some European examples show that collection-and-delivery points (CDPs) offer a sustainable solution, this is not always the case. This paper explores the mechanisms that support CDPs as sustainable urban logistics innovations while providing viable market offerings. To do so, it analyses a failure case using multiple data sources, such as a consumer survey, interviews and secondary data. Using diffusion of innovations (DoI) theory, the study explains how CDP failed in a developing market setting. Sustainable logistics innovations fail due to both supply chain-related and market-related factors. Significant factors on the supply chain side include network structures, IT integration and diverse value propositions while the market side includes consumer market characteristics, regulations, security issues and convenience of existing alternatives. Important factors for success include looking for horizontal collaboration opportunities, building strong network partnerships with customers and distribution channel actors. CDPs should be positioned as sustainable solutions and complemented with other urban logistics services to diversify the value proposition.}

Based on the optimized cooperation scheme, the core and Shapley value are used to fairly allocate the cost savings. The numerical results show that a long-term grand coalition will be beneficial to all the participators. The proposed information-merging-and-algorithm-driven cooperative optimization model will be practicable for intelligent logistics systems.}

Methodologically, the research was supported by a case study, that applied documentary research, direct observation and semi-structured interviews with professionals with extensive experience. As main results, it was observed that the risk identification stage pointed out the “bad segregation or contamination of the waste” as the risk with the greatest potential impact on the operations, since in the event of its occurrence, it may compromise a relevant percentage of the company’s revenue with co-products from the sale of solid waste, in addition to environmental impacts through the release of a wide variety of polluting products, endangering human health and biodiversity. As a main conclusion, it is observed that the risk management process applied to the reverse logistics of steel residues has the ability to organize proactive actions so that risks are identified, analyzed and evaluated, minimizing their occurrence and promoting risk mitigation actions.}

abstract = {Toll roads constructed under public-private-partnerships (PPP) are very common around the world. Due to the high capital cost invested and high risks associated with subsequent returns, investors are concerned about future revenue. Charging high tolls from freight vehicles is a common practice, especially in urban areas. As a result, freight vehicles tend to divert from freeways (toll roads) to highways and arterial roads to minimize their costs, but this may cause more damage to infrastructure and environment, thus more costs for society and the environment. Consequently, developing an effective solution for toll charges for freight vehicles is a complex City Logistics problem involving multiple stakeholders with multi-objectives. This research investigates total costs (economic, social and environmental) associated with freight transportation based on existing toll structures for a toll road in Melbourne, Australia. Using a real case study, a step by step process was developed to illustrate the inefficiencies that exist in the present rigid toll charging mechanisms and how these inefficiencies can be corrected considering multi-stakeholder objectives and the overall impacts. This research identifies an optimal set of solutions that can be considered by decision-makers for implementation considering trade-offs between multiple management objectives. By considering subsidies, this research also identifies a good practical solution for minimizing the total cost of urban freight transportation while satisfying the investor needs. This policy decision is illustrated and related issues are discussed.}

To provide resolutions to the problems of optimizing deployment and formation of resources in wartime industrial logistics system (e.g., military logistics platforms [MLPs]), we conduct a typical application of this framework. As the research objects of the fourth layer, war statistics, mathematical calculations and simulation experiment are designed as the means by which descriptive analysis, predictive analysis and prescriptive analysis at the fifth layer can be implemented, respectively.

Traffic Internet of Things (IoT) connects ubiquitous devices and collects data from various channels like traffic cameras, vehicle detectors, GPS, sensors, etc. that can be used to analyze real-time traffic status and eventually increase the efficiency of logistics management for Logistics 4.0. However, big IoT data contain joint features that interact non-linearly and complicatedly, thus increasing the stochastic nature and difficulty of determining travel time on real-time basis. This research proposes a novel method (named the gradient boosting partitioned regression tree model) to forecast travel time based on big data collected from the industrial IoT infrastructure. The proposed method separates the global regression tree model based on the gradient boosting decision tree into several partitions to capture the time-varying features simultaneously – that is, to subdivide the non-linearity into fragments and to characterize the feature interactions in a manageable way with recursive partitions. We illustrate several analytical properties with manageable advantages in terms of big data analytics of the proposed method and apply it to real traffic IoT data. Findings of this research show that the proposed method performs successfully at enhancing the predictive accuracy of travel time after empirically comparing it with other computational methods.}

Such systems make use of their own dedicated fleets but will also use a crowdsourced delivery mode by hiring occasional fleets. These mixed logistics systems with both dedicated and occasional fleets serve both retailers’ internal delivery tasks and external tasks requested by local businesses. This paper studies the problem of scheduling heterogeneous (internal and external) delivery tasks on a mixed logistics platform with multiple depots and two types of vehicles (dedicated and occasional). A delivery task is executed by either a dedicated vehicle or an occasional vehicle. The dedicated vehicles depart from and return to the platform's depots; the occasional vehicles depart from their original location and pick up goods from depots or external pickup locations, fulfill the delivery tasks, and finish their route at the final delivery location. We propose mixed integer programming models and column generation-based solution methods to solve the problem. A computational study is conducted based on a series of randomly generated instances and real-world instances involving 15 depots, 120 internal customers, 15 external delivery tasks, and 38 dedicated and occasional vehicles. The results obtained demonstrate the efficiency of the column generation-based solution methods. Moreover, the effectiveness of the proposed models is validated by a significant cost saving in comparison to intuitive decision rules. A sensitivity analysis is also conducted to derive a number of managerial implications.}

Disasters impact continues to make headlines annually as lives and properties are lost. The humanitarian community, through their logistics operations, attends to such disasters when it occurs. Despite the assistance of humanitarian relief operations support, the relief community is faced challenges such as huge logistics costs, fewer donor supports, which affects the delivery of relief to affected people. The high cost of humanitarian logistics operations on disaster finances continue to pose a hurdle for operators as donor support is not worthwhile. The study uses a systematic literature review coupled with an axiological philosophical lens approach to developing a Humanitarian Logistics Digital Business Ecosystem (HLDBE) framework as an alternative way to sustain the humanitarian logistics operations and reliefs through hybrid humanitarian- business logistics sector. Seven elements derived from the framework are collaborative blocks for establishing a sustainable HLDBE for relief logistics operations in creating of the financial reserve, capacity and empowerment building for domestic and international humanitarian logistics operations under a win-win opportunity for stakeholders. Implementation of this ecosystem will have a positive impact on affected economies. Future research direction is also proposed to further the research direction.}
