abstract = {This paper proposes an encryption scheme based on an improved chaotic system that can hide key information. First, the CML chaotic map is improved, and the chaotic state can be entered from 0. The image of the person is divided into key information and non-key information and spread by different diffusion methods. The RSA algorithm is used to encrypt the size of the key information as part of the key to enhancing the resistance to the chosen plaintext attack. Scrambling is performed at the pixel level using a CML system with a sorting function. The experimental and security analysis results show that the new algorithm has a large key space, is sensitive to keys and plaintext images, has a good encryption effect, and can resist common attack methods.}

abstract = {The rising competition in the logistics sector forces companies to be more economically efficient. One of the major sources of inefficiency is the incomplete usage of available resources, such as vehicles’ capacities. Mechanism that allow to better exploit such resources by enabling carrier collaborations are on the rise. Our study examines a centrally organized multi-period collaborative vehicle routing problem, where carriers can exchange customers who have to be serviced on a regular basis. Collaborations, where carriers serve frequent customers, are supposed to face the problem of (i) time consistency in terms of visiting time, and of (ii) service consistency. The latter ensures that customers are visited by the same collaboration partner throughout the whole planning horizon. Additionally, carriers might only be willing to enter a collaboration if a minimum market share can be guaranteed. In order to take all these issues into account, we introduce the collaborative vehicle routing problem with time and service consistency and workload balance. The mathematical model including several valid inequalities is presented. In a computational study, we solve small-sized instances to optimality. In order to tackle larger instances, we propose an efficient and effective matheuristic and an iterated local search algorithm. We show that both methods reach near optimal solutions within very short computational times. Managerial insights on the cost of imposing time and service consistency as well as workload balancing constraints are presented and discussed. We show that, according to our computational study, consistency constraints can be imposed for almost no additional cost, while workload balancing constraints do not have any negative effect on the total collaboration profit. This is a meaningful insight and might be a strong argument for carriers to enter collaborations.}

Existing winner determination models tend to ignore bidders’ disruption risks and its dire consequences. This paper particularly studies a revised winner determination problem with disruption risks of bidders for a fourth party logistics (4PL) provider to purchase transportation services via combinatorial reverse auctions. Integrating a hybrid mitigation strategy that includes fortification, reservation and outside option policies to deal with disruptions, a new two-stage stochastic winner determination model is constructed. Based on the characteristics of the deterministic equivalent reformulation, a scenario-based approximation approach is developed as solution method. An upper bound can be obtained by using a scenario reduction approach, and a lower bound can be derived by employing a problem-based relaxation method or an efficient dual decomposition Lagrangian relaxation approach. Numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed model and method, since the gap between the upper bound and lower bound is small. Comparison analysis indicates that our strategy is better than some known strategies, and would have a more significant influence on cost minimization of the 4PL as the probability of disruption becomes higher. Managerial implications are drawn for 4PLs to provide high quality of transportation services under disruptions.}

To support the use of renewable fuels, this study identifies early adopters in commercial transportation. We also examine requirements for user acceptance. Finally, we present policy recommendations to increase user acceptance of these fuels. To answer these research questions, we utilize three group discussions with commercial fleet operators of companies operating in urban areas as well as national and international transportation. By discussing on acceptance-building measures, barriers as well as their perception of branches comparatively most appropriate to renewable fuels’ characteristics. The empirical results show that long-distance trucking is the most likely early adopter of renewable fuels. Within long-distance trucking, large logistics and transportation firms in particular are identified as most suitable. Small and medium sized firms, however, are not seen as early adopters. This is due the numerous technical options they have (e.g., renewable fuels, electric vehicles), price uncertainty of renewable fuels, and volatile political decisions regarding vehicles. In our analysis we further identify three acceptance objects: aspects of practical use of renewable fuels (e.g., vehicle technology readiness levels and knowledge), secondary effects of renewable fuel production (e.g., upstream environmental burdens), and the relationship of renewable fuels to electric vehicles. Finally, we provide policy recommendations to support of renewable fuels. First, potential users require reliable and detailed information about planned government actions. In addition, there is a need for long-term funding for these new technologies. In particular, use-case specific (e.g., long-distance trucking) funding is important. Finally, consideration of and information about secondary effects (e.g., upstream environmental burdens) are crucial for user acceptance.}

This variant is faced by logistics companies that deliver products to retailers located in congested urban areas, where service times are relatively long compared to travel times, and depend on the number of deliverymen assigned to each route. Differently from traditional variants, these service times show high variability, requiring an appropriate way of handling the related uncertainty. We extend two mathematical formulations to represent the VRPTWMD under uncertainty, using the robust optimization paradigm with budgeted uncertainty sets, and developed effective exact solution methods for solving each of them. The first formulation is a robust vehicle flow model solved by a tailored branch-and-cut algorithm that resorts to 1- and 2-path inequalities that we show how to effectively separate. The second formulation is a set partitioning model, for which we propose a branch-price-and-cut algorithm that relies on a robust resource-constrained elementary shortest path problem. The results of computational experiments using instances from the literature and risk analysis via a Monte Carlo simulation show the importance of incorporating uncertainties in the VRPTWMD, and indicate the sensitivity of decisions as well as cost and risk to the level of uncertainty in the input data.}

The development of biomass industry, therefore, appears to be one priority area and is an important step to motivate the global circular economy and sustainability. However, due to the existence of commercialisation barriers, the biomass industry in developing country, such as Malaysia, is not on par with the increment of the country's gross domestic product. This paper overviews the barriers of development and challenges encountered by the biomass industry in Malaysia. Challenges are classified into four barrier categories, i.e., (i) technical barrier, (ii) financial barrier, (iii) social awareness barrier and (iv) misunderstanding and gaps between stakeholders. Based on the barriers identified, recommendations which embrace the areas of technology innovation, logistics management, interaction between academia and industry, policy and enforcement, social impact and international benchmarking, are proposed. These recommendations can act as good references for the development of biomass industry in Malaysia and reflection for other developing countries with biomass resources in the promotion of sustainability and commercialisation of biomass products. The role of the five key stakeholders in commercialising the biomass technologies are highlighted in this review.}

Strategic decisions comprise opening new food banks and selecting their storage and transport capacities from a set of discrete sizes over a multi-period planning horizon. In addition, existing food banks may be closed or have their capacities expanded. Logistics decisions involve the number of charitable agencies to be supplied, their allocation to food banks, and the flow of food products across the network. We propose a mixed-integer linear programming model that accounts for all dimensions of sustainability – economic, environmental and social – through three objective functions. A computational study is conducted for problem instances capturing the characteristics of the current network operated by the Portuguese Federation of Food Banks (FPBA) in the south of Portugal. To investigate the trade-offs that occur under the three conflicting objectives, a subset of non-dominated solutions is identified through lexicographic ordering. Our study reveals that the largest trade-offs occur between the economic and the other two objectives, and that attributing the highest priority to the environmental objective results in the most balanced solutions. Moreover, multiobjective strategies that can improve the sustainability performance of the FPBA are identified. In particular, we have concluded that there is margin for improving the current performance, especially if the social dimension continues to be favoured by the FPBA.}

The authors are the winners of second and third places, combined with members of the challenge organizing committee. The problem central to the challenge was a rich VRP: expensive and, therefore, scarce equipment was to be redistributed over customer locations within time windows. The difficulty was in creating combinations of pickups and deliveries that reduce the amount of equipment needed to execute the schedule, as well as the lengths of the routes and the number of vehicles used. This paper gives a description of the solution methods of the above-mentioned participants. The second place method involves sequences of 22 low level heuristics: each of these heuristics is associated with a transition probability to move to another low level heuristic. A randomly drawn sequence of these heuristics is applied to an initial solution, after which the probabilities are updated depending on whether or not this sequence improved the objective value, hence increasing the chance of selecting the sequences that generate improved solutions. The third place method decomposes the problem into two independent parts: first, it schedules the delivery days for all requests using a genetic algorithm. Each schedule in the genetic algorithm is evaluated by estimating its cost using a deterministic routing algorithm that constructs feasible routes for each day. After spending 80 percent of time in this phase, the last 20 percent of the computation time is spent on Variable Neighborhood Descent to further improve the routes found by the deterministic routing algorithm. This article finishes with an in-depth comparison of the results of the two approaches.}

Its future relevance for solving hard optimization problems in many fields, including finance, logistics, production and design, is leveraged through the increasing availability of powerful computing capabilities. Acknowledging the existence of several literature reviews on parallel optimization, we did not find reviews that cover the most recent literature on the parallelization of both exact and (meta)heuristic methods. However, in the past decade substantial advancements in parallel computing capabilities have been achieved and used by OR scholars so that an overview of modern parallel optimization in OR that accounts for these advancements is beneficial. Another issue from previous reviews results from their adoption of different foci so that concepts used to describe and structure prior literature differ. This heterogeneity is accompanied by a lack of unifying frameworks for parallel optimization across methodologies, application fields and problems, and it has finally led to an overall fragmented picture of what has been achieved and still needs to be done in parallel optimization in OR. This review addresses the aforementioned issues with three contributions: First, we suggest a new integrative framework of parallel computational optimization across optimization problems, algorithms and application domains. The framework integrates the perspectives of algorithmic design and computational implementation of parallel optimization. Second, we apply the framework to synthesize prior research on parallel optimization in OR, focusing on computational studies published in the period 2008–2017. Finally, we suggest research directions for parallel optimization in OR.}

In order to arrive at a systematic, uniform and international approach for CT based definition and contouring of target structures, GEC ESTRO, IBS and ABS agreed to jointly develop such recommendations based on the concepts and terms as published in the ICRU Report 89. The minimum requirements are clinical examination & documentation, CT or MR imaging at diagnosis and at a minimum, CT imaging with the applicator in place. The recommendations are based on (i) assessment of the GTV at diagnosis and at brachytherapy, (ii) categorizing the response to external radiation into different clinical remission patterns, (iii) defining various clinico-radiological environments and (iv) definition & delineation of a target on CT imaging at the time of brachytherapy with the applicator in situ. CT based target contouring recommendations based on 4 remission categories within 8 defined environments, aim at improving the contouring accuracy for IGABT using CT, US and MRI as available. For each clinico-radiological environment, there is an attempt to minimize the specific uncertainties in order to arrive at the best possible contouring accuracy. Evaluating feasibility & reproducibility, to achieve a benchmark towards a gold standard MR IGABT and further clinical research including outcomes with CT Based IGABT will become the next steps.}

Particularly, the collection and disposal of unwanted medications (UMs) in households have been an increasingly important research topic. However, there is little work on building an effective reverse logistics (RL) system for collecting UMs. For stimulating more collections of UMs, an RL system with a points-exchange incentive scheme and advertising is proposed in this study. Based on Game Theory, this research takes the lead in investigating the effects of these two strategies in a two-echelon supply chain composed of a pharmaceutical manufacturer and a retailer. For the game theoretic analysis, four games are established: non-cooperative, retailer as the Stackelberg leader, manufacturer as the Stackelberg leader, and centralized games. There are three situations in each game, namely, the advertising-effective region, exchange-effective region, and joint-effective region. The optimal strategies of advertising and points-exchange proportion for both members are identified. In both joint-effective and exchange-effective regions, a preferable decentralized supply chain structure is the Nash policy, whereas it does not matter who leads the game in the advertising-effective region. Cooperation is crucial in the model, which results in a larger collection and more profit of the total supply chain. Finally, this study provides managerial implications and some suggestions for future research.}

The activists engaged in networking to create confluences of international space, plotted logistics and maps to make practical and symbolic meanings out of the regions of the bases and tests, and through nonviolent direct action attempted to perform these as an alternative geopolitics to those of the Cold War and colonialism. Together, these processes are interpreted as part of a constructivist, spatial politics, where activists sought to shape and reshape international geographies by intervening in the relationship between space, war and peace. The more they progressed, the more the campaigns seemed to embody a separate set of socio-spatial relations by which German and Ghanaian geopolitics could be challenged and navigated. The article thus sheds light on campaign mobilisation as geography and views the spatial politics of nonviolence as a powerful paradigm in the contemporary history of international activism.}

Researchers suggest that planting perennial grasses on marginal parts of agricultural fields can provide sustainability benefits; however, planting the marginal areas may result in complex shapes and changes to field areas and thus be difficult to harvest. Harvesting costs can be a limiting factor in widely adopting perennial grasses, so the more efficient the machinery operations are, the more viable perennial crops become for farmers and bioenergy stakeholders. This study explores the relationship between field shape and size and empirically derived harvesting efficiency to support assumptions relative to predicting harvesting cost, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, labor demands, and other factors impacting willingness to cultivate energy crops, which can be impacted by field efficiency. Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) mowing data were used in the study. The regression analysis showed that the natural log transformation of the perimeter-to-area (P/A) ratio was the most accurate predictor for field efficiency (FE) (R2 = 71%) among shape descriptors as it takes both field size and shape into account. Optimizing field designs that combine annual crops and perennial grasses for lower P/A ratios will decrease operation costs and, thus, improve the rate of practice adoption of perennial grasses in agriculture.}

An online survey was sent to all 43 Dutch lung surgical centers in December 2017, addressing topics in the 4 phases of perioperative care (preoperative, admission, perioperative, postoperative). Respondents were requested to report care that would be delivered to a standardized patient without perioperative complications. To compare current care with ERAS/ESTS guidelines, we assigned an ERAS/ESTS score per hospital, weighted for evidence level per recommendation. Higher scores indicate higher application of recommendations. Response rate of centers was 100%, median response rate per question was 98% (interquartile range 94–100). Some perioperative recommendations are commonly applied (>85%), such as minimally invasive surgery and regional anesthesia; others, such as admission carbohydrate drinks, are not (<35%). Wide variation was observed regarding patient counselling, pre- and postoperative admission logistics, anemia correction, fluid management, pain management, and chest drain management. Median 62% (interquartile range 53%–72%) of the maximum ERAS/ESTS score was achieved. Large variation in ERAS/ESTS score between hospitals were found in all phases (preoperative: 6.0 [6.5–10.5] points, admission: 5.0 [1.0–6.0] points, perioperative: 21.5.0 [16.0–22.5] points, postoperative: 8.0 [5.0–8.5] points). Large variation exists in perioperative care after anatomical lung resection in the Netherlands. Given previously published data linking variation in perioperative care to variation in outcomes, standardization of perioperative care in lung surgery, preferably based on the ERAS/ESTS guidelines, may be warranted but requires further study.}

Working solely on customized production or mass production is not a desirable strategy for many manufacturers anymore. The rapid advances in technology, applications, and customers’ requirements are increasing the competitiveness and, therefore, productivity. Given this new scenario, the integration between production and delivery with parallel batching machines comes as an essential issue in logistics. Efficient integrated production and delivery operation is a critical factor for minimizing costs and increasing customer satisfaction. The particular case discussed in this paper consists of scheduling jobs of generic sizes and processing times on identical and parallel batching machines, aiming to maximize profits. The objective is to get a joint production and delivery schedule that maximizes total profits, focusing on attending consumers on time. We propose a mathematical formulation and show that the addition of a set of constraints improves the commercial solver performance. Additionally, we focus on the development and analys is of two fast polynomial methods. The first, RKP, aims to obtain relaxed solutions, while the last, CMFFDA, aims to obtain feasible solutions. Furthermore, computational experiments and sensitivity analysis with random instances of different sizes are conducted to evaluate the proposed methods and the integrated system. The results show tight gaps for the mathematical formulation and algorithms RKP and CMFFDA. The proposed algorithms present short computational times for small, moderate, and large size instances, an essential quality for daily operation.}

abstract = {In the years 2013-2014, when the financial crisis that began in 2007 became ruinous for a large number of small companies, the governments of several European countries launched plans to help supersite enterprises. The types of aid have all been oriented towards promoting the innovation of production and logistics processes and have assumed quite similar characteristics in different countries. For this, it’s usual to talk about Industry 4.0 plans in each one of the 15 European countries in which these measures to help companies have been financed. The common goal of these programs is to innovate SMEs in terms of automation (of machines), integration (of lines) and interconnection (of the production system with its management). For SMEs it would be a great opportunity. However, their managers - who usually are at the same time, owners, operations managers and technicians) face great difficulties in accessing funding from an Industry 4.0" plan, due to lack of information and limits on their knowledge of new digitization technologies. To help managers / technicians to analyze the critical issues of their own company and prepare a request for technical and financial support from Industry 4.0, Politecnico di Torino and Gruppo Banca di Asti created the PMInnova Program, offering advice for check-ups, project development and participation in regional and European calls. This contribution will introduce the problem of supporting SMEs in the context of Industry 4.0, in the context of Industry 4.0, by evaluating costs and benefits which could be obtained, by answering the following questions: 1. Which are the measures of Industry 4.0 that favor the integration and the digitization in a SME? 2. How could an Industry 4.0 measure be applied to an SME with expected strong impact?}

We present here an IoT system designed to optimize, manage and monitor container transport operations along an intermodal corridor, combining rail scheduling and inland vessel navigation. The system has a modular design, enabling the interaction with external systems, independently of their nature, through the cloud-based FIWARE platform. We provide a description of the three inter-related subsystems (container tracking, rail management and inland navigation), and a description of the expected supply chain benefits derived from the implementation of the system, both in terms of shippers and of terminal integration in the logistics flow.

abstract = {Over the last decades, a great body of evidence has defined a novel view of the cellular mechanism of action of the steroid hormone 17β-estradiol (E2) through its estrogen receptors (i.e., ERα and ERβ). It is now clear that the E2-activated ERs work both as transcription factors and extra-nuclear plasma membrane-localized receptors. The activation of a plethora of signal transduction cascades follows the E2-dependent engagement of plasma membrane-localized ERs and is required for the coordination of gene expression, which ultimately controls the occurrence of the pleiotropic effects of E2. The definition of the molecular mechanisms by which the ERs locate at the cell surface (i.e., palmitoylation and protein association) determined the quest for understanding the specificity of the extra-nuclear E2 signaling. The use of mice models lacking the plasma membrane ERα localization unveiled that the extra-nuclear E2 signaling is operational in vivo but tissue-specific. However, the underlying molecular details for such ERs signaling diversity in the perspective of the E2 physiological functions in the different cellular contexts are still not understood. Therefore, to gain insights into the tissue specificity of the extra-nuclear E2 signaling to physiological functions, here we reviewed the known ERs extra-nuclear interactors and tried to extrapolate from available databases the ERα and ERβ extra-nuclear interactomes. Based on literature data, it is possible to conclude that by specifically binding to extra-nuclear localized proteins in different sub-cellular compartments, the ERs fine-tune their molecular activities. Moreover, we report that the context-dependent diversity of the ERs-mediated extra-nuclear E2 actions can be ascribed to the great flexibility of the physical structures of ERs and the spatial-temporal organization of the logistics of the cells (i.e., the endocytic compartments). Finally, we provide lists of proteins belonging to the potential ERα and ERβ extra-nuclear interactomes and propose that the systematic experimental definition of the ERs extra-nuclear interactomes in different tissues represents the next step for the research in the ERs field. Such characterization will be fundamental for the identification of novel druggable targets for the innovative treatment of ERs-related diseases.}

Earlier studies tended to demonstrate a single variable, such as the role of R & D of low-carbon technologies in improving the output of regional low-carbon innovation systems, ignoring the impacts that interactions among variables may have on systems. Different from the existing literature, we rigorously identify multiple state variables that make up a regional low-carbon innovation system and establish a Logistics equation that describes the relationships among variables. Large quantities of data and simulations are used to make the order parameters, the nonlinear forms and evolution principles of different variables explicit. Our research confirms the impact of changes in government support on regional low-carbon innovation systems, clarifies the evolutionary trends of different state variables and their correlation with each other, and identifies the shortcomings in the evolution of regional low-carbon innovation systems. The results of this study provide the basis for managers to make more targeted policies to promote the evolution of regional low-carbon innovation systems. And the proposed interdisciplinary research framework is also applicable to other fields such as strategic alliances and complex networks.}

To determine how transformative learning and risk-mitigation actions shape community resilience to climate-induced disasters, we carried out a mixed-method empirical investigation on the southern coast of Bangladesh. We found that the relationship between transformative learning and resilience-building is complex, involving multiple social cultural-structural factors (e.g., beliefs, values, power structures), practical considerations (e.g., impact on livelihood, evacuation and relocation logistics), and cognitive factors. From our observations, we draw four general conclusions: i) local culture can constrain people's framing of risk and capacity for critical reflection, resulting in a deliberate denial and amnesia of past traumatic experiences; ii) learning alone cannot enhance resilience unless it is translated into action; iii) dependence on experiential learning can lead to the assumption that the severity of past disasters will not be surpassed, generating a false sense of security; and iv) the cultivation of forward-thinking attitudes coupled with innovative strategies, such as social networking, can successfully enhance resilience to climate-related disasters. Future policymaking aimed at building community resilience to climate shocks should therefore take into account cultural and individual cognitive barriers to transformative learning and attempt to remove structural barriers to translating learning into practical action.}

On May 2, 2014, the President of the Russian Federation issued Decree No. 296 "On the Land Areas in the Arctic Zone of the Russian Federation"; the said areas include: Murmansk Region, Nenets Autonomous Area, Chukotka Autonomous Area, Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Area, and the Vorkuta Municipal District (Komi Republic). Furthermore, the land areas in the Arctic zone include the Norilsk Municipal District, a number of territories in Arkhangelsk Region (including the Arkhangelsk Municipality), various territories and islands in the Arctic Ocean, and a few uluses in Yakutia. If the plans in this field are to be completed successfully, a broad range of issues (including those relevant to information and analytics) needs to be taken into consideration. As part of resolving these issues, we believe that it is very important to make a comparative assessment of the actual economic development level in those constituent entities of the Russian Federation that are included in the Arctic zone, as well as their individual industries, specifically the transport industry, which is a vital factor in socio-economic development. This article is dedicated to a comparative analysis of the economic development status and dynamics in two constituent entities from different Federal Districts within the Arctic zone: Murmansk Region and Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Area (located in the Northwestern and Ural Federal Districts, respectively). In addition, we take a look at the Northern Sea Route and cite the newest sources of statistical data, which will help provide a more accurate factual assessment of the transportation and logistics complex operation in the Arctic zone, thus informing the identification of most topical development areas and administrative decision-making directions.}

In transportation and other logistics applications there may be significant uncertainty with respect to the exact quantities of different variants of products (or item types) that may need to be shipped at the time when the containers and packaging are procured. In the current paper we model the problem as a robust two-stage two-item type bin packing problem. In the first stage bins of different types are acquired (e.g., reefer containers and dry containers). In the second stage the items are packed into bins. The bins that are secured in the first phase must allow for all of the items to be packed in the “worst-case” demand scenario. We first develop an algorithm for the robust two-stage two-item type bin packing problem with general item-number uncertainty sets and certain box uncertainty sets for item sizes (or equivalently two item sizes). We then consider the special case of identical (or unit) item sizes. In this special case we develop closed-form solutions for the optimal solution. Our closed-form solution reveals that it is optimal to use a number of multipurpose bins that is linear in the number of items. This is in contrast with solutions of the online and offline deterministic version of our problem that use at most one multipurpose bin. Finally, we consider computational methods that are efficient in practice for a generalization with unit item sizes but with an arbitrary number of item and bin types and arbitrary compatibility structures.}

abstract = {Background
The impact of coronary artery chronic total occlusion (CTO) and its management with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in the setting of myocardial infarction (MI) related cardiogenic shock (CS) remains unclear.
Methods
This is a pre-specified analysis from the culprit-lesion-only PCI vs multivessel PCI in CS (CULPRIT-SHOCK) trial which randomized patients presenting with MI and multivessel disease complicated by CS to a culprit-lesion-only or immediate multivessel PCI strategy. CTO was defined by central core-laboratory evaluation. The independent associations between the presence of CTO and adverse outcomes at 30 days and 1 year were assessed using multivariate logistics models.
Results
A noninfarct related CTO was present in 157 of 667 (23.5%) analyzed patients. Patients presenting with CTO had more frequent diabetes mellitus or prior PCI but less frequently presented with ST segment elevation MI as index event. The presence of CTO was associated with higher rate of death at 30 days (adjusted Odds ratio 1.63; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-2.60). Rate of death at 1 year was also increased but did not reach statistical significance (adjusted Odds ratio 1.62; 95%CI 0.99-2.66). Compare to immediate multivessel PCI, a strategy of culprit-lesion-only PCI was associated with lower rates of death or renal replacement therapy at 30 days in patients with and without CTO (Odds ratio 0.79 95%CI 0.42-1.49 and Odds ratio 0.67 95%CI 0.48-0.96, respectively), without significant interaction (P = .68).
Conclusions
In patients with MI-related CS and multivessel disease, the presence of CTO is associated with adverse outcomes while a strategy of culprit-lesion-only PCI seems beneficial regardless of the presence of CTO.}

The findings show that several challenges currently impede the implementation of collection, including unsmooth collection channels, poor convenience, and low environmental awareness of residents. A new joint collection mode is put forward to increase the waste mobile phone collection rate. In the mode, the responsibilities of each stakeholder (including the collecting enterprise, the third-party logistics company, the government, and the resident) are clarified. Moreover, a conjoint analysis method is applied to identify residents' willingness for collection. The obtained results show that compensation mode, collection price, and convenience degree are the three factors that influence the prevailing preferences of residents. Collection services with high market share must satisfy the concourse of three conditions. The collection price exceeds 30% of the mobile phone's original price, the compensation mode is cash and information service is provided. These results can provide a reference for the service design of collection mode and the formulation of relevant corporate strategies.}

However, in the logistics domain, many problems can be formulated in terms of packet routing, e.g. in automated traffic routing or material handling systems. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for packet routing in such heterogeneous environments. Our approach is based on deep reinforcement learning networks combined with link-state protocol and preliminary supervised learning. Similarly to most routing algorithms, the proposed algorithm is a distributed one and is designed to run on a network constructed from interconnected routers. Unlike most other algorithms, proposed one views routers as learning agents, representing the routing problem as a multi-agent reinforcement learning problem. Modeling each router as a deep neural network allows each router to account for heterogeneous data about its environment, allowing for optimization of more complex cost functions, like in case of simultaneous optimization of bag delivery time and energy consumption in a baggage handling system. We tested the algorithm using manually constructed simulation models of computer network and baggage handling system. It outperforms state-of-the-art routing algorithms.}

The objectives of this problem include minimizing the system's total cost (including transportation, hub establishment, adjustment of the storage compartments' temperatures, and carbon emission costs) and maximizing the quality of the delivered product to the customer via the proposed model. Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) in the GAMS software was employed to formulate this problem. Then, the ε-Constraint method was adopted to solve the presented bi-objective model to obtain the Pareto frontier and consequently, a numerical example based on the CAB (Civil Aeronautics Board) database is presented to validate the applicability of the model. The solutions of the model provide information regarding the hub location (HL), allocating customers to the hubs, allocating customers to the vehicles, and the sequence of vehicles' services for the Multi Item-Multi Temperature Joint Distribution of perishable products in CSCs. Moreover, the final results revealed the existence of a contradictory exchange between the two objectives of this paper, implying that the higher is the quality of the delivered perishable product to the customer, the greater is the system's total cost. The novelty of the proposed model compared to other hub location problems (HLPs) lies in the integration of the tactical/operational decisions with strategic decisions to provide logistic solutions in CSCs by considering the carbon emissions as an environmental factor in the transportation systems for the simultaneous distribution of dissimilar storage temperatures perishable products within a CSC. The proposed model in this research can help the distributers of perishable products by maintaining the quality of the delivered items and reducing the system's total costs and considering the carbon emissions of transportation systems. This study has practical implications for the logistics and CSCs managers to not only establish a distribution network for multiple perishable products on the basis of the findings, but also respond to the environmental sustainability.}

They are particularly useful for tasks that are dull, hazardous, or dirty. Whether the use of drone delivery is beneficial to the environment and cost saving is still a topic under debate. Ideally, drones yield lower energy consumption and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, thus reducing the carbon footprint and enhancing environmental sustainability. In this research, we analytically study the impact of UAVs on CO2 emission and cost. We propose a mixed-integer (0–1 linear) green routing model for UAV to exploit the sustainability aspects of the use of UAVs for last-mile parcel deliveries. A genetic algorithm is developed to efficiently solve the complex model, and an extensive experiment is conducted to illustrate and validate the analytical model and the solution algorithm. We find that optimally routing and delivering packages with UAVs would save energy and reduce carbon emissions. The computational results strongly support the notion that using UAVs for last-mile logistics is not only cost effective, but also environmentally friendly.}

A novel heat integration strategy is proposed for the TWP production process to avoid the use of N2 and achieve auto-thermal operation. In comparison with CWPs, producing TWPs in the operating sequence drying, torrefaction, grinding, pelletization can reduce production costs by about 10% and reduce delivered costs to both domestic and overseas markets by about 20%. It is essential that the TWP plant is located in a region with abundant and low-cost feedstock, low electricity price, low labor cost, and efficient distribution logistics. Due to the low capital cost contribution (10%), torrefaction could be implemented by either building a new plant or upgrading an existing conventional pellet plant. The market analysis reveals that the future market for TWPs from BC is expected to lie outside Canada, in the Asia Pacific region, and Europe, unless significant domestic policy measures are introduced to promote Canadian use of TWPs.}

abstract = {Poor thermal conductivity and easy leakage in molten state into the surrounding of the thermal energy storage (TES) system are two major problems of organic phase change materials (OPCMs). This study focuses on the heat conduction enhancement and leakage-proof of the OPCM and a novel shape-stabilized OPCM with decyl alcohol (DA) as TES material, expanded graphite (EG) and nanoparticles as additives is developed. The optimal mass fraction of the porous EG, which serves as the shape-stabilizer and heat conduction enhancer, is determined to be 9% through vacuum drying method. Five different kinds of nanoparticles are selected to further improve the thermal conductivity. The experimental results suggest that the composite PCM DA/MgO/EG possesses the highest thermal conductivity, with a value of 1.873 W/(m·K), which is significantly increased by 11.570 times comparing to pure DA and 1.010 times higher than that of DA/EG. The mechanism of strengthening thermal conductivity by the coupling effect of EG and nano additives is revealed. According to DSC tests, the melting temperature and the melting enthalpy of the ternary composite PCM DA/MgO/EG are 1.1 °C and 194.6 J/g, respectively. The effect of additives on the phase transition temperature and enthalpy of PCMs is also investigated. Depending on the cyclic stability experiments, after 300 charging-discharging cycles, both the phase transition temperature and the melting latent heat of DA/MgO/EG have little change by comparison with those of uncirculated composites, which indicates excellent thermal stability of the material. Finally, the applicability of DA/MgO/EG composite is explored by cold insulation experiment. Overall, the composite in this work has promising prospects in cold chain logistics.}

abstract = {Purpose
This study used a patient-specific model to characterize and compare ideal prostate-specific antigen (PSA) kinetics for low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer after definitive radiation treatment with conventionally fractionated, hypofractionated, stereotactic body radiation therapy, or brachytherapy, both high-dose and low-dose rate.
Methods and Materials
This retrospective analysis includes low- and intermediate-risk patients with prostate cancer treated between 1998 and 2018 at an National Cancer Institute–designated comprehensive cancer center. Demographics and treatment characteristics were prospectively collected. Patients had at least 2 PSA measurements within 24 months of treatment and were free from biochemical recurrence. The incidence of, time to, and risk factors for PSA nadir (nPSA) and bounce (bPSA) were analyzed at 24 months after radiation therapy. Ideal PSA kinetics were characterized for each modality and compared.
Results
Of 1042 patients, 45% had low-risk cancer, 37% favorable intermediate risk, and 19% unfavorable intermediate risk. nPSAs were higher for ablative modalities, both as absolute nPSA and relative to initial PSA. Median time to nPSA ranged from 14.8 to 17.1 months. Over 50% treated with nonablative therapy (conventionally fractionated, hypofractionated, and low-dose rate) reached an nPSA threshold of ≤0.5 ng/mL compared with 23% of stereotactic body radiation therapy and 33% of high-dose rate cohorts. The incidence of bPSA was 13.3% and not affected by treatment modality, Gleason score, or prostate volume. PSA decay rate was faster for ablative therapies in the 6- to 24-month period.
Conclusions
Analysis of PSA within 24 months after radiation therapy revealed ablative therapies are associated with a latent PSA response and higher nPSA. Multivariable logistics modeling revealed younger age, initial PSA above the median, presence of bPSA, and ablative therapy as predictors for not achieving nPSA ≤0.5 ng/mL. PSA decay rate appears to be faster in ablative therapies after a latent period. Understanding the different PSA kinetic profiles is necessary to assess treatment response and survey for disease recurrence.}

However, compared to road transport, rail transport generally lacks the flexibility in delivery quantity and frequency, and exhibits economies of scale in its shipment volume. This often leads to high inventory levels in the destination after deliveries. We generalize the tailored base-surge dual sourcing inventory model by introducing a fixed cost in rail transport, adding an extra decision in its delivery frequency, and relaxing the assumption of the base stock control of road transport, to support firms’ modal split transport optimization. The objective is to optimize the controls of the two transport modes and the corresponding inventory management at the destination, which minimize the combined average transport and inventory costs per period in the steady state. Using stochastic dynamic programming, we find that when the delivery quantity and frequency of rail transport is fixed, the optimal shipment volume via the road transport indeed follows a base stock control. This allows to solve the relevant Bellman equation via an efficient policy iteration approach. We also find that the total cost is convex in the delivery quantity of rail transport, and a bi-section search can be applied. Finally, we analyze the sensitivity and robustness of our model using values suggested by a consumer goods firm.}

Hepatitis B is a major preventable cause of morbidity and mortality from chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. We aimed to evaluate the performance and outcomes of the Korean Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Programme (PHBPP) and to investigate the impact of the current post-exposure immunoprophylaxis protocol.
Methods
A retrospective cohort study was performed based on electronic data registry of infants born to hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected mothers between July 2002 and 2013.
Results
During the study period, 159,983 Korean infants were registered with the PHBPP, with an overall programme coverage of 92.8%. Despite receiving timely post-exposure immunoprophylaxis, 8.6% of infants born to mothers aged <25 years and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive, and 0.7% of infants born to mothers aged ≥25 years and HBeAg-negative were infected. An estimated 14,123 infants were directly protected from perinatal HBV transmission by the PHBPP during the 11.5-year period, at a cost of 1157 US dollars per case averted. The incidence of paediatric hepatocellular carcinoma declined dramatically during the period.
Conclusions
A substantial number of infants have been prevented from hepatitis B since the PHBPP was launched in the Republic of Korea. Continued efforts to promote the programme, an integrated approach to maximising its coverage, a risk-stratified strategy, and innovations in logistics could further reduce perinatal HBV transmission.}

Retailers' joint replenishment and the carbon trading behavior of supply chain members are studied. We assume that three replenishment strategies are available for the supply chain: (1) separate replenishment; (2) joint replenishment: a leader-follower relationship among retailers; and (3) joint replenishment: the coalition of retailers. Under each strategy, a bargaining framework for supply chain members is set up to maximize their profits, where the price of the refrigerated transportation services provided by the supplier and the retail price of fresh food are optimized. The optimal decisions are analyzed to provide insights into logistics pricing and retail pricing strategies. Through comparing three replenishment strategies, we also identify the optimal replenishment strategies from the perspectives of the supplier, retailers and a carbon emission optimizer. Moreover, we investigate the role of the carbon cap-and-trade policy by comparing the cases with and without a carbon cap-and-trade policy. It is noteworthy that the goals of profit growth and emission reduction are simultaneously achieved under the carbon cap-and-trade policy.}

In existing truck-and-UAV delivery models that assume constant or unlimited UAV endurance, the natural conclusion is that operating UAVs at higher speeds will either decrease, or have no adverse effect on, total delivery times. However, in reality, UAV power consumption is a nonlinear function of both speed and parcel weight; flying at high speeds can dramatically reduce flight ranges, thus limiting the effectiveness of these logistics systems. This paper addresses the tradeoffs between speed and range in a new variant of the combined truck/UAV delivery problem in which UAV speeds are treated as decision variables. A three-phased algorithm is provided that dynamically adjusts UAV speeds to achieve superior performance, with the goal of minimizing the total delivery time (or makespan). Results indicate that significant time savings can be achieved by operating UAVs at variable speeds. Furthermore, under certain conditions, optimizing UAV speeds also results in shorter truck travel distances, reduced UAV energy consumption per trip, and less UAV loitering while waiting to rendezvous with the truck.}

The availability of protected agriculture and information technologies promise to open new opportunities, particularly in the fresh produce supply chain. In this paper, we introduce an integrated supply chain planning tool for fresh vegetables that takes into consideration the characteristics and resources of three specific states in Mexico, to make recommendations in terms of the crops to be planted, the timing of planting and harvesting, and what markets to target such that the farmers’ profits are maximized. Also relevant is the selection of the appropriate agriculture technology level (e.g. open field, shade structures, or greenhouse) within each region analyzed. A case study based on fresh produce exporting regions of Mexico is presented. The results of the case study show that the judicious use of protected agriculture technology can render significant additional profits for farmers.}

abstract = {Consolidation of parts is the redesign of an assembled component with fewer, but therefore more complex parts. While complex parts are often difficult to produce with conventional manufacturing (CM) technologies, the high degree of design freedom of additive manufacturing (AM) facilitates consolidation. Typically, consolidation with AM is chosen because of its functional benefits such as weight reductions. Consequences for asset maintenance, however, are not that well understood. For example, the spare parts management may profit from potentially shorter AM resupply lead times, but may suffer from more expensive consolidated parts having to be stocked in anticipation of random failures. In this paper, we analyze the total costs of consolidation with AM, including logistics, manufacturing and repair costs. Our results suggest that consolidation with AM often leads to higher total costs. This finding mainly stems from loss of flexibility. For example, in case of a failure, a consolidated component has to be replaced entirely whereas the conventional assembled component might only require replacement of a defective sub-component. Furthermore, short resupply lead times for the consolidated spare part turn out to have little impact and therefore relativize the benefit of consolidation with AM. Overall, these findings stress the necessity to adopt a total costs perspective when assessing the effects of design changes with AM. Otherwise, design changes may lead to unforeseen effects which may render its application debatable, even despite substantial functionality improvements.}

Nine schools were recruited to participate in the study during the 2019–2020 school year. Schools were assigned to one of three conditions: (1) expert; (2) peer-random (selected peer-leaders would teach to random students); and (3) peer-fixed (selected peer-leaders would teach to assigned students based on nominations). Study participation varied by day due to school attendance, with 686 participants at baseline and 608 at posttest. Almost all students who did not complete the study resulted from the interruption of schools being closed due to COVID-19. Implementation issues fell into three categories: (1) scheduling, (2) day-of logistics, and (3) student group dynamics. Overall, the results showed positive satisfaction among teachers, who unanimously found the program appropriate for the grade-level and that peer-leaders worked well within their groups. Peer-led students—both random and assigned—reported having more fun and willing to tell friends to try the program compared to expert-led students.

This paper tries to incorporate the most relevant information from all the prominent research papers and draw a conclusion on the limitations, observed patterns, and prospects in this theme. Therefore, during 2010–2020, 102 scholarly articles from journals and conferences were reviewed to capture research contribution knowledge, excluding 11 papers from unknown research methodology sources, the global dissemination of ASCM research, and the identification of various crucial components of ASCM. The literature is also classified by geographic area and publication year. Despite the growing demand for an efficient Agriculture Supply Chain, there aren’t many papers emphasizing this theme as a whole. The areas of perishability, food safety and quality, IT application in ASC, logistics, and post-harvest loss are often the priority. Small Data Granularity, Slowed Digital Transformation, Management of Conventional Inventory Strategies, Lack of Actionable Data and Insights can be summarized as Prime Challenges in the Agri-Supply Chain. Specifically, in the study, the selection of any ASC configuration in a specific context has not been accomplished, so a thorough review of various feasible ASCM configurations has to be carried out.

Objectives
We explored phenotypes of high unmet need of patients with bladder cancer and their associated patient demographic, clinical, psychosocial, and functional characteristics.
Data Sources
Patients (N=159) were recruited from the Bladder Cancer Advocacy Network and completed an online survey measuring unmet needs (BCNAS-32), quality of life (FACT-Bl), anxiety and depression (HADS), coping (BRIEF Cope), social support (SPS), and self-efficacy beliefs (GSE). Hierarchical agglomerative (HA) and partitioning clustering (PC) analyses were used to identify and confirm high unmet-need phenotypes and their associated patient characteristics. Results showed a two-cluster solution; a cluster of patients with high unmet needs (17% and 34%, respectively) and a cluster of patients with low-moderate unmet needs (83% and 66%, respectively). These two methods showed moderate agreement (κ=0.57) and no significant differences in patient demographic and clinical characteristics between the two groups. However, the high-need group identified by the HA clustering method had significantly higher psychological (81 vs 66, p < .05), health system (93 vs 74, p < .001), daily living (93 vs 74, P < .001), sexuality (97 vs 69, P < .001), logistics (84 vs 69, P < .001), and communication (90 vs 76, P < .001) needs. This group also had worse quality of life and emotional adjustment and lower personal and social resources (P < .001) compared with the group identified by the PC method.
Conclusion
A significant proportion of patients with bladder cancer continues to have high unique but inter-related phenotypes of needs based on the HA clustering method.
Implications for Nursing Practice
Identifying characteristics of the most vulnerable patients will help tailor support programs to assist these patients with their unmet needs.}

This research provided valuable information to establish guidelines to attract more consumers to participate in SFSCs. The study was approached from a consumer broad perspective, this is done thanks to an analysis of a database that contains three different samples of consumers: active SFSC consumers (N=394), potential SFSC consumers (N=422) and the general public in Spain (N=1,153). The findings suggested that there are common market niches between SFSCs and organic and local food. On the other hand, the correlation between Protected Designation Origin products and SFSCs was weaker and remains unclear. Food information and its health attributes seemed to be key elements to attract consumers to SFSCs. Product quality was a core element for consumers to buy directly to producers. On a second level, rural development support and direct contact with producers were also important drivers of these chains. Lack of convenience and difficulties to find a reliable farmer were the major barriers to buy directly from producers. Furthermore, limited variety and prices were also noteworthy limitations, especially for active consumers in SFSCs. Food safety control was also a remarkable concern for potential SFSC consumers. In Spain, SFSCs have room to grow by covering their potential consumers’ necessities and tackling main inconveniences with the support of well-targeted policies. Producers that are involved in short chains could take advantage of identified market niches, along with providing consumers with valuable food information including health attributes. Policies have to support SFSCs by tackling main identified barriers and bringing producers and consumers closer.}

abstract = {In a world with diverging emission reduction targets, national climate policies might be ineffective in reducing consumption-based CO2 emissions (carbon footprints), i.e. emissions of final demand that are embodied across the whole supply chain, including international fractions. We analyse a set of different policies in three areas with particularly high consumption-based emissions in Austria: building construction, public health, and transport. To capture the substitution possibilities triggered by these policies and the induced emission reductions along the full global supply chain, our analysis combines a Computable General Equilibrium with a Multi-Regional Input-Output model. For construction of buildings we find that a carbon added tax is highly effective in reducing consumption-based emissions whereas an information obligation on vacant dwellings combined with a penalty payment when vacant buildings are not made available is ineffective because of reallocated investment capital. Mandatory energy efficiency improvements in public health and mobility are found equally effective in reducing consumption- and production-based emissions while a decarbonization of freight transport logistics stronger reduces production-based emissions. Overall, the effectiveness of policies, to mitigate consumption-based emissions, is therefore determined by the backward and forward linkages of the sector addressed by the policy as well as the substitution effects within final demand.}

abstract = {Introduction
Many clinical trials terminate early due to safety and efficacy concerns, and less often due to unexpected “positive” findings. However, early termination of post-approval (Phase IV) pragmatic randomized trials for commercial reasons is less frequent, may be more complex, and may require added flexibility in closure methods, including short term follow-up. VOLUME was a randomized, open-label, post-approval pragmatic clinical trial (PCT) or large simple trial that terminated early due to product withdrawal. The aim of this paper is to describe circumstances unique to post-approval PCTs that may require a closure amendment rather than immediate study termination, and our recommendations for operational study closure in these circumstances. We use the VOLUME case study throughout to provide a practical example.
Methods
Study closeout considerations at the study level include: notifying external governance bodies, e.g., data monitoring committees (DMC), and scientific steering committees (SSC); executing a study closure amendment; notifying and training of study physicians; and institutional review board (IRB)/ethics committee (EC) approvals. Study closure considerations at the patient level focus on patient safety and include: patient notification, efficient transition to alternative treatments, the need for re-consenting; and drug supply shortages.
Conclusions
Early study closeout logistics require careful analysis, detailed planning, and close coordination, and are ideally considered at the study planning phase. Lessons learned from the VOLUME closeout should help other researchers devise contingencies when terminating post approval pragmatic trials that utilize a marketed product.

The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of 3D printing a customised implant at the point of care from a manufacturing and logistics perspective. We hypothesised that customised plate production would be possible within a clinically relevant time frame of 72 hours using currently available technology.
Materials and methods
This study uses 6 cadaveric lower limbs to simulate real-life surgical patients. Split-depressed lateral tibial plateau fractures were created in an identical fashion in the cadaveric lower limbs. CT scans of the fractures were obtained and digital reconstructions were used to design customised patient and fracture-specific 3D-printed plates. These were subsequently printed in medical grade stainless steel 316L and post-processed at a local additive manufacturing centre. Surgical fixation of the fractures was then carried out using these plates, following which post-operative X-rays were obtained. The time taken for each step in plate production from the initiation of pre-operative CT scan to the completion of the post-operative X-ray was recorded.
Results
Six customised proximal tibia locking plates were produced with accompanying surgical drill guides. The mean total time taken for plate fabrication from completion of CT scan was approximately 24 hours and 7 minutes, with a maximum of 28 hours and 46 minutes.
Conclusion
Production of patient-specific 3D printed plates for fixation of proximal tibia fractures at the point of care is achievable within a clinically acceptable time frame provided adequate manufacturing facilities and skilled manpower are in place.}

Little is known about real-world risk management practices used by organisations to mitigate MHD and MSD risk. The current study examines risk management policies and practices for MHDs and MSDs in three high risk industry sectors.
Method
Data was collected via interviews with 25 Work, Health & Safety (WHS) Managers from the healthcare, retail, and transport/logistics sectors on risk management practices implemented for stress related MHDs and MSDs in their organisations. The organisational policies and procedures for MHDs and MSDs were assessed for coverage of five key dimensions (reference to, exposure factors, outcomes, assessment, prevention) using an adapted policy score card.
Results
Analysis of interview data identified key themes which impact risk management approaches including: a failure to adopt a comprehensive approach to risk management, and the influences of senior management. Across all three sectors, coverage of physical hazards was more comprehensive in comparison to psychosocial hazards.
Conclusions
Despite recognition that MHDs and MSDs are significant workplace problems, approaches to manage these complex health issues are not based on contemporary evidence. Transactional approaches are used which fail to take account of the multiple interacting hazards associated with the development of work related MHDs and MSDs. Improved guidance material and support from the regulators is required along with education of WHS Managers about how to identify and manage psychosocial hazards to reduce the significant burden of MHD and MSDs.}

Less information is available about the latter. We examined how seedling establishment of glossy buckthorn (Frangula alnus), a non-native shrub that invades forests in eastern North America, is affected by four soil surface treatments – grass-dominated turf, oak leaf litter, pine leaf litter, soil compaction – relative to an untreated control (tilled soil). Data on seedling emergence, survival, growth, and reproduction were collected from 1.5 m2 plots (six per treatment) over two years at the Kingman Research Farm, Madbury, NH, USA. Overall, buckthorn success from seed was inhibited by grass turf and facilitated by oak litter, while pine litter effects were complex and soil compaction had no effect. Specifically, relative to control, the turf treatment reduced buckthorn seedling emergence (year 2 only), increased mortality over two years, reduced density of living buckthorn, and prevented fruiting. Oak litter resulted in greater buckthorn seedling height relative to control, while pine litter, although reducing seedling emergence (year 1 only), increased both seedling height and the proportion of plants fruiting in year 2. Across all treatments and control, buckthorn seedling emergence was greatest in June, declining thereafter. Of the four treatments, only grass turf offered some promise of resisting invasion. The mechanism of resistance by turf is not known, but likely involves either more intense competition or higher levels of herbivory associated with turf. The mechanism, as well as the logistics and cost of turf establishment in logged areas, require further exploration.}

However, the social inequality generated by the social-technical system will bring huge obstacles to the low-carbon consumption transformation. Scholars have studied the carbon emission reduction potential brought by DCI, but they have not paid attention to social inequality. The demand hierarchy of daily consumption activities reflects social inequality, providing a new perspective for the study of social inequality in low-carbon consumption. Therefore, we divided consumption activities into survival, development and luxury according to demand hierarchy, taking DCI as the core independent variable, and socio-economic factors as the control variable into the order logistics model to analyze its direct and interactive effects on low-carbon consumption, and further explore social inequality based on the above results. This study shows that DCI improves the low-carbon level of residents' survival and development consumption activities, but reduces the low-carbon level of luxury consumption activities. The driving force of low-carbon consumption is different between urban and rural areas. Urban residents are actively produced by environmental protection awareness, while rural residents are passively formed under the influence of economic conditions. Education and income are signs of social inequality. Residents with low education and high income tend to be green in survival consumption activities, but luxury consumption activities tend to be high-carbon. DCI increases social inequality, and the social inequality of urban residents conforms to the stratification hypothesis, while the social inequality of rural residents complies with the standardization hypothesis and the stratification hypothesis. The research results are conducive to increasing the positive impact of DCI and reducing social inequality, and provide a scientific and reasonable policy entry point for the transition of low-carbon consumption.}

To evaluate the safety profile and short-term functional outcome of sustainable functional urethral reconstruction (SFUR) in robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP).
Methods
One hundred and sixty-two consecutive prostate cancer patients who underwent RARP were retrospectively analyzed, in which 53 had undergone SFUR while the other 109 had undergone conventional RARP procedures. Immediate, 2-week, 1-month and 3-month continence recovery and other perioperative data were compared to evaluate short-term surgical and functional outcome.
Results
The median age was 68 and 67 years in the experimental group and control group, respectively (p=0.206), with a median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) of 13.6 ng/mL (interquartile range [IQR], 8.46–27.32 ng/mL) in the experimental group and 13.84 ng/mL (IQR, 9.12–26.80 ng/mL) in control group (p=0.846). Immediate, 2-week, 1-month and 3-month continence recovery rates between the groups were 34.0% vs. 3.7%, 50.9% vs. 14.7%, 62.3% vs. 27.5%, and 79.2% vs. 63.3% (all p<0.05). The morphological changes made by the new reconstruction technique were maintained on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 3 months postoperatively. Nerve-sparing procedures and adoption of the new reconstruction technique were significantly relevant to continence recovery on logistics regression model (p<0.001).
Conclusions
SFUR is a safe and easy-to-handle modification that may contribute to early continence return for RARP. Long-term follow-up and prospective studies are required to further evaluate its value in postoperative quality-of-life improvement.}

This paper evaluates the role of incentives for zero and near-zero emission vehicle (ZEV) technologies in last-mile delivery operations. Specifically, the study investigates the total cost of ownership and life cycle environmental impacts associated with last-mile deliveries, and compares the private and public costs of different vehicle powertrain and fuel pathways, under existing incentives in the State of California. The study analyzes driving patterns for several last-mile delivery vocations, including beverage, warehouse, parcel, grocery, food and local deliveries based on real-world truck travel data. Statistical analyses are conducted to compare driving patterns across vocations, vehicle classes, and powertrains, as well as across parcel carrier fleets. To better assess the role of the incentives, the study also provides a comparative estimate of the marginal health damages from life cycle emissions of criteria pollutants (e.g. $/ton). Our results suggest that parcel deliveries are characterized by short trips (95% less than 100 miles), a high number of stops, and lower average driving speeds compared to other delivery vocations. Total cost of ownership for conventional diesel Class 3 to 6 vehicles used in last mile applications were estimated to be approximately between $282 and $305 thousand dollars, with the cost of negative health impacts ranging from $38 to $64 thousand dollars over the vehicle lifetime. The results show that battery electric freight vehicles are cost competitive with conventional diesel vehicles, particularly for smaller (Class 3) light commercial vehicles. Available financial incentives were sufficient to offset additional purchase and fuel expenses, leading to lower total costs of ownership.}

CO2 compression and conditioning not only contributes to the overall energy penalty of Carbon Capture Utilisation and Storage (CCUS), it also influences the logistics surrounding the transportation network. The techno-economic feasibility of transporting CO2 through pipelines or in storage vessels has been reported extensively. However, the conclusions in the existing studies are case specific, and focus on either the CO2 source or the end-point. Whereas, in large CCUS clusters/networks, a range of sources will need to be interlinked and be able to supply conditioned CO2 to various transportation options. With the prospect of multi-national CCUS transportation infrastructures, the link between CO2 source and transport needs to be clearly characterised. Herein, a process model for a CO2 compression train is constructed in gPROMS gCCS, based off the IEAGHG base case B0 for post-combustion capture and compression. The model is capable of conditioning the CO2 stream to the required outlet pressure, temperature and composition. The results compare various CO2 streams from capture plants attached to a range of CO2 sources including power generation and industry. The findings highlight the power requirement for conditioning to various end point characteristics, specifically the level of moisture control required for different pipeline options. This analysis can also be used alongside economic evaluations to enable the cost-effective deployment of CCUS transport networks, and aid in forming effective CCUS clusters.}

Earlier studies suggest that shifts may occur towards heavy vehicles, due to the relative inefficiency of lighter vehicles types. However, these studies have not taken into account the effects of changes in shipment size, as a response to pricing measures. Also, these studies have not considered emission-class dependent charges. Thirdly, no empirical disaggregate models or studies are available for the Netherlands for this problem. We present a discrete choice model for the joint choice of vehicle type and shipment size, estimated on a large dataset of disaggregate carrier freight trip data. The model explains variations in vehicle type choice for different transport purposes and contexts (e.g. commodity type, long-haul, urban transport, to/from logistic nodes). The analysis of emission based truck charging schemes shows that substitution towards low emission vehicles can be expected within the same vehicle class. It is also not likely that the truck charge will lead to a significant increase of shipment sizes or to substitution between vehicle types: a distance based truck charge increases transport costs but inventory costs restrain a shift to larger shipment sizes. This result points to a limited capability of supply chains to absorb transport cost increases by logistics re-organisation.}

Non-compliance with ISC can lead to severe consequences and penalties, e.g., dangerous effects due to undesired drug interactions. ISC might stem from regulatory documents, extracted by domain experts. Another source for ISC are process execution logs. Process execution logs store execution information for process instances, and hence, inherently, the effects of ISC.

This study focuses on how a shipping intermediary such as a fourth-party logistics (4PL) provider can enable efficiency gains in retail container distribution. We consider the assignment of cargo to containers and vessels to accommodate downstream retailer demand, aiming to minimize both environmental and economic costs. We develop an integer optimization model that represents the key decisions of which journeys to select to ship various types, and quantities, of products onto containers of various sizes. We generate problem instances using international supply chain data inspired by two large United Kingdom (UK) retailers. Our model is useful for evaluating the feasibility of coopetition in container shipping, which we define as a contractual agreement with a 4PL, of which consolidation is one operational dimension. We conduct a variety of sensitivity analyses around the cost of fuel, cost of carbon emissions, and under coopetition or competition, to better understand their effects on model outcomes. Although some studies have mentioned that coopetition can prove economically beneficial, our study has shown that for the data and model we consider, the advantages of coopetition are quite limited. Our findings suggest there are limited economic or environmental benefits associated with the competition or coopetition scenarios when only fuel costs increase. The greatest benefits from an environmental perspective occur when joint increases of fuel and CO2 costs occur, which result in greater environmental co-benefits in the coopetition case. Alternatively, CO2 cost increases show that competition contexts had greater environmental benefit.}

The model forecasts are based on past temperatures, forecasted temperatures and time variables, which include markers for holidays and other occasional events. The models were trained and tested on gas-consumption data gathered in the city of Ljubljana, Slovenia. Machine-learning models were considered, such as linear regression, kernel machine and artificial neural network. Additionally, empirical models were developed based on data analysis.

In this study, a new application of the ultraviolet optical screening tool (UVOST) equipped with electrical conductivity measurement (UVOST-EC) is proposed to delineate a water-covered sediment contaminated with dioxins and furans in a decommissioned pulp and paper wastewater stabilization basin. Bench scale experiments are presented that were used to develop a UVOST-EC interpretation method for delineating between two different sediment types present in the basin: an anthropogenically derived organic rich contaminated sediment (“black sediment”) and a naturally occurring grey organic silt sediment with marine provenance (“grey sediment”). The method involves comparative analysis of fluorescence and electrical conductivity signatures between the two sediments. Results indicate that each sediment type presents unique “signatures” related to fluorescence and electrical signals which corresponds to variability in their physio-chemical structure. Almost 100 UVOST-EC tests performed at the study site were paired with ex situ physical gravity core measurements of the black sediment to test the accuracy of the UVOST-EC-based method. A statistical analysis at seven sample “cluster” sites (i.e. multiple sub-samples within a defined area) indicated that the mean of sediment thickness obtained by the UVOST-EC measurement technique at a given site were not significantly different (p = 0.05) from measurements derived from sediment gravity core measurements. The UVOST-EC-based sediment thickness delineation method reliably determined the thickness of the dioxin and furan contaminated sediments as compared to gravity core determination for the sediment in this study. Application of this approach to other studies should be assessed in a similar manner. The UVOST-EC method offers health and safety, cost, logistics, and data interpretation benefits.}

abstract = {Introduction
As of 2018, 118 of 194 WHO Member States reported the presence of an influenza vaccination policy. Although influenza vaccination policies do not guarantee equitable access or ensure vaccination coverage, they are critical to establishing a coordinated influenza vaccination program, which can reduce morbidity and mortality associated with yearly influenza, especially in high-risk groups. Established programs can also provide a good foundation for pandemic preparedness and response.
Methods
We utilized EXCEL and STATA to evaluate changes to national seasonal influenza vaccination policies reported on the WHO/UNICEF Joint Reporting Forms on Immunization (JRF) in 2014 and 2018. To characterize countries with or without policies, we incorporated external data on World Bank income groupings, WHO regions, and immunization system strength (using 3 proxy indicators).
Results
From 2014 to 2018 there was a small net increase in national seasonal influenza vaccination policies from 114 (59%) to 118 (61%). There was an increase in policies targeting high-risk groups from 34 in 2014 (34 /114 policies, 29%) to 56 (56/118 policies, 47%) in 2018. Policies were consistently more frequent in high-income countries, in WHO Regions of the Americas (89% of countries) and Europe (89%), and in countries satisfying all three immunization system strength indicators. Low and low-middle income countries, representing 40% of the worlds’ population, accounted for 52/61 (85%) of countries with no evidence of a policy in either year.
Conclusion
Our results demonstrate that national influenza vaccination policies vary significantly by region, income, and immunization system strength, and are less common in lower-income countries. Barriers to establishing and maintaining policies should be further examined as part of international efforts to expand influenza vaccination policies globally. Next generation influenza vaccine development should work to address barriers to influenza vaccination policy adoption, such as cost, logistics for adult vaccination, country priorities, need for yearly vaccination, and variations in seasonality.}

Este trabajo presenta la experiencia de gestión por los servicios de salud pública de la ciudad de Barcelona de dos programas de prevención universal del consumo de sustancias adictivas ofrecidos en educación secundaria, revisando el periodo de 1989-1990 a 2016-2017. Ambos programas mostraron su efectividad en evaluaciones con grupo de comparación, se promueven desde los servicios de salud pública de forma gratuita y son impartidos por los/las docentes usando manuales estandarizados, con material de apoyo y formación. La cobertura alcanzada en los últimos años ha bajado del 40% al 25% de las escuelas. Se observan cambios en la aceptación y la realización de los programas que podrían relacionarse con aspectos de seguimiento y logística de los servicios de salud pública, los cambios en la disponibilidad de sustancias psicoactivas y los recortes presupuestarios en educación. La monitorización de los programas efectivos por los servicios de salud pública es fundamental para preservar su realización.
This paper documents the management of two programs for the universal prevention of substance use offered in secondary schools by the public health services of the city of Barcelona, reviewing the period from 1989–1990 to 2016–2017. Both programs had proven effectiveness in evaluations with a comparison group, they are promoted by the public health agency free of cost, and are taught by teachers, using standardized manuals with support materials and training. The coverage achieved over recent years declined from 40% to 25%. Changes observed in the acceptance and implementation of these programs could be related with logistics and follow-up by the public health services, changes in substance availability, and with budget cuts in education. The monitoring of effective programs by public health services is essential to preserve their actual implementation.}

This work summarizes hydrothermal co-liquefaction of various biomass, in which co-liquefaction effect (either synergistic, antagonistic or additive) on biocrude yield of was examined. Observed synergetic effects must be critically assessed due to inconsistent reaction/separation conditions, uncertain statistical significance of experimental data and varied indicator of co-liquefaction effect in the studies reported. The chemical interactions among biomass model components (cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, lipid, and protein) were also thoroughly investigated to explore the origin of co-liquefaction effect. Recent progresses on modeling hydrothermal liquefaction was reviewed as well, including quantitative models for predicting product yield as a function of the biochemical composition of biomass feedstock and/or reaction parameters, and kinetics models of reaction network among individual component of biomass. These models are useful tools to investigate co-liquefaction effect, optimize feedstock mixing for co-liquefaction, and ultimately facilitate more efficient biomass conversion. The major challenges in the study of co-liquefaction are identified such as statistical significance of co-liquefaction effect, evaluation of co-liquefaction effect under identical liquefaction and separation conditions, and understanding of co-liquefaction effect at a molecular level.}

Background
The effectiveness of heterologous prime-boost Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) vaccination is currently unknown.
Methods
From individuals vaccinated with two doses against Covid-19 in Sweden until July 5, 2021 (N=3,445,061), we formed a study cohort including 94,569 individuals that had received heterologous ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 / BNT162b2 prime-boost vaccination, 16,402 individuals that received heterologous ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 / mRNA-1273 prime-boost vaccination, and 430,100 individuals that received homologous ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 / ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 prime-boost vaccination. In addition, 180,716 individuals were selected who were unvaccinated at the date of vaccination in the corresponding case. Unvaccinated individuals were censored at first dose of any vaccine. Baseline was the date of the second dose of any vaccine, with the same date in the corresponding unvaccinated individual. The outcome included incident symptomatic Covid-19 infection occurring >14 days after baseline.
Findings
During a mean follow-up time of 76 (range 1-183) days, symptomatic Covid-19 infection was confirmed in 187 individuals with heterologous vaccine schedules (incidence rate: 2.0/100,000 person-days) and in 306 individuals from the unvaccinated control group (incidence rate: 7.1/100,000 person-days). The adjusted vaccine effectiveness was 67% (95% CI, 59-73, P<0.001) for heterologous ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 / BNT162b2 prime-boost vaccination, and 79% (95% CI, 62-88, P<0.001) for heterologous ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 / mRNA-1273 prime-boost vaccination. When combined and analysed together, the two heterologous vaccine schedules had an effectiveness of 68% (95% CI, 61-74, P<0.001) which was significantly greater (Pinteraction<0.001) than the 50% effectiveness for homologous ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 / ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (95% CI, 41-58, P<0.001).
Interpretation
The findings of this study suggest that the use of heterologous ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and mRNA prime-boost vaccination is an effective alternative to increase population immunity against Covid-19, including against the Delta variant which dominated the confirmed cases during the study period. These findings could have important implications for vaccination strategies and logistics, and consequently in the battle against the Covid-19 pandemic.}

However, the state of the art approach is based on private access to such data, under specific contract requirements, and it becomes a limitation to the evolution of the concept itself. In particular it becomes limiting when the CMfgs involve multiple process owners distributed throughout a complex value creating network, such as production, logistics, quality control, but also, third parties like auditor interested in energy consumption, or machine maintenance provider, also interested in monitoring the effective usage of the machines, etc. This paper will analyze deeply the structural and functional characteristics of such CMfgs and then, it will propose a business intelligence architecture that aims to enable publishing relevant KPIs related to interested process data, with the convenient layer of trustworthiness. Such public access will enable the assessment to different agents at different time frequency and, finally, with different motivation, thus bringing practical information about time delays for the data availability and scalability factors.}

The novel coronavirus and subsequent pandemic have drastically transfigured health care delivery. Surgical specialties have seen severe alterations or reductions to practice, with neurosurgery being one example in which staff and resource reallocation has occurred to meet wider public health needs. This review summarizes the published evidence detailing early experiences and changes to neurosurgical practice in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
Methods
A systematic review was conducted up until April 21, 2020 in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, by searching Medline, EMBASE, PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Central, and Web of Science Core Collection databases. Individual studies were qualitatively assessed to outline core themes detailing changes to practice. Iterative analysis allowed themes to be developed and applied to all studies included in the review.
Results
In total, 13 themes from 18 studies were identified, grouped into 3 overriding themes: logistics, human resources, and clinical delivery. Studies originated from 3 of the most affected countries (United States, China, and Italy), comprising expert opinions, letters to the editor, editorials, case reports, or perspective pieces. The commonest themes discussed include cancellation of elective operations, reduction in outpatient services, and pandemic rotas.
Conclusions
This review summarizes the early responses of the neurosurgical community to the COVID-19 pandemic and presents a menu of interventions to be considered in future pandemic response, or in recurrent outbreaks of COVID-19. Whilst our review is limited by the low quality of evidence and rapid rate of change in our understanding of COVID-19, it provides a valuable summary of initial responses by the neurosurgical community to a global pandemic.}

The performance of MMH tasks should be assessed using multiple criteria rather than being merely cost-oriented, considering the fact that the lot size affects the workload and can result in work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs). This study aims to integrate biomechanical and physiological guidelines into a cost-based performance optimization model of MMH tasks. In this study, we consider the impact of lot size on lifting frequency, which is reflected in the Composite Lifting Index (CLI), an extension of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). In addition, the energy expenditure rates of operators are estimated by applying an established physiological method. The energy expenditure results are used to calculate rest allowance during a handling process that help keep workload levels acceptable. To make the model more general, we consider different manual material shipping scenarios and intermodal replenishment cases. Finally, a sustainable lot-sizing model is applied in a two-stage intermodal replenishment case and several numerical experiments to determine the influence of item weight, speed, distance, and opportunity cost. The results indicate that the proposed model can ease the ergonomic strain of operators without compromising economic efficiency.}

The aim of this research is to observe the effect of temperature during carbonization of banana peels and its impact on densification of banana peel to produce a high quality of briquette. Carbonization temperature of banana peels was carried at three different temperatures of 270 (C270), 370 (C370) and 470 (C470) oC. The densification of carbonized banana peel was 40.0 tons. Furthermore, densification also performed on the non-carbonization of banana peel (NC) on order to compare the results without presence of any binder materials. Initial results involved proximate analysis to fulfill the briquette standard requirement and compressive analysis to investigate the strength of briquette. The proximate analysis shown that moisture content of carbonized briquettes were about 5.00 to 6.06 %, ash content were about 20.59 to 30.03 %, volatile matter were about 61.91 to 70.15 % and fixed carbon were about 2.00 to 3.80 % respectively. These findings quite different with non-carbonized briquette. In addition, the compressive analysis obtained that the non-carbonized (NC) briquette produce the highest compressive load limit. Compressive analysis is important to know the ability of briquette to resist the load for logistics purposes. The preliminary results support the idea that banana peels waste are potential to be process as a briquette of solid biofuel.}

In this paper, we assess the effectiveness of the PI for dealing with various disruptions in an integrated production-inventory-distribution system. To attain this, we constructed a two-stage stochastic programming model which captures the main characteristics of the PI and incorporates pre-event and post-event mitigation strategies in an integrated way. In the first stage (before disruptions), pre-event mitigation strategies are identified, while in addition to post-event mitigation strategies, the production, inventory, ordering and pickup and delivery route plans are determined in the second stage (after disruptions). Then a two-level heuristic algorithm that combines a three-phase heuristic and a fix-and-optimize procedure is developed to solve the model effectively. To evaluate the model, risk mitigation strategies and the two-level heuristic algorithm, extensive numerical experiments were conducted based on several realistic instances. The results demonstrate that the developed algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art solver in terms of solution quality and computational time. The results also indicate that tremendous cost and service level benefits can be achieved by adopting the proposed risk mitigation strategies. Compared with the traditional and horizontal collaborative systems, the PI-enabled system attains better performance in terms of the total cost and service levels. Finally, sensitivity analysis showed that the PI-enabled system has significant performance advantages when a range of parameter values were varied.}

The process included completing a needs assessment of both undergraduate and graduate level programs across three campuses and identifying regulatory requirements and limitations for clinical experiences. The task force utilized the information gathered to develop evidence-based recommendations for simulation hour equivalence ratios and compiled a list of virtual activities and products faculty could use to complete clinical experiences. Undergraduate and graduate student surveys were conducted to determine the effectiveness of the transition to virtual clinical experiences. Overall, the majority of survey results were positive regarding virtual simulation experiences providing students with valuable opportunities to enhance their learning. Negative comments regarding the impact of COVID-19 on a personal level included issues involving internet access and web conferencing logistics, lack of motivation to study, family difficulties, and faculty inexperience teaching in an online environment. Undergraduate pre-licensure students were provided with opportunities to successfully complete all remaining required clinical hours virtually, while graduate students were allowed to complete non-direct care hours as applicable using virtual clinical experiences.}

To design a sustainable low-carbon supply chain network, we consider a carbon emission-compliance green location-inventory problem. It is characterized by uncertain demand and volatile carbon prices under a multi-year emission regulation, inspired from the carbon-trading scheme in China. A two-stage stochastic mathematical model is built and is solved with a three-phase hierarchical metaheuristic on extensive numerical experiments, which mimic the business context of a supply chain network operated in China. The results show to which extent the carbon-trading emission-compliance scheme, with uncertainties in demand and carbon price, impacts the strategic decisions. Besides, carbon emissions and supply chain profits of the design solutions produced under alternative emission regulations are evaluated and discussed. We also underline the sensitivity of the amount of carbon emissions to the demand uncertainty, and to the level and volatility of the carbon price in the carbon-trading system. These results provide managerial insights for supply chain emitters, and indicate that reasonable and stable carbon prices should be maintained by governments in emerging markets.}

In light of this gap, this paper systematically reviews the literature on SCF with the objective of clarifying the relationship between SCF actors, instruments, and contextual factors. The review identified three main archetypes for this relationship: fixed-asset financing (fixed asset-centric), inventory financing (inventory-centric), accounts receivable/accounts payable financing (buyer-centric and supplier-centric). Based on the results of the review, the authors discuss the implications for practitioners and further research for academics.}

abstract = {Following the guaranteed service approach (GSA), several studies have investigated the interaction between production and inventory decisions in multistage supply systems and developed efficient algorithms to solve the large-scale optimization problems that emerge. These works have largely ignored limited inventory budgets and their effect on production and inventory decisions. In reality, however, firms tend to limit the amount of capital tied-up in inventories, and there is usually a limited amount of storage space at a warehouse or a retailer. This study investigates the problem of production capacity and safety stock placement with both limited capacity and inventory budgets in general acyclic supply chains. This problem allocates capacity to production stages and sets inventory targets at logistics stages, with the objective to minimize the expected total supply chain cost while meeting a target customer service level. The present paper contributes to the GSA literature in several ways. First, we compare guaranteed and chance-constraint approaches to model limited inventory budgets and analyze their effect on safety stock placement. Second, we present two new equivalent formulations of the production capacity and safety stock placement problem. Solving these new models using a successive piecewise linear approximation algorithm outperforms existing solution procedures in terms of solution quality and time, in both cases of infinite and finite inventory budgets. Third, taking advantage of the structure of these formulations, we develop a two-phase heuristic, which finds optimal or near-optimal solutions and greatly improves CPU times. Finally, our numerical experiments show that inventory budgets affect production capacity and safety stock placement decisions, increasing both work in process (WIP) and safety stock levels.}

abstract = {With the development of the electric vehicle (EV) technology, the electric vehicle routing problems (EVRPs) have become a current focus for research. Although customer demands in the logistics service industry are often uncertain during the route planning stage, these demands have seldom been discussed in the existing literature on the EVRPs. This study presents an electric vehicle battery swap station (BSS) location-routing problem with stochastic demands, with the aim to determine a minimum cost scheme including the optimal number and location of BSSs with an optimal route plan based on stochastic customer demands. Furthermore, the classical recourse policy and preventive restocking policy are extended by considering the influences of both battery and vehicle capacity simultaneously. Subsequently, the concept of Pareto optimality is applied to the EVRP to expedite the selection of BSS sequences. To solve such a hybrid problem, a hybrid variable neighborhood search (HVNS) algorithm is proposed, which integrates the binary particle swarm optimization and variable neighborhood search to solve the location and routing problems interactively. In experimental studies, the HVNS is compared to five heuristic algorithms to verify its performance.}

This paper concerns the work carried out in a bus manufacturing organization with the aim of improving efficiency in its hybrid warehouse. A hybrid warehouse could be considered as one that mixes several different activities (reception, storage area, picking, shipping, supply to production lines and production preparation tasks) and brings together many different materials or raw materials and components. This factor led to the appearance of innumerable management methods to improve employee performance. These are intended to meet the needs of their customers, from the motto "do more with less". The work developed in a hybrid warehouse allows to detect logistic complaints related to communication failures between employees, the reduced efficiency in the activities like the check of raw materials or components and respective picking, the lack of space for their reception and storage, and the non-compliance of the FIFO stock management system. It is imperative that organizations can redefine internal spaces and flows, generating a more efficient and intuitive work and admit an opportunity for improvements in terms of space and content management, and hence, cost savings for an organization. The combination of Lean tools was implemented, and the results have been checked, showing a significant impact in the hybrid warehouse, with annual gains through the optimization of several activities: employee turnover (decrease by 50%), check and picking times (decrease about 75 minutes/picking) and better working conditions for employees.}

Subsequent to the introduction of sustainable development and industrial ecology, the idea to create Eco-Industrial Parks based upon the exchange of resources has been acknowledged as a promising strategy to address these issues. The creation of a materials and energy exchange network through processes coupling, also called industrial symbiosis, is achievable in mainly heavy industrial complexes. Business parks with “lighter” industry or service-based companies can improve their sustainability through different approaches. Other types of collaborations can be envisaged such as shared services for the employees and companies, collective logistics or joint research and development. Moreover, reflections could also be orientated towards the park's design and infrastructure planning. From those observations, a new type of Eco-Industrial Park is introduced: the mixed-use ecopark. The mixed-use ecopark is a more accessible archetype, better suited to the case of business parks with service-based companies. Arguing that the mixed-use ecopark is systemic, a conceptual framework is proposed following Le Moigne's systemic modeling approach. Systemic modeling describes the mixed-use ecopark through its objectives, its environment and its structure. It gives a robust yet flexible framework for the future development of a sustainability performance measurement system for the mixed-use ecopark.}

abstract = {Objectives
Recent legislation to expand pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) screening and dispensing in pharmacies may significantly improve PrEP access for people at a high risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission. Studies have shown that pharmacists show wide support for PrEP expansion in pharmacies. However, pharmacy technicians are often the first point of contact for patients in pharmacies and are required to implement many of the tasks to ensure patients of a pharmacy receive adequate services. The purpose of this study was to assess pharmacists’ and pharmacy technicians’ perspectives regarding the implementation of PrEP screening and dispensing.
Methods
We qualitatively examined whether pharmacy technicians’ (n = 6) support and perceived barriers to screening and dispensing PrEP in pharmacies were concordant with those of pharmacists (n = 7). Pharmacy staff were recruited from high-risk HIV neighborhoods in Atlanta, GA using AIDSVu (Atlanta, GA). Two independent coders used MAXQDA (Berlin, Germany) and performed thematic data analysis and unitization to determine agreement.
Results
Pharmacists and pharmacy technicians expressed strong willingness and support for screening and dispensing PrEP in pharmacies. Both groups expressed concerns about the time and the resources needed to perform PrEP screening and dispensing. Technicians, however, also reported concerns about privacy for patients, the need for community support and awareness of pharmacy-based PrEP screening, and recommended scheduling of PrEP screening activities during a limited part of the day to facilitate screening. Pharmacists reported fewer barriers but reported a need for more training of pharmacy staff to assist with PrEP screening and dispensing implementation.
Conclusion
Pharmacy technicians discussed more barriers compared with pharmacists who were largely centered around practical considerations (i.e., logistics and workflow) that may affect the success of PrEP screening and dispensing. Given technicians’ pivotal role in the pharmacy, implementation of pharmacy-based PrEP services should address technicians’ perceived barriers in addition to those of pharmacists.}

In this study, the data of 781 respondents from a carefully designed survey is used to analyze the influential factors of consumers’ willingness to pay for green packaging. By employing the principal factor analysis method, four principal factors affecting consumers’ willingness to pay are uncovered: environment, green packaging quality, commodity, and packaging price. According to the estimation results, even though the majority of consumers have insufficient certain knowledge regarding green packaging, they have a fairly strong willingness to pay for it. Additionally, we observed that compared with the price and appearance of green packaging, consumers would like to attach greater importance to the practicality of green packaging, such as convenience, reusability, and protective capability.}

First, the rates of excreta generation, FS generation and FS collection were quantified based on literature, census and FS discharge data obtained from treatment plants in the study area. Next, we mapped the FS collection to the administrative areas in GAMA based on discharge records obtained from Lavender Hill, the main faecal treatment (FTP) and estimated the travel distance and travel time from the various FS desludging neighbourhoods to the plant. The results of the study show that the excreta and FS generation rates in GAMA are 604 L/cap/yr and 4,137 L/cap/yr, respectively. About 1 million m3 of FS was collected and treated in the study area in 2018, with a collection rate of 244 L/cap/yr. The private sector dominates this collection, haulage and treatment of FS in GAMA. The GIS analysis has provided fundamental data that will be useful in rationalising the FS emptying and transport cost in the study area. Moreover, it revealed that about 20–40% of the localities were outside the 15–25 km sustainable maximum transport distance recommended by some scholars. Finally, the findings highlight the importance of looking beyond administrative boundaries when planning for FS management logistics and infrastructure and also show that the most impoverished communities in the Accra metropolis may not necessarily be the least served when it comes to FS collection and haulage.}

A material handling system is an essential component of a modern manufacturing system, and its energy consumption (EC) is a non-negligible part when evaluating the total production EC. As typical transport equipment, automated guided vehicles (AGVs) have been widely applied in various types of manufacturing workshops. Correspondingly, AGV path planning is usually a multi-objective optimization problem, and closely related to the workshop logistics efficiency and the smoothness of the whole manufacturing process. However, the optimization objectives that current AGV path planning research mostly focuses on are transport distance, time, and cost, while EC or EC-related environmental impact indicators are seldom touched on. To address this, an investigation into the energy-saving oriented path planning is executed for a single-load AGV in a discrete manufacturing workshop environment. Based on the analysis of AGV EC characteristics from the perspective of motion state and vehicle structure, transport distance and EC are selected as two optimization objectives, and an energy-efficient AGV path planning (EAPP) model is formulated. Further, two solution methods, i.e., the two-stage solution method and the particle swarm optimization-based method, are put forward to solve the established model. Moreover, the experimental study verifies the effectiveness of the proposed model and its solution methods and indicates that transport task execution order has a significant impact on AGV transport EC.}

The EU-ETS requires emission allowances for CO2 emissions, except if they result from the combustion of Sustainable Aviation Fuels. These fuels are drop-in fuels, i.e., they are fully compatible with conventional aviation turbine fuel, supply infrastructure and aircraft. However, the current EU-ETS regulation to account for the use of sustainable fuels requires their designated /separate logistics to the airport tank farm. This is technically unnecessary, and both environmentally and economically disadvantageous. It thus represents a barrier for the widespread use of Sustainable Aviation Fuels. Against this background, criteria for an advanced accounting methodology are defined and three different chain of custody concepts are evaluated against them. The most suitable solution is based on a book and claim principle, an approach approved by EU institutions in other industries facing similar circumstances. It balances the fuel's technical potential, the administrative burden for the aviation industry and fundamental EU-ETS requirements, like fraud protection. The latter is ensured by the uniform excise tax supervision in the EU. Finally, a holistic layout of a book and claim concept to account for the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuels in the EU-ETS is proposed.}

Disruptions to critical infrastructures have impaired the ability to ensure sustainable daily operations and have caused further failures in other systems. Along with resource allocation and pre-evacuation, highway networks profoundly impact disaster response and recovery, particularly emergency disaster logistics and rescues. This study reviews the highway vulnerability assessments in Taiwan and examines the resilience of highway networks in regard to failures from the perspectives of interdependency. Analytical results demonstrate that the accessibility of emergency medical facilities plays an essential role in highway resilience in Taiwan. Moreover, the connectivity is critical for metropolitan road network resilience, whereas remote highway resilience is associated with the exposures with insufficient self-protection capacities. The proposed method can assist planners in understanding the assessment tools for highway resilience and help decision makers prioritise their adaptation strategies to improve serviceability of the road network during hazardous conditions.}

We evaluate the potential advantages and disadvantages of commercial parking bays and provide routing solutions based on the given context and stakeholder objectives. To ensure the needs of the stakeholders and the possibility of a near future implementation in the dynamic real-world system, we chose a combined approach of simulation and mathematical optimization, which allows us to investigate the concept efficiently and with a high reliability. By means of an agent-based simulation model as well as a mixed-integer linear model, we establish a heuristic routing solution for minimizing both emissions and delivery durations. We consider different scenarios in which customers are visited in a delivery radius, around a specific commercial parking bay. Outside this radius, delivery operations are conducted through second-row parking activities. Our results for the area of investigation show that the investigated scenario featuring a 200-m delivery radius around the parking bays has a 29.8% emission savings potential compared to traditional parcel delivery procedures. Moreover, optimizing the delivery routes with our green vehicle routing approach has indicated an additional savings potential of 26.4% in terms of delivery duration and 16.4% in terms of emission output for traditional parcel deliveries. Concerning the individual evaluation of the logistics context, our results indicate that dedicated commercial parking bays could be attractive to most urban stakeholders when employed utilizing a hybrid approach, combining traditional delivery activities with commercial parking bay fulfillment.}

A direct impact of this combined activity has been a managed reduction in kerbside capacity with significant impacts to loading zones for freight and servicing. All this is also occurring when last mile logistics activity is increasing substantially primarily as a result of eCommerce activity. While accommodating business growth with reduced kerbside capacity, the approaches taken to manage freight over the last three years have resulted in some intrinsic successes for transport network demands. Some of this owes to policies and infrastructure plans established long before the last few years while some is down to ongoing current work and perseverance. For all aspects of the transport network management, a primary goal throughout this ongoing transformation is keeping Sydney CBD successful and vibrant for business.

This paper examines how space for freight is being provided and managed throughout this transformation period from the perspective of a network manager. It examines how space is used, how this changes in the face of capacity and social challenges and, the outcomes realised to date.

The Trials within Cohorts (TwiCs) design is an alternative for pragmatic randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and might overcome disadvantages such as difficult recruitment, dropout after randomization to control, and contamination. We investigated the applicability of the TwiCs design in an exercise oncology study regarding the recruitment process, representativeness of the study sample, contamination, participation, and dropout.
Methods
The Utrecht cohort for Multiple BREast cancer intervention studies and Long-term evaLuAtion (UMBRELLA) Fit TwiCs evaluates an exercise intervention in inactive breast cancer patients. Eligible patients participating in the prospective UMBRELLA were identified and randomized. Patients randomized to the intervention (n = 130) were offered the intervention, whereas controls (n = 130) were not informed.
Results
Fifty-two percent (n = 68) accepted the intervention. Because this rate was lower than expected, a larger sample size was required than initially estimated (n = 166). However, recruitment of 260 patients was still completed by one researcher within 30 months. Unselective eligibility screening and randomization before invitation improved representativeness. Disadvantage of the design might be inclusion of ineligible patients when cohort information is limited. Furthermore, the design faced higher noncompliance in the intervention group, but prevention of contamination.
Conclusion
The TwiCs design improved logistics in recruitment and prevented contamination, but noncompliance due to refusal of the intervention was higher compared with conventional pragmatic exercise oncology RCTs, which may dilute the estimated intervention effect.}

So far, regulatory authorities from many countries have approved nine vaccines with phase 3 results. In the current pandemic, a paradigm for the COVID-19 vaccine development has arisen, as many challenges must be overcome. Mass-production and cold-chain storage to immunize large human populations should be feasible and fast, and a combination of different vaccines may boost logistics and immunization. In silico trials is an emerging and innovative field that can be applied to predict and simulate immune, molecular, clinical, and epidemiological outcomes of vaccines to refine, reduce, and partially replace steps in vaccine development. Vaccine-resistant variants of SARS-CoV-2 might emerge, leading to the necessity of updates. A globally fair vaccine distribution system must prevail over vaccine nationalism for the world to return to its pre-pandemic status.}

abstract = {The replacement of traditional petroleum-based surfactants with renewable biosurfactants is a key part of the transition towards a circular economy. Sophorolipids are the most commercially adopted biosurfactant due to the existence of high productivity fermentation process, excellent surface and interfacial tension properties and because the main producer organism Starmerella bombicola is non-pathogenic/non-GMO. However, the current large-scale production of sophorolipids still utilizes purified substrates such as glucose and oleic acid. This is a major reason their price is an order of magnitude higher than traditional surfactants, severely limiting their commercial adoption. Hence, implementation of sophorolipid production from alternative biomass byproducts and wastes is crucial. This review illustrates the potential performance of alternative feedstocks as sources of sugars, fatty acids and nitrogen for sophorolipid production. Important studies where alternative feedstocks outperformed purified substrates under the same conditions, as well as high overall production of sophorolipid using sophisticated fermentation schemes are highlighted. Promising performance such as productivities of up to 2.4 g/L/h currently exist with processes based on alternative feedstocks. Important knowledge gaps within the literature are also identified, such as the need to combine alternative feedstocks to eliminate the use of purified substrates. Future improvement of productivity on alternative feedstocks could be achieved via implementation of sophisticated fermentation schemes to either improve cell titer during growth or to improve SL production itself, such as in-situ separation of sophorolipids. Selection criteria were produced using key performance factors identified from the literature, together with other factors such as available quantity, price and logistics as well as the potential for integrated biorefining. These selection criteria were then applied to the UK as a case study. In the future, the framework developed could be applied to feedstock assessment and selection for localized sophorolipid production in various locations around the world.}

With a prevalence of about one million d/Deaf and Hard of Hearing (HOH) patients that utilize American Sign Language (ASL) and the strong potential for communication barriers to adversely influence patient care outcomes, strategies must be developed to support health care professionals and students in learning to better care for d/Deaf and HOH patients. The primary objective of this project was to implement and assess a co-curricular course focused on helping student pharmacists become more confident and comfortable in communicating with d/Deaf and HOH patients.
Educational activity and setting
The co-curricular course (ASL for the Pharmacy Professional) consisted of four 90-min classes, each covering different words/phrases and Deaf cultural competence. Students were taught basic ASL including the alphabet, numbers, vocabulary, and sentence structure. Deaf culture and d/Deaf patient interaction was also covered. Students interacted with a Deaf physician over Skype and with d/Deaf and HOH individuals from the local community.
Findings
Pre- and post-surveys that contained an identical set of questions were administered before and after course completion. Surveys assessed confidence and level of comfort of first- and second-professional year student pharmacists surrounding Deaf culture and interacting with d/Deaf and HOH patients. Following the course, students reported significantly improved confidence in communicating with d/Deaf patients directly and with a translator.
Summary
Following completion of a co-curricular ASL course, doctor of pharmacy students perceived an increase in confidence in working with d/Deaf and HOH patients. Program logistics were simplified through collaboration with an outside entity.}

abstract = {Krypton-85 and other radioactive noble gases are widely used for groundwater dating purposes. 85Kr analysis require large volumes of water to reach the analytical requirements. Conventionally, this water is pumped to the surface to be degassed with a gas extraction system. The large pumping rate may disturb the natural flow field and requires substantial field logistics. Hence, we propose a new in-situ degassing method, in which membrane contactors are used to degas the groundwater directly in the well and gas is collected at the surface. This way, field work is facilitated, groundwater system disturbance is minimized, and the gas sample is collected at a specific depth. We demonstrate the tightness of the system regarding atmospheric air contamination for a collection times of 24 h, which is sufficient for both low-level counting and laser-based counting methods for 85Kr. The minimal borehole diameter is 7.5 cm for the prototype presented in this research but can easily be reduced to smaller diameters. In a case study, we compare the results obtained with the new passive method with those from a conventional packer setup sampling. Additionally, 3H/3He samples were collected for both sampling regimes and the dating results were compared with those from 85Kr. A good agreement between tracer ages is demonstrated and the age stratigraphy is consistent with the expected age distribution for a porous unconfined aquifer. In addition, our study emphasizes the differences between the age information sampled with various methods. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the new in situ quasi-passive method provides a more representative age stratigraphy with depth in most cases.}

The IRP is a broad class of hard to solve problems with numerous practical applications in the field of freight transportation and logistics. A supplier is responsible for determining the timing and the quantity of replenishment services offered to a set of customers over a multi-period time horizon. In addition, vehicle routes have to be defined jointly with the inventory related decisions. A novel two-commodity flow formulation is introduced together with a new set of valid inequalities. On this basis, a branch-and-cut algorithm that employs methods for separating various families of cuts is proposed. Extensive computational experiments are reported on well-established benchmark data sets. The proposed solution approach outmatches results of current state-of-the-art branch-and-cut, branch-and-price, metaheuristic and mathematical programming based heuristic approaches, especially for hard-to-solve instances. Notably, we report 116 new upper bounds out of 640 problems of a well-known benchmark data set. Moreover, for the first time, we present new lower and upper bounds for the same data set with a larger number of vehicles. Finally, we improve 139 upper bounds out of 200 hard-to-solve larger problems of the IRP literature.}

Based on the technological paradigm, this paper proposes a closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) that integrates forward and reverse logistics and has multiple centers that regulate end-of-life CDW recycling and promote new product remanufacturing. Carbon price (CP) and carbon trading (CT) policies are then innovatively applied to manage the proposed supply chain, incentivize technological CDW disposal improvements, encourage policy adherence, and ensure that the economic and environmental benefits are built into the proposed CLSC. A mixed integer nonlinear programming model (MINLP) is developed to optimize the proposed CLSC by minimizing the total costs under the two carbon policies, and a real case study from China is given. Scenario analyses under the two carbon polices and practical policy suggestions are given, and comprehensive conclusions are provided in the conclusions. It was found that with the adjustment of recycling ratio, the proposed CDW CLSC was able to minimize total costs and overall carbon emissions. Moreover, the CP policy could improve the CDW recycling ratio from 19.4% to 85.3% and reduced carbon emissions by 6393 tonnes, and the CT policy should be an incentive policy to further encourage a higher recycling ratio and lower carbon emissions.}

Among operations, many state-of-the-art parts-to-picker robots are introduced to help human workers to improve their pick-to-light operation efficiency. However, at present the human decision approaches that take physical and mental aspects into consideration in an AI-oriented order-picking warehouse are rare. Therefore, how to design an order picking decision for the pick-to-light strategy interacting with the robot has become one important factor in the warehouse. The aim of this paper is to propose an efficient procedure based on the fuzzy set theory to solve the pick-to-light planning problem with parts-to-picker robots in the AI-oriented computer aided picking system (CAPS). Apart from traditional picking strategies that pursue time-reduction performance for orders, fuzzy set approaches provide proper mechanism for reflecting the human physical and mental loading to determine the picking sequences when robots arrive. A pick-to-light strategy that analyzes mutual behavior and operation relations of human and robots is presented here. The objective aimed to achieve is to reduce picking flow time under acceptable human physical and mental loading for the order fulfillment. An empirical example is to illustrate the solution procedure and validate the proposed method that is capable of improving productivity and ergonomic quality simultaneously for pick-to-light operations.}

Corticosteroid injections are used in the conservative treatment of Flexor hallucis longus (FHL) tendinopathy. Studies for imaging guided injection are done, however, the accuracy of blind injection has not yet been studied.
Purpose
The aim of this study was to determine the accuracy of a blind injection technique into the FHL tendon sheath.
Hypothesis
We hypothesize that a blind injections technique into the FHL tendon sheath based on clinical examination has a high accuracy.
Study design
Descriptive cadaveric study.
Methods
Ten ankles of human cadavers were blindly injected with radiologic contrast mixed with methylene blue into the FHL tendon sheath. After injection, a CT scan of each ankle was performed to evaluate the location of contrast material. CT scans were reviewed by an experienced musculoskeletal radiologist blinded to the procedure. Anatomic dissection was undertaken to assess the location of the injection fluid.
Results
In nine ankles the radiological contrast was injected in the FHL tendon sheath. In one cadaver there was a technical problem and was therefore excluded.
Conclusion
This study shows that the FHL tendon sheath can be blindly injected based on only clinical examination with high accuracy. Level of evidence: Descriptive cadaveric study.}

abstract = {Purpose
Sex education programs need to modify their focus in light of changing societal norms and increasing exposure to pornography. This study investigates what adolescents want to know about the sexuality of the opposite sex. This will allow practitioners to adjust sex education curricula to the needs of adolescents, thereby supporting the establishment of healthy, respectful, and sexually fulfilling relationships.
Methods
Two thousand three hundred forty-three adolescents from the age of 11–19 years (123 classes) were asked to formulate questions addressed to the opposite sex as part of peer-led sex education classes, where girls and boys were divided into separate groups. Groups of 10–12 individuals each formulated about 11 questions, resulting in a total of 2,625 questions. The questions were categorized using content analysis.
Results
The largest portion of questions addressed sexual interaction (35.8%), with many questions further addressing sexual preference (e.g., oral sex, sex positions) and the logistics and qualitative aspects of first-time sexual intercourse. Adolescents were also interested in questions about the body (e.g., anatomy, body hair, 15.2%), relationships (e.g., love, dating, 13.9%), ideal characteristics of men/women (10.5%), masturbation (10.1%), and pornography (7.3%).
Conclusion
Adolescents show a high degree of interest in understanding the feelings and perceptions of the opposite sex. Acquiring this knowledge could be beneficial in building emotionally and physically fulfilling relationships. To increase adolescents' sexual and relationship competence, sexual education curricula should encompass pleasure and desire aspects of sexuality, initiating and managing relationships, societal ideals, and addressing pornography, in addition to sexual and reproductive health knowledge.}

abstract = {Introduction
Obesity is currently not a medical indication for elective induction of labor although obese patients may not be eligible for expectant management after 41 W G. Few data on labor and complications in this population undergoing prolonged pregnancy are known. The objective of our study was to evaluate labor, mode of delivery, maternal and fetal outcomes in prolonged pregnancy in obese patients compared to normal body mass index (BMI).
Materials and methods
It was a retrospective cohort study in patients who, after prolonged pregnancy gave birth to a single fetus, in cephalic presentation, between the first of January 2002 and December 31, 2018 in the Caen University Hospital Center. Patient’s characteristics were compared within each BMI class using uni- and multivariate analysis with regression logistics models.
Results
Overall, 9159 patients were included. Term of birth and spontaneous labor calculated rates were significantly increased in case of obesity (p < 0.001). The adjusted Odds Ratio (ORa) for induced labor in class III obesity was 1.73 [1.13−2.66]. After induction of labor, 83.0 % patients with normal BMI delivered vaginally versus 61.8 % in case of class III obesity (p < 0.001). The ORa for an emergency cesarean was 3.39 [2.04–5.63] and 1.78 [1.06−2.99] for neonatal morbidity in class III obesity.
Conclusion
Morbid obese patients do not belong to a low risk patient’s group when pregnancy is prolonged. Elective induction in case of morbid obesity may entail less risk than allowing the pregnancy to progress after 41 W G or even 39 W G. Further randomized prospective studies are nevertheless required.}

A comprehensive, well-trained pediatric workforce is needed to ensure high-quality child health interventions around the globe. Further understanding of pediatric workforce training capacity would assist planning at the global and country level. The purpose of this study was to better understand the availability and process of training programs for pediatricians and pediatric subspecialists worldwide, as well as in-country presence of subspecialists.
Methods
A survey was developed and distributed by e-mail to national pediatric leaders across the globe. The survey asked about the number of pediatric training programs, duration and logistics of training, and whether practicing pediatric subspecialists and subspecialty training programs were available in their country.
Results
We received responses from 121 of the 166 countries contacted (73%). Of these, 108 countries reported the presence of one or more general pediatric postgraduate training programs, ranging from 1 to 500 programs per country. The number of training programs did not vary significantly by gross domestic product but did vary by region, with the fewest in Africa (P < .001). Most countries identified national guidelines for training (82% of countries) and accreditation (84% of countries). Availability of pediatric subspecialists varied significantly by income and region, from no subspecialties available in 4 countries to all 26 queried subspecialties available in 17 countries. Neonatology was most common, available in 88% of countries. Subspecialty training programs were less available overall, significantly correlating with country income.
Conclusion
Education for general pediatrics and pediatric subspecialties is quite limited in many of the countries surveyed, particularly in Africa. The creation of additional educational capacity is a critical issue challenging the adequate provision of pediatrics and pediatric subspecialty services.}

abstract = {Bridges are crucial points of connection in the transport system, underpinning economic vitality, social well-being and logistics of modern communities. Bridges have also strategic relevance, since they support access to emergency services (e.g. hospitals) and utilities (e.g. water supplies). Bridges are mostly exposed to natural hazards, in particular riverine bridges to flooding, and disruption could lead to widespread negative effects. Therefore, protecting bridges enhances the resilience of cities and communities. Currently, most of the countries are not able to identify bridges at higher risk of failure, due to the unavailability of high-quality data, the mix ownership of the assets or the lack of a risk-based assessment. This paper introduces a risk-based approach to bridge management, alongside the gaps of current methodologies. Then, it presents a preliminary protocolled taxonomy for data collection of riverine bridges in flood-prone areas, while illustrating the implication of a national bridge inventory in the UK. This paper advocates the engagement of national authorities for developing a roadmap of policies leading to a unified bridge database functional for strategic risk assessment.}
