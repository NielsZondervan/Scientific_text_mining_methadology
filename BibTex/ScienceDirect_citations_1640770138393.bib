abstract = {Introduction
It is common knowledge that mobility refers to a distinct vector for pathogens, but the importance of prevention and the infusion of public health practices within transportation systems is not manifest. Replication studies of this effect are important because transportation remains veiled in modern societies, since its demand is not direct, but derived.
Methods
Variables mirroring transportation and logistics' systems intensity (trade data, the logistics performance index, and investment in transportation) are cross-tabulated with epidemiological data from the recent coronavirus pandemic. As the samples of the data pertain to a dependent commonality, the statistical hypothesis test applicable is McNemar's test. In addition, the statistical power of the test(s) is calculated as a marker of methodological validity and reliability. To further strengthen the analytical methodology, a plethora of descriptive statistics have been calculated and multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) has been conducted.
Results
This work confirms that the domain of transportation bears a strong association with not only mortality of a disease, but its recovery rates as well. All crosstabs provide statistically significant results and the statistical power calculated is very high, signifying the appropriateness of the methodology and the very low probability of Type II error. The MCA results are significant, as well.
Conclusions
The impact, or even the presence of transportation is veiled, as transportation comprises of derived demand dynamics. As such, its activities and even the prerequisites for its efficient operations many times go unnoticed. This work replicates a known effect, that mobility exacerbates the presence of a pathogen. The significance of this research lies on the fact that distinct indicators that reflect transportation and logistics are (though a robust calculatory methodology) statistically associated with epidemiological data.}

This paper suggests a holistic approach to assess transformation potential of the supply chain and logistics sector towards more sustainable economic systems while defining innovative business strategies to meet future macroeconomic developments. This is achieved through an integrated assessment of production and consumption systems, considering the interests of the key stakeholders. Moreover, the paper combines advanced methods to develop future macroeconomic scenarios and to assess the strategic business opportunities of the supply chain and logistics sector addressing societal developments, e.g. new consumption patterns. The analysis relies on modern theories of Environmental and Ecological Economics, contributing to transformation theories.

Utilising an inductive approach, the purpose of this study was to examine the processes and decisions parents make in the context of youth sport tourism to facilitate their children's travel sport participation. In-depth interviews were conducted with youth sport parents from the two US states with significant investments in sport tourism: Indiana and Florida. (n = 15 FL; n = 18 IN). Three themes were identified in the parents' narratives using grounded theory methods, (1) Travel Logistics, (2) Flow-on Tourism, and (3) Tourn-acations. Travel logistics were dominated by decisions over accommodations and transportation with price and team bonding of consideration. A series of barriers and enablers to participation in flow-on tourism were identified including tournament schedules and proximity to tourist attractions. Decisions to create a mini-vacation out of the tournament trip (tourn-acation) were associated with novelty, distance from home, and timing such as tournaments scheduled around national holidays. A model outlining the family travel decision-making process in the context of youth sport tourism is proffered. Recommendations for DMOs leveraging the flow-on tourism associated with youth sport-events are discussed in addition to acknowledging the role of youth sport tourism in post Covid-19 tourism recovery.}

abstract = {Summary
Objectives
Many signs point to the growing importance of drug shortages in Canada and around the world. Although drug shortages affect clinicians and patients every day, there is a paucity of literature describing the specific problems experienced and their clinical consequences. To describe the drug shortage situation in Canada in 2016–2017 and to discuss this issue in the Canadian context.
Methods
This retrospective study was based on data from one Canadian wholesaler (McKesson Canada) and the official Drug Shortages Canada website.
Results
From August 31, 2016, to September 4, 2017, the McKesson database showed 583 drug shortages, averaging 160 (standard deviation [SD] 180) days, and the drug shortage website showed 2,129 shortages, averaging 118 (SD 113) days. Of these shortages, 26% in the McKesson database and 14% at the official drug shortage website were for parenteral products. In both the McKesson database and the Canadian drug shortage database, the leading drug classes with shortages were central nervous system drugs (26.4% and 31.8%, respectively), cardiovascular drugs (12.0% and 21.9%), anti-infective agents (11.2% and 8.5%), gastrointestinal drugs (7.9% and 6.2%) and antineoplastic agents (7.4% and 5.1%).
Conclusions
This descriptive study highlights the high number of shortages in Canada in 2016–2017. The new federal regulation requiring declaration of drug shortages should lead to better monitoring of this problem at the national level. Although the causes of shortages are often identified, manufacturers and regulators are frequently unable to address or effectively prevent drug shortages.
Résumé
Objectifs
De nombreux signes témoignent de l’importance croissante des ruptures de médicaments au Canada et ailleurs dans le monde. Bien que les ruptures affectent quotidiennement les cliniciens et les patients, il existe encore trop peu de littérature décrivant cette problématique et leurs conséquences cliniques. L’objectif est de décrire la situation relative aux ruptures au Canada en 2016–2017 et de discuter de cette problématique dans le contexte canadien.
Méthodes
Il s’agit d’une étude descriptive rétrospective fondée sur les données d’un grossiste canadien (McKesson Canada) et du site officiel canadien de déclaration des ruptures.
Résultats
Du 31 août 2016 au 4 septembre 2017, on dénombre 583 médicaments en rupture chez McKesson (160±180jours en moyenne), et 2129 sur le site canadien (118±113jours en moyenne). Parmi ces ruptures, 26 % chez McKesson et 14 % sur le site canadien sont des médicaments administrés par voie parentérale. Les principales classes thérapeutiques de médicaments en rupture chez McKesson et sur le site canadien sont les médicaments du système nerveux central (26,4 % et 31,8 %), cardiovasculaires (12,0 % et 21,9 %), les anti-infectieux (11,2 % et 8,5 %), les médicaments gastro-intestinaux (7,9 % et 6,2 %) et les antinéoplasiques (7,4 % et 5,1 %).
Conclusion
Cette étude met en évidence un nombre élevé de ruptures au Canada en 2016–2017. La nouvelle réglementation sur l’obligation de déclaration des ruptures de médicaments permettra probablement un meilleur suivi de cette problématique à l’échelle nationale. Bien que les causes de ruptures soient souvent identifiées, les fabricants et les autorités réglementaires sont encore trop souvent impuissants pour lutter et prévenir efficacement les ruptures de médicaments.}

Most prominent potential advantages of drone delivery are cost savings, high speed, and high flexibility. Additionally, drones are also considered as a means of green transportation as they are electric vehicles which are potentially emission-free. To which extent these claimed potentials exist depends on the application scenario as well as the environmental and technological conditions. In this study a stationary drone delivery system is considered where parcels are delivered from a central depot to customers either by drone or electric truck. The minimal total energy consumption for serving all customers is determined when using only an electric truck or a mixed fleet of electric trucks and drones. In a simulation study the effects of structural characteristics (like numbers of customers and customer density) and environmental conditions (like wind speed and traffic conditions) on potential energy savings using drones are estimated. The results indicate that structural characteristics and environmental conditions heavily affect the energy saving potential of drones. In urban settings with high customer density, the energy saving potential is limited to at most 1% while in rural settings drones can help to save 5% of total energy. Under drone-favoring conditions like calm winds and heavy traffic, the energy saving potential can double.}

It reveals that, in addition to the well-known differences such as specific manufacturer-supplier relationships or production strategies, the organization of logistics itself constitutes a basis for persistent variations. Car manufacturers operating at a global scale are facing uncertainties in matching supply and demand, thus increasingly requiring flexibility. This flexibility is notably achieved through varying combinations of local and distant sourcing to respond to changes in market conditions, currency exchange rates, and so on. To limit the costs of distant sourcing, car manufacturers use parts consolidation centers, which are cross-docking facilities where parts are sorted and packed in sea containers depending on their final destination. Findings show that, beyond its generic purpose, the parts consolidation centers play different roles within the logistics organization of the two focal firms. In one case, they are highly integrated within the global production system; in the other, they are simply used as transfer points. These different models of utilization of parts consolidation centers imply significantly different relationships with parts’ suppliers, and point to wider differences in the overall logistics systems.}

abstract = {We study a realistic capacitated multimodal transportation planning problem (CMTPP) faced by logistics companies when trying to obtain a cost advantage in a competitive market. This problem simultaneously considers limited vehicle numbers and order consolidation. Given a set of origin–destination transportation orders with a time window, solving the CMTPP involves determining the delivery paths of these orders on a capacitated network as well as selecting the transportation modes used on these paths. Without violating time windows and network capacity constraints, all customers’ requests must be satisfied exactly, with minimum overall logistics costs. The CMTPP is formulated as a mixed binary linear program based on which an effective kernel search and dynamic programming hybrid heuristic (HKSDP) is proposed, which repeatedly generates feasible solutions. A column generation approach is also proposed to provide a lower bound for the problem which is then used to evaluate the performance of the proposed heuristics. Numerical experiments for various sizes of random instances (with at most 300 orders in a network and 20 nodes) are conducted. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of column generation in obtaining a tight lower bound as well as the efficiency of the HKSDP in achieving a high-quality near-optimal solution. The average optimality gap is approximately 1.04%. We also provide a practical application of the proposed HKSDP to a logistics network in inland China.}

To improve the economy of logistics and ensure the quality of fruits and vegetables in refrigerated transportation, a multi-temperature insulation box with different phase change materials (PCMs) was designed for cold storage in this work. The efficiency of PCMs was evaluated using a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and thermal conductivity tester. The experimental results reveal phase transition temperatures of 7.1 and −2.5 °C, latent heats of 146.1 and 256.2 J/g, and thermal conductivities of 0.2832 and 0.9427 W/(m·K) of PCM1 (n-octanoic acid-myristic acid composite) and PCM2 (potassium sorbate-water composite), respectively. Combined with vacuum insulation technology, a multi-temperature zone insulation box for cold storage was constructed. A three-dimensional unsteady model was established, and the temperature and velocity fields in different parts of the box were analyzed, especially the melting process of PCMs. An insulation box temperature test system was established using good supply practice (GSP). The experimental results reveal that temperature zones 2 (medium zone) and 3 (low zone) of the insulation box can be kept cold at 7–9 °C for about 13 h and at −2–0 °C for about 14 h, respectively. The results suggest that the designed multi-temperature storage insulation box is an effective transportation equipment for cold chain logistics.}

The detailed coordinates of the subzones (longitude and latitude) are provided in the article. The daily ice thickness for the period between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2016 has been obtained for each of the 12.5km sided squares. This data article provides the normality test outcomes and the corresponding p-value of the ice thickness data for each subzone on each calendar day. Moreover, the mean and the standard deviation of the ice thickness in each subzone are also provided. The data provided in this data article can be very helpful for researchers for different applications related to the weather conditions in the NSR zone or to shipping related issues. For instance, the data provided in this paper can be used to investigate the change in ice thickness in the NSR over the period 2006–2016 and to estimate future changes. Another potential application is the estimation of the need for icebreaker assistance as well as the possible ranges for the vessel sailing speed based on the vessel type and for any navigation day in any of the NSR zones. In addition, this data can be used to estimate the risk of blockage for any vessel type because of ice conditions in the NSR zones. It can be helpful to estimate the economic viability of shipping through the NSR since the icebreaker assistance, the speed and the risk of blockage have an effect on the profitability of the shipping lines that may use the NSR.}

To guarantee the energy efficiency, the impacts of customer service modes and recharging strategies need to be integrated into the optimization of electric logistics resource. This paper proposes an electric vehicle routing problem with mixed backhauls, time windows, and recharging strategies (EVRPMBTW-RS), minimizing the total travel cost with sophisticated constraints on the time-dependent pickup and delivery requests, limited recharging station capacity, and battery remaining capacity of electric vehicles. Mixed service sequences of linehaul and backhaul customers is allocated for the routing planning, with the synchronous optimization of recharging strategies including the selection of recharging stations and determination of recharging time. A time-discretized multi-commodity network flow model is constructed based on an extended space–time-state modeling framework, which is formulated as a quadratic 0–1 programming model by using the augmented Lagrangian relaxation technique. After the dualization and linearized transformation, we decompose the model into a sequence of least-cost path subproblems based on the alternating direction multiplier method (ADMM). The subproblems are alternately minimized and solved using the time-dependent forward dynamic programming algorithm. The solution quality can be guaranteed through calculating the optimality gap between the best lower bound and upper bound for each iteration. The proposed solution approach is examined on examples of a simple 7-node network and real-world Yizhuang road network. This paper provides a theoretical foundation for the route optimization method of electric logistics vehicles, and contributes to improve the operational efficiency of electric logistics systems.}

This paper deals with a specific network flow problem where the mixed municipal waste as a secondary and partly renewable energy carrier is transported from waste producers (municipalities), through pre-processing facilities, to its final treatment in waste processing units and in which the optimal flow is desired. The results obtained for the minimum total costs, including treatment and transportation, correspond to production and savings of a certain amount of CO2 and other greenhouse gases which is described by Global Warming Potential (GWP). The average cost was 74 EUR/t and average GWP was 37 kg CO2eq/t. The GWP contribution varies among the waste producers as a result of treating waste in different places and various technologies. However, to identify the individual contributions, the detailed waste flow identification is required. The flow distribution is unknown due to the effect of merging and splitting waste streams in the network. For this reason, a consequent network flow problem for exact waste flows identification is proposed. The model follows the principle ideas of multi-commodity network flow modelling and it reveals the variability of cost and GWP contribution for all producers in the investigated area. The proposed method has been tested through a case study considering treatment of mixed municipal waste. The results obtained by the original implementation in GAMS are presented and discussed in detail. The GWP contribution varied between −173 and 880 kg CO2eq/t and significant waste producers were identified in the network regarding GWP. The results are important for setting the target for emission reduction in individual regions and for particular producers. The principle can be applied in general to any commodity and network flow problem.}

However, what happens when shelters themselves are damaged and unable to serve those people? An open question with key policy implications is: How can we identify the most critical shelter(s) as a part of broader emergency evacuation operations and how can we respond to an interdiction? This paper develops a two-step modeling framework consisting of enhanced r-interdiction median models (RIM) to identify the most significant shelter(s) and revised p-median models to identify shelters to repurpose during such an interdiction where shelters are rendered off-line. Proposed models are applied on a Southeast Florida case study with respect to scenarios based on varying hurricane strength and shelter demand. Findings indicate that models are susceptible to travel cost variation based on the demand-weighted objectives, and that shelter selections vary due to different demand scenarios created which focus on different population segments. As hurricane strength increases, critical shelter identification is driven by flooding and storm surge risks. These findings can inform efforts to harden those critical shelters so that they can better serve populations in need.}

Increasingly, platforms emerge as facilitators for this kind of collaborative transportation. However, individual actors connected to a platform might refuse to share (parts of) their information due to reasons of competition. Though the need for realistic information sharing models is widely acknowledged by transportation researchers and practitioners, the precise value of such information is mostly unknown. We investigate the quality of solutions that can be obtained when different types and levels of carrier data are available. We consider an auction-based Multi-Agent System to solve large-scale, dynamic pickup and delivery problems, and vary whether carriers’ positions or route plans are available, and whether carriers are fully cooperative or more competitive in placing their bids by sharing or hiding their marginal costs. In total, we evaluate 9 different information sharing policies. The availability of vehicle position and route plan information turns out to be important for decreasing total route costs, and sharing marginal costs has a positive impact on service level. We provide detailed insights into trade-offs of carriers’ confidentiality concerns and a range of system performance objectives (service level, travel costs, and carrier profits) under different circumstances (various numbers of auctions, penalties for rejected orders, emission or congestion fees, and different problem characteristics). Based on these results, platform providers can stimulate sharing of certain information to improve the total system efficiency.}

Countries where the economy is driven by global trade, either as exporters or importers and are faced with the problem of declining imports and exports. This is due to the interruption of the main players of the global supply chain (i.e., production, logistics and transportation sector) as well as the slow-down in consumption of overseas customers. This paper presents the development of an efficiency related metric from the Coherent Data Envelopment Analysis (CoDEA) method for assessing the vulnerability (or conversely, the robustness) levels of the supply chain system of six ASEAN countries. The results reveal that Thailand is most vulnerable to international supply chain issues indicated by its lowest efficiency score. This is due to Thailand's severe disruption of logistics and transportation systems compared with its neighboring countries. In contrast, Vietnam is the most robust because of its efficiency in the exports sector. Our research reveals that trading partners with a lower risk and the ability to rapidly recover their import volume reflect their less vulnerable supply chains. This research provides the associated strategies to establish a resilient global supply chain in spite of the COVID-19 pandemic.}

abstract = {A joint distribution system based on digital connectivity to share logistics resources constitutes an innovative method of intelligent logistics. In general, O2O deliverymen are subjected to delivery capacity imbalances in different hours—peak hours and off-peak hours in particular—throughout the day. To solve the insufficient capacity problem in peak hours and the idle capacity problem in off-peak hours of O2O deliverymen, this paper introduces an innovative digital connectivity enabled B2C and O2O joint distribution system. In this system, all pickup and delivery nodes of both B2C and O2O orders are interconnected through the Physical Internet. In response to the dynamic arrivals of O2O orders, this paper develops a center dispatching system to collect and schedule the real-time logistics information via digital connectivity. An improved savings algorithm is proposed to support the real-time routing optimization of deliverymen. By making a comparative analysis with the traditional separate distribution mode, this paper proves the effectiveness of the joint distribution system. Results show that it outputs better optimization with larger order sizes, the same B2C and O2O order proportions as well as longer lengths of O2O time window. With the benefit of the digital connectivity, the joint distribution system contributes to providing real-time logistics services with high efficiency and reducing carbon emissions to realize sustainability. The prospect of this system exhibits the potential for use in richly varied delivery services, most notably meal delivery in urban areas.}

Moreover, as collaborations in logistics between several companies become popular, more flexible and extended models must be solved to consider the different needs of the companies. This is of high importance in a new logistics concept, the Physical Internet, which is expected to considerably improve the way logistics are handled in the current supply chain management. To optimise the aforementioned requirements, a rich vehicle routing problem with pickup and delivery including numerous attributes is modelled and solved. A mathematical formulation is proposed and implemented in CPLEX to solve the problem. Given the complexity of the problem, solving large instances with exact methods is very time-consuming. Therefore, a multi-threaded meta-heuristic based on Simulated Annealing is developed. A set of new operators coupled with a restart strategy and memory are developed to help improve the performance. Computational results on a generated data-set showed that the proposed meta-heuristic is superior to the CPLEX solver in terms of solvability and computational time. The proposed meta-heuristic was also compared with the best-known results by current state-of-the-art methods on a classical benchmark on pickup and delivery problems with time windows (with up to 200 customers). The experimental results showed that the proposed method was able to match the best-known results in many of these large scale instances}

Our proposed optimization model considers two interacting networks - the network that moves evacuees from the location of the event out of the Arctic (e.g., a large city in Alaska such as Anchorage) and the logistics network that moves relief materials to evacuees during the operations. We model the concept of deprivation costs by incorporating priority levels capturing the severeness of evacuees’ current medical situation and the period indicating the amount of time an evacuee has not received key relief resources. Our model is capable of understanding the best possible response given the current locations of response resources and is used to assess the effectiveness of an intuitive heuristic that mimics emergency response decision-making.}

abstract = {Collaboration among logistics operators offers an effective way to improve customer service and freight transportation efficiency. One form of collaboration is the sharing of logistics resources (e.g., delivery vehicles). Existing studies on collaboration and resource sharing have not sufficiently accounted for the time frame within which collaboration happens, and they mostly assume that collaboration among logistics operators occurs in a single time period. This study addresses the issue of collaboration across multiple time periods, in which logistics resources can be shared between different service time periods, by formulating and solving a two-echelon collaborative multi-depot multi-period vehicle routing problem (2E-CMDPVRP). The 2E-CMDPVRP is formulated as a multi-objective integer programming model that minimizes logistics operational costs, service waiting times, and number of vehicles in multiple service periods. A hybrid heuristic algorithm with three-dimensional k-means clustering and improved reference point-based non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-III (IR-NSGA-III) is proposed to solve the multi-objective optimization model. Comparative analysis results show that the proposed IR-NSGA-III outperforms existing algorithms in terms of the minimization of logistics operational costs, service waiting times, and number of vehicles. The minimum costs remaining saving method and strictly monotonic path selection principle are combined to determine the best profit allocation schemes and the optimal coalition sequences. An empirical case study of a multi-depot multi-period logistics network in Chongqing, China, is used to validate the proposed model and solution algorithm. Results suggest that the proposed collaborative mechanism with multi-depot and multi-period resource sharing can improve the degree of synchronization within a collaborative logistics network, and thus contribute to sustainable development of urban logistics distribution networks.}

Although precautionary strategies are implemented to protect critical assets in the digital logistics network, a high-level adversary can still penetrate the network and launch attacks inside the organisation. Thus, real-time recovery plays an important role in facing real-time cyberattacks. This paper proposes a novel max-min integer programming model subject to a budget constraint to improve network connectivity of a compromised digital logistics network via a strategy of maximising algebraic connectivity. Due to the NP-hardness of the maximisation problem, the optimal solution may not be found quickly. Thus, several heuristic algorithms, including greedy algorithms, tabu search and relaxed semidefinite programming (SDP) with rounding, are proposed. Verification of these heuristic algorithms is achieved by applying them, firstly to a hypothetical network, then to a large scale-free network which mimics a digital logistics network.}

In particular, this study tested whether the distribution of measured innovation efficiency value differs in terms of the degree of consideration of higher education institutes and research and development (R & D) institutes as sources of information. To investigate the innovation efficiency of Korean logistics firms, we used a combined method of the input-oriented data envelopment analysis (DEA) with constant return to scale and Kruskal Wallis one-way ANOVA (analysis of variance) techniques. The findings in the study suggest that the logistics firms in Korea tend not to seriously consider higher education institutes and R & D institutes as crucial sources of information for achieving their logistics innovation.

Thus, environmental considerations during the planning, designing, implementation, and controlling of business activities in the entire supply chain have taken more attention in recent years. Therefore, many studies have been performed considering the greenness of different activities within supply chains. Greenness assessment of supply chains is one of the most critical and essential subjects of the related literature. The companies can learn their weak sides and provide the required amendments to improve their supply chains' greenness as a result of the assessment. Hence, in this study, a greenness assessment methodology is proposed for four logistics stages including in-bound, in-plant, out-bound, and reverse logistics. By investigating the greenness of different logistics stages separately, their characteristics can be analyzed in a more systematic way. Also, a detailed KPI determination process is realized, and a comprehensive KPI set is proposed for all the logistics stages for the first time in the literature. Moreover, as another novelty, a methodology based on intuitionistic fuzzy-based techniques, an integrated IF-DEMATEL and IF-ANP approach, is utilized for the greenness assessment. The related steps of the developed methodology are explicitly provided within the study, an application is realized for a company, and results are analyzed in a detailed way.}

Primary data are all real data from a recycling unit in Minas Gerais State, Brazil – a highlight of this work; secondary data were given from the literature and LCA databases. The environmental impact indicators evaluated were: Global Warming Potential (GWP), Abiotic Resource Depletion (ARD), Terrestrial Acidification, Water Scarcity, Ozone Depletion Potential and Freshwater Ecotoxicity. Methodologies recommended for the Brazilian context were used for the impact assessment. A comparison between B2B and B2F was done: in five of the seven categories evaluated, B2F had a greater environmental potential impact; however, both show a lower impact than virgin PET. Related to similar products, results were compared with those of studies for other regions, for GWP and ARD, fossil, transportation characteristics such as average distance and load, resulting in impacts of the same order except when only transportation is analyzed. Environmental hotspots were related to diesel consumption in bottle logistics, and to the consumption of natural gas and electricity in industrial recycling processes. Improvement opportunities were identified, and proposals were discussed. The impact on changing bottle logistics was achieved by resizing PET-bottle bales, using more appropriate vehicles, and adopting transport distances compatible with international practice.}

Such companies operate in different geographical markets and use different rolling stock. The article considers the problem of investments in vehicles with a given structure of served cargo flows. Investment projects in network logistics companies are characterized by many options for promising technology for using various vehicles. The main goal when choosing a solution is to optimize investments in the face of restrictions on material and financial resources, productivity, commercial and technological suitability of rolling stock. An optimization model of choosing the structure of investments in the transport park under various conditions and freight flows is presented. The model is a graph, along the arcs of which is a bankroll. Each unit of cash flow corresponds to two parameters - the freight carried and the income received. An original interpretation of the indicated parameters is given in order to formalize the technological parameters of transport in the functionality and limitations. The model can set transportation plans for regions and modes of transport, as well as restrictions on cash flows, technical and commercial suitability of rolling stock. The criterion is the maximum income when fulfilling the restrictions. The model is implemented for three regional divisions of a logistics company and three types of relatively interchangeable types of transport units - covered wagons, containers and cars. The results are presented.}

Recently, hospitals start to recognize the importance of these logistics initiatives to improve their operational performance while also maintaining high quality of patient care. Patient care processes are supported by a range of supply chain activities including inventory management and distribution of medical supplies to point-of-care locations. At the operating room for instance, the logistics staff’s goal is managing materials and information flows to have the requested materials at the right operating room at the right time, in the most efficient way. However, poor inventory management, lack of standardization and lack of coordination between departments complicate healthcare logistics processes, and hence result in many waste. Opportunities for efficiency gains in these logistics processes can be identified by measuring the performance of the internal supply chain. This paper presents a rigorously defined logistics performance measurement framework to evaluate the efficiency of logistics processes in operating rooms. The Analytic Network Process (ANP) is utilized as a popular Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) technique to provide effective decision-support models. The proposed ANP-based framework is a first step towards measuring the performance of operating room supply chain processes by selecting and prioritizing logistics objectives and associated Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Further research is required to validate the ANP framework by including multiple stakeholders’ preferences, as they may have conflicting views on performance definitions. The final goal of the framework is to support hospital logistics managers in making transparent and informed decisions to improve inventory and distribution policies in the operating room while considering all stakeholders’ preferences.}

abstract = {Under 3PL financing service mode, we study the impact of 3PL’s transportation fee on the capital-constrained supply chain made up of a supplier, a capital-constrained retailer and a 3PL firm. In this paper, we assume that the 3PL firm can offer lower transportation fee to the retailer, if the retailer finances itself through the 3PL firm. First, we study the optimal operational strategies of the well-funded supply chain and the capital-constrained supply chain under 3PL financing service, respectively. In addition, we compare the optimal strategies and profits of supply chain enterprises under two cases, and also examine the impact of 3PL’s transportation fee on the performance of capital-constrained supply chain. Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulation, two important conclusions are drawn. First of all, when the 3PL firm offers variable transportation fee strategy, the retailer’s ordering quantity under 3PL financing service is more than that of a well-funded retailer if the transportation fee meets certain conditions. Otherwise the ordering quantity of a well-funded retailer is higher. Second, the variable transportation fee strategy of the 3PL firm cannot only increase the retailer’s profit and the 3PL’s profit, but also increase the total profit of the supply chain.}

The efficiency of management of these processes is significantly influenced by the forecast and planning of correspondence of cargo flows, distribution of resources. In the conditions of formation of the market of transport services, the transport and logistics system is affected by many of its subjects and objects, the uncertainty of demand for transport services, the lack of accountability of the external space factors and subjective perception of the internal environment. All this leads to imbalance in the rhythm of transport services provision and as a result affects their effectiveness. Quality process management requires optimization. Achieving a positive result of optimization is possible by forming transport and logistics management methods of transport services. The work investigates transport and logistic methods of transport services management. Principles of setting goals of strategic functions of the main transport and logistic process are considered, its invested periods are presented. The typology of criteria of efficiency of optimum management of correspondence flows in the segment of freight traffic and the main stages of optimization of this process are developed. Transport and logistics methods for determining the necessary criteria for planning and managing transport services are presented. Developed transport and logistics methods of management of transport services have found their application in one of the largest holdings of the world "Russian Railways" in the provision of technological complex transport services.}

Mixed Logit models and Decision Trees were used to analyze the data and their interactions. Order Fill Rate was found to be the most important attribute. Failure to satisfactorily fulfill the order at the moment of shopping can significantly compromise e-groceries. Some interactions among the variables, such as between order fill rate and delivery-service price, have also led to interesting conclusions that should be taken into account by the grocer when planning special offers. Short lead times do not seem to be a very important priority for regular e-grocery purchasing. This research approach combines two statistical methods to better understand consumer behavior concerning e-grocery, in addition to providing insights for grocery retailers on the importance of some attributes for the effectiveness of e-grocery and their consequences on business logistics, which are particularly challenging during pandemics.}

From the warning time to the landfall time, disaster planners receive updated information regarding the hurricane's trajectory and the potential target region iteratively. The planners should decide when the best trigger time (TT) is to start the preparedness activities (prepositioning stocks of emergency goods). The quality of a given TT is evaluated concerning two performance measures: (i) the total logistics cost in the preparedness and response phases; and (ii) the minimum response time (RT) needed to transfer goods from the response facilities to affected areas in the response phase. A stochastic optimization model is designed to determine the best TT, preparedness decisions, and response operations. The computational complexity of the model is reduced using a graph-theoretic conversion. We test the converted model on experimental data based on major hurricanes from 2001 to 2017 on the United States southeastern coast. Sensitivity analysis of the model shows that delaying TT makes a non-linear reduction in the total logistics cost and non-linear increment in the shortest possible RT. The optimal TT makes the best compromise between the total logistics cost and the speed of the response operations, according to the preference of disaster planners.}

The research focuses on large goods vehicles, capable of automated driving, where the driver is not required for some or all of the journey, for logistics operations between suppliers, manufacturing plant, and retailer. The data is collected through semi-structured interviews and scoring questionnaires. All 76 participants had experience working in the logistics industry, from various parts of the operations process. The data was analysed using thematic analysis followed with the results subsequently ranked by participants to identify the importance and perceived impact. Results revealed a near-term barrier for adoption of autonomous technology, is the lack of standardisation, as technology is progressing in many different directions, with little consultation on what features are needed or how they will be implemented. The findings show the main impact of commercialisation of autonomous road haulage are overall maintenance cost reduction, due to less wear and tear, and operational cost reduction, especially for long-haul journeys, as vehicles can operate for longer hours. Moreover, despite barriers in the short term, such as public acceptance and transition costs, these will likely be outweighed by improvements in efficiency and utilisation. Based on findings from the study, we present six key considerations for the introduction of commercial autonomous road haulage, which can be used as a guide for policy makers, insurance companies, transport planning authorities, and vehicle manufacturers.}

This study addresses a Closed-Loop Inventory Routing Problem under a mixed fleet of electric and conventional vehicles.

The proposed decision support models incorporate comprehensive estimation approaches for energy consumption of both electric and conventional vehicles that allow to better estimate fuel and electric cost and transportation emissions. The models respect uncertain reverse returnable transport items flow from customers as well. The numerical analyses demonstrate the benefits that could be obtained by means of the provided models. The Fix&Optimize heuristic yields in 5.72% lower costs within 59.23% shorter computation times on average compared to the Mixed-Integer Linear Programming model. The proposed models are capable to provide trade-off analyses for sustainable logistics management.}

The connection between I4.0 and CE is unveiled by addressing the case-based model affecting the economic and environmental performances imparting two important dimensions: (i) the information sharing with the reverse logistics system is in real-time mode, and (ii) diffusion of green product in the market. The effectiveness of the virtual world in I4.0 environment is explored using simulation of reverse logistics model involving operations such as inventory and production planning policy, family-based dispatching rules of remanufacturing, and additive manufacturing. The remanufacturing model examines the trade-off between set-up delays and the availability of green transportation. For managerial insights, Taguchi experimental design framework has been used for the analysis. Based on the trade-off analysis between environmental and economic performances, the findings of the paper suggest appropriate combinations of information-sharing and family-based dispatching rules. Further, the findings suggest that, given the I4.0 and circular capabilities, it is necessary to focus on the cost of the socially influenced operations involving factors such as collection investment and size of the end-user market that governs the product returns. Therefore, in the present paper, the integration of I4.0 and CE represents a real-time decision model for the sustainable reverse logistics system.}

Results show that stakeholders prefer a solution where OHD are jointly implemented together with one or more urban consolidation centres. This preliminary analysis paves the way for further technical/economic evaluations needed for OHD implementation in Rome. Stakeholders’ involvement is of outmost importance to understand their heterogeneous preferences and increase their awareness of urban freight transport problems, with the overall aim to foster behaviour change.}

The logistics of rostering in an airline requires that the figures estimated on fleet management and demand planning are set to the most accurate values. Many variables play a role; these values would be estimated values for the expected needs of the fleet management and the demands of planning. Crew availability can be described as a part of production but also distribution, and disposal logistics. Crews are the input of an airline company that distributes passengers or goods to a destination; contributing to an output for the company. The efficient use of crew members helps in logistics disposal; e.g., a refusal of a crew member to operate a flight due to fatigue can lead to flight disruption or even a flight cancellation, which will incur additional costs to the company. Scheduling processes with regards to crew member fatigue are furthermore regulated via Flight Time Limitations and Fatigue Risk Management Systems, however, the authors discuss the possibilities of fatigue mitigation through limiting the existing scheduling processes.}

Usually, deliveries take place at predetermined, constant time intervals. As in real-world MR systems, the number of containers to deliver in each interval varies in the short term, peaks in the number of deliveries may lead to capacity bottlenecks and late deliveries. In this paper, we develop three alternative strategies to determine starting times of MR cycles in real-time based on the current number of delivery orders in the system aiming to better handle variations in the number of orders. We evaluate the three strategies for different system load scenarios with respect to delivery service levels, order lead times, systems utilization and necessary number of MR trains using a discrete-event simulation model.}

In such an auction, a fourth party logistics (4PL) provider purchases transportation services from multiple third party logistics (3PL) providers. We develop a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer programming model that incorporates two features, including (i) a sustainable–responsive constraint to quantitatively describe the sustainability and responsiveness performance, and (ii) an effective hybrid mitigation strategy that combines the fortification policy with the temporary outsourcing service policy to mitigate disruptions. To determine winning 3PLs, a reduced scenario-based approximation approach is developed to solve the model and obtain a nearly optimal solution very quickly. Numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness and applicability of our model and method by using randomly generated instances as well as real data of a Chinese 4PL firm. Compared with existing studies, sensitivity analysis indicates that our proposed model can significantly reduce the 4PL’s expected cost and improve the long-term competitive advantages. Managerial implications are also drawn for 4PLs to run a sustainable–responsive logistics system under disruptions in a cost-effective way.}

abstract = {In late 2019 a new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emerged, causing a global pandemic within only a few weeks. A crucial factor in the public health response to pandemics is achieving a short turnaround time between a potential case becoming known, specimen collection and availability of a test result. In this article we address a logistics problem that arises in the context of testing potential cases. We assume that specimens can be collected in two ways: either by means of a mobile test-team or by means of a stationary test-team in a test-centre. After the specimens have been collected they must be delivered to a laboratory in order to be analysed. The problem we address aims at deciding how many test-centres to open and where, how many mobile test-teams to use, which suspected cases to assign to a test-centre and which to visit with a mobile test-team, which specimen to assign to which laboratory, and planning the routes of the mobile test-teams. The objective is to minimise the total cost of opening test-centres and routing mobile test-teams. We introduce this new problem, which we call the contagious disease testing problem (CDTP), and present a mixed-integer linear-programming formulation for it. We propose a large neighbourhood search metaheuristic for solving the CDTP and present an extensive computational study to illustrate its performance. Furthermore, we give managerial insights regarding COVID-19 test logistics, derived from problem instances based on real world data.}

On the basis of the main provisions of the theory of "growth poles" in the regional, federal and world economies, a proactive management of the development of the transport and logistics structure of the region is proposed taking into account the criteria of its effectiveness, which take into account not only the development of the transport and logistic infrastructure of the region, its socio-economic development, but also the development of transport and logistics infrastructure and the socio-economic development of the subjects adjacent to it. This will allow in the future, solving the problem of the spatial development of the transport and logistics infrastructure of the regions, to solve the problem of the spatial development of the Russian Federation. Analysis of the formation of demand for the use of international transport corridors passing through the region should be carried out taking into account the study of the transport and logistics needs of the regions based on the criteria for the effectiveness of the functioning of the national transport and logistics system. It was proposed to carry out research, planning, forecasting of transport and logistics needs of production, trade, transport and logistics organizations, customers and consumers of transport services, using the capabilities of the regional transport and logistic information system (RTLIS). RTLIS is an electronic information resource accumulating information related to transport and logistics operations carried out in the region or carried out through the region. The system includes various portals, including a portal for electronic placement of orders for transport and logistic services. In the study of transport and logistic needs, intra-regional and transit cargo flows, terminal complexes and warehouses, transport mobility of the population, attendance of public centers of gravity, places of work, study and service are investigated; single acts of transportation of goods by the population. In the study of transport services, enterprises that form and absorb cargo flows, the capabilities of terminal complexes, all types of public land vehicles, which form passenger traffic, personal travel by personal transport, and rolling stock capacity are considered. The development of methods for automated analysis of the formation of demand will make it possible to efficiently use the transport and logistic system of the region, increase the efficiency of enterprises’ production activities and improve the quality of transport services for the population.}

The involved operators are, however, often reluctant to cooperate as they fear loosing valuable information and autonomy, eventually leading their clients to choose another (cooperating) operator. In this paper we propose a real-time co-planning method, called Secure Departure Learning that in real-time lets several truck operators indicate to a barge operator what departure schedules they prefer without revealing any sensitive information. The method uses Paillier encryption and a learning method inspired by Bayesian Optimization in a model predictive control framework. At frequent time intervals a number of potential barge schedules are communicated to the co-planning truck operators. They evaluate their operation cost for each schedule and communicate it to the barge operator encrypted using several public keys. The barge operator computes the encrypted total cost for each schedules, which hereafter is decrypted by several truck operators. The first action of the schedule that results in the lowest total cost is implemented in a model predictive control fashion. Simulated experiments on a realistic, Dutch transport network illustrate that Secure Departure Learning is a good alternative for replacing the current method in practice, where barge departures are scheduled ahead of time and only mode-decisions can be updated in real time. Secure Departure Learning offers a new perspective on cooperation at the operational level in freight transport where co-planning and information protection can go hand in hand.}

abstract = {The selective pickup and delivery problem addresses real-life issues in logistics and transportation. The aim is to optimally select some pickup locations to collect the required demands and unload commodities at delivery locations. Everyday, much of such logistics processes are outsourced to Third-Party Logistics (3PL) companies. However, decentrally truck scheduling by 3PLs specifically when there are only a limited number of warehouse loading docks and time slots will likely cause the random arrival of carriers at warehouses, capacity violation at loading docks, and consequently increased total costs. This study offers a promising approach to optimize the intricate problem of coordination in transportation logistics. We present an integrated time slot allocation and selective pickup and delivery problem while taking real-world variants and constraints, including mixed time windows and capacity, into consideration. To achieve this, we propose a mixed-integer linear programming formulation for the problem. To solve the model, we utilize some valid inequalities and constraints tightening method to strengthen its linear programming relaxation. In addition, a sensitivity analysis is performed on different problem features to validate the presented model. Computational results illustrate the effectiveness of the presented model and valid inequalities in providing faster and tighter results. With respect to the solution time and the number of nodes, the average of both measures drastically is reduced by approximately 90%, followed by tight lower bounds. Furthermore, the value of the integrated model is investigated on larger-sized instances, which shows the proposed model can achieve significant savings and gains compared to the decomposed subproblems of vehicle routing and time slot allocation.}

Hence, both the construction management optimization and the reduction of deployment expenditures should be supported by automated decision support models which include proper representations of predominant uncertainties. One of these is the supply disruption risk that is often ignored in existing models. Therefore, this article proposes a methodology to properly take this construction risk into account. An algorithm to model this risk was developed and a study was conducted to obtain the required probability distributions of disruption delays using real data and expert judgments for an offshore wind farm construction application. The simulation of a realistic test case with an appropriately modified stochastic simulation tool showed that it is important to consider this risk in order to make optimal decisions for different offshore wind farm construction strategies.}

We show how the problem can be modeled as a new variant of the bin packing, for which we provide a mixed integer programming formulation and two heuristics that are shown to be quite effective in solving efficiently and to near optimality the problem. The application of our approach on real data from the city of Turin puts into highlight the superiority of the consolidation approach, including the bundle of goods from different providers, stockholding and other value-added logistics services, over the classical single-tier approach.

In other words, the hinterland represents the set of points of origin/destination of cargo flows, which pass through the port and generate the majority of its business. Following logistics and market transformations, the concept of the hinterland has become rather dynamic and the traditional static approach may be misleading. In particular, it appears rather complex to identify a hinterland's boundaries, due to the influence of drivers that are constantly evolving. Notably, shipping lines, terminal operators, and other logistics players hold a pivotal role in shaping port hinterland development. The ability of port authorities (PAs) to cooperate with the actors of the maritime cluster, as well as inland terminals, seems to be fundamental to extending the network and to enhancing port competitiveness. In this perspective, Notteboom and Rodrigue coined a new concept, defined as “port regionalization”, capable of explaining the new phase of growth of port systems, based on the emergence of broader logistics poles.}

However, facing the structural changes in B2B logistics orders, without any transformation of logistics operating process in distribution centres, LSPs are experiencing serious challenges in handling B2B e-commerce orders. In order for LSPs to grasp the market pie of the logistics and distribution sector of the e-commerce business through improving the core capability of handling B2B e-commerce order in their distribution centres, this paper proposes a novel approach for LSPs to systematically execute B2B order pre-processing so that the B2B e-commerce orders are better managed. An intelligent B2B order handling system (IOHS) is developed for efficient management of discrete, frequently arrived B2B e-commerce orders. By applying the “warehouse postponement” concept through the development of IOHS integrating cloud database management, fuzzy logic, and genetic algorithm approach, B2B order grouping solutions are effectively generated. A case study is conducted in a Hong Kong-based logistics service provider who handles outsourced B2B e-commerce orders, indicating the feasibility of the proposed solution to facilitate e-order fulfilment under both fixed and variable time-window batching settings in distribution centres. A significant improvement in terms of the throughput rate of handling B2B e-commerce order in the distribution centre is found, thereby increasing the satisfaction of buyers and sellers throughout the order handling and delivery process, as well as facilitating LSPs’ capability to manage a larger number of orders received from B2B e-commerce platform, given the greater product exposure of sellers in today’s B2B e-business.}

This paper proposes a multi-faceted approach towards increasing the driving range of ECVs by coordinating the options of: (i) intra-route recharging at an intermediate Recharging Station (RS), with (ii) synchronised en-route battery swapping services performed by Battery Swapping Vans (BSVs) at a pre-planned rendezvous time and space. We introduce and solve a variant corresponding to an Electric Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows, RSs and Synchronised Mobile Battery Swapping (EVRPTW-RS-SMBS). In the proposed model, route planning is carried out synchronously for two interdependent fleets, i.e., ECVs and BSVs, which work in tandem to complete the delivery tasks. To address methodological complications arising from the simultaneous consideration of intra-route recharging at RSs and the synchronised battery swapping on-the-fly, the paper develops a pre-optimisation procedure based on a Non-Dominated Path Identification (NDPI) algorithm that is used in deriving a significantly strengthened path-based formulation of the problem, and an efficient dynamic programming based heuristic algorithm. To gain practical insights on the economic and environmental added value and viability of the proposed logistics model, we compare different scenarios for goods distribution using ECVs in urban and regional levels in London and Southeast England, respectively. A set of numerical experiments are further performed to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms. Our results indicate significant cost and emissions savings and an opportunity for going beyond last mile local deliveries using ECVs with the proposed logistics model.}

Nexus thinking was applied in resource management related to human urine to assess the energy demand using a life cycle approach and economic performance using a cost-benefit approach. Business as usual practices regarding water supply and wastewater management in flushing toilets and the use of synthetic fertilizers in agriculture were compared to a proposed optimization with reduced water flushing in a toilet or urinal, and the proposed urine logistics with a waterless urinal and the use of urine fertilizer. The energy demand was 92-192 kWh in business as usual, 94-117 kWh in proposed optimization and 38 kWh in proposed urine logistics, resulting in a potential saving of 25-154 kWh per person a year in the proposed scenarios. The financial cost was 67-108 USD in business as usual, 9-57 USD in proposed optimization and 32 USD in proposed urine logistics, resulting in a potential benefit of 30-96 USD per person a year. Sensitivity analysis of key parameters was considered in the proposed urine logistics to support decision-making. Urine recovery as presented in this study contributes to multi-sectoral integrated management of resources mainly through natural resource savings, pollution prevention and fertilizer provision optimizing the water-energy-nutrient nexus.}

This study proposes, formulates and solves a collaborative two-echelon multicenter vehicle routing problem based on a state–space–time (CTMCVRP-SST) network to facilitate collaboration and resource sharing in a multiperiod state–space–time (SST) logistics network. The CTMCVRP-SST aims to facilitate collaboration in logistics networks by leveraging the spatial-temporal properties of logistics demands and resources to optimize the distribution of logistics resources in space and time to meet logistics demands. A three-component solution framework is proposed to solve CTMCVRP-SST. First, a bi-objective linear programming model based on resource sharing in a multiperiod SST network is formulated to minimize the number of vehicles and the total cost of the collaborative operation. Second, an integrated algorithm consisting of SST-based dynamic programming (DP), improved K-means clustering and improved non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (Im-NSGAII) is developed to obtain optimal routes. Third, a cost gap allocation model is employed to design a collaborative mechanism that encourages cooperation among logistics service providers. Using this solution framework, the coalition sequences (i.e., the order of each logistics provider joining a collaborative coalition) are designed and the stability of the coalitions based on profit allocations is studied. Results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing algorithms in minimizing the total cost with all other constraints being the same. An empirical case study of a logistics network in Chongqing suggests that the proposed collaboration mechanism with SST network representation can reduce costs, improve transportation efficiency, and contribute to efficient and sustainable logistics network operations.}

abstract = {Multi-modal transportation may be a solution in the immediate aftermath of a disaster when transportation resources are scarce. This study presents a multi-modal relief distribution model using a three-level chain composed of (1) supply nodes, (2) logistics operational areas, and (3) affected areas, while considering multiple trips for disaster response operations. The model determines the location of logistics operational areas, modes of transport utilized, and amount of relief goods allocated for each mode of transport. In addition, the model considers the different phases of essential response factors, such as network and infrastructure conditions, as well as accessibility of supplies and modes of transport. Data from the Yogyakarta Earthquake of 2006 in Indonesia are examined, revealing 11 selected logistics operational areas in which all modes of transport were utilized for relief delivery—mainly trucks and airplanes. For all goods delivered, multi-modal transportation comprised 45.67% of total use (31.98% for airplane–truck, 7.95% for sea vessels–truck, and 5.74% for airplane–helicopter). The results provide an example for decision makers regarding relief distribution systems with multi-modal transportation.}

However, compared with the huge number of Internet users and the huge scale of network economy in China, the utilization rate of fresh e-commerce is relatively low and the profit rate is not ideal. Based on the online survey data of 202 experienced consumers and 192 potential consumers, Amos structural equation model is used to empirically analyze the main factors that affect the online purchase willingness of fresh agricultural products of different types of consumers. The results show that: product quality, logistics service quality, online word of mouth and website information quality have significant impact on experienced consumers to varying degrees. Product quality, online word of mouth and logistics service quality have significant impact on potential consumers, but website information quality has no significant impact on potential consumers. On the basis of strictly controlling product quality and improving cold chain logistics system, fresh e-commerce enterprises should strengthen the comparative advantage of online shopping, strengthen the publicity and guidance to consumers, enhance the attraction of fresh agricultural products online shopping to consumers, promote consumers' choice and form online shopping habits.}

abstract = {Recently, carbon emissions increase apparently in road freight transportation section accompanied with rapidly development of logistics industries in China. However, many published researches used carbon emission calculation model to plan the optimized road transportation route regardless of local regulation-compliant constraints. This study fills this gap by improving carbon emission calculation model for road transportation with several regulation-compliant constraints, such as driving-duration limitation constraint. A transportation route planning case of starting from a logistics hub to a logistics demand node in China is employed to get an optimized Road Freight Transportation Route Strategy (RFTRS). We found that: (1) The carbon emission calculation model in this research gets rid of lack consideration of regulation-compliant constraints of developed carbon emission reducing models in the literature. The optimized RFTRS with the lowest carbon emission is not necessarily meeting driving duration limitation within local traffic regulations and also not with the lowest expenditure in transportation process. (2) The optimized RFTRS should not include too many commodity transfers in intermediate nodes or plan logistics function nodes in reverse-order. In the case, low carbon emission and regulation-compliant requirements for RFTRS are all achieved simultaneously in the shortest expressway routing scenario. (3) The RFTRS optimization process in the case means that high grade roads, such as expressways, and the shorter length of transportation route are the prior selections.}

abstract = {Safety, legibility and efficiency are essential for autonomous mobile robots that interact with humans. A key factor in this respect is bi-directional communication of navigation intent, which we focus on in this article with a particular view on industrial logistic applications. In the direction robot-to-human, we study how a robot can communicate its navigation intent using Spatial Augmented Reality (SAR) such that humans can intuitively understand the robot’s intention and feel safe in the vicinity of robots. We conducted experiments with an autonomous forklift that projects various patterns on the shared floor space to convey its navigation intentions. We analyzed trajectories and eye gaze patterns of humans while interacting with an autonomous forklift and carried out stimulated recall interviews (SRI) in order to identify desirable features for projection of robot intentions. In the direction human-to-robot, we argue that robots in human co-habited environments need human-aware task and motion planning to support safety and efficiency, ideally responding to people’s motion intentions as soon as they can be inferred from human cues. Eye gaze can convey information about intentions beyond what can be inferred from the trajectory and head pose of a person. Hence, we propose eye-tracking glasses as safety equipment in industrial environments shared by humans and robots. In this work, we investigate the possibility of human-to-robot implicit intention transference solely from eye gaze data and evaluate how the observed eye gaze patterns of the participants relate to their navigation decisions. We again analyzed trajectories and eye gaze patterns of humans while interacting with an autonomous forklift for clues that could reveal direction intent. Our analysis shows that people primarily gazed on that side of the robot they ultimately decided to pass by. We discuss implications of these results and relate to a control approach that uses human gaze for early obstacle avoidance.}

abstract = {This paper introduces the multi-depot open location routing problem (MD-OLRP) with a heterogeneous fixed fleet. The problem is inspired by the collection problem of a company which collects raw materials from different suppliers coordinating several carriers. Each carrier has a heterogeneous fixed fleet. Moreover, there is a fixed cost for contracting each vehicle and a variable cost associated with the distance traveled. The empty haul return to the vehicles depot is not considered in the cost. The raw materials collected are delivered to a single delivery point. The problem is modeled as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) that minimizes the total cost, selecting the carriers to be contracted, the vehicles to be used from each contracted carrier and the collection routes. For small instances, the model can be solved to optimality. However, approximate procedures are necessary to handle larger instances. In this sense, in the present work we propose an intelligent metaheuristic which incorporates problem specific knowledge to solve it. The computational results show that the solution method is computationally efficient and provides high quality solutions. In particular, the new solution obtained for the case of study generates savings of 30.86% to the company. The main contributions of the paper are the new problem statement that was not found in the literature, its association to the real problem of a company and the intelligent metaheuristic proposed to solve it. Additional experimentation used the model proposed to solve a simpler problem obtaining new best solutions compared to those reported in the recent literature.}

abstract = {A cold chain is a complex system. It must deal with the requirements of cost efficiency, timeliness, product quality, and environmental impacts as well as the specific technical challenges in handling perishable cargo. Taking an action to accomplish one of these goals might fail in achieving another goal. Hence, one of the most important challenges in cold chain management is to identify solutions balancing cost, quality, and environmental concerns. Additionally, multiple stakeholders are involved in cold chains who have different perceptions of the product quality, economic, and sustainability aspects. There can be a conflict of interests between stakeholders in the chain. Considering the complexity of cold chains, tailored solutions must be designed to trade off different objectives in cold chain design. This paper aims at presenting an agent-oriented simulation framework to support decision-making in the design and operation of cold chains to trade off cost, emission, and quality. To illustrate the simulation framework, a case study of a global banana supply chain is presented and discussed. In the numerical study, the slow streaming strategy and the in-transit quality management system are analysed. The results show the capability of the presented model to analyse different scenarios and evaluate the influence on total logistics cost, emission, and the quality of perishable products. The numerical study results show a trade-off between reducing energy consumption and preserving product quality when changing the vessel speed. Furthermore, integrating quality management with logistics activities could optimize the operational costs and emission along the chain; however, the quality might be lower than a post-transport quality management system.}

This calls for a significant increase to the system flexibility, which might result in the costs associated with energy storage and costly upgrades to the traditional transmission and distribution system. This paper presents a multi-stage battery transportation and logistics optimization method to increase the renewable energy consumptions, economics, and mobilities of the battery utilization. A new approach is proposed in which the batteries are charged in the renewable power plants and transported back and forth by railways between the renewable power plants and cities. Based on the forecasts of battery supplies/demands, multiple optimization stages (full train transport and carpooling) are designed by the branch-and-bound algorithm and genetic algorithm respectively. The proposed battery transportation and logistics concept and model are performed using the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region in China as an example. The results show that the levelized cost of energy of the battery transportation and logistics model is $0.045/kWh averagely. Also, by the use of mobilized batteries, the proposed battery transportation and logistics model increases the system flexibilities and renewable energy deliveries to the end users without the reinforcement of transmission and distribution system and any constraint from a highly penetrated power system.}

This has caused significant impacts on sustainability, especially with operations involving road freight transport. In order to measure the real impacts of this activity and make decisions aligned with sustainability, logistics planners must use methods that consider the economic, environmental and social dimensions. Existing methods for assessing the impacts do not consider these dimensions together, which precludes a complete view of the effects of road freight transport on sustainability. The objective of this paper is to propose a method for assessing the impacts of road freight transport on all three dimensions of sustainability. For this purpose, the main quantitative indicators were identified, a scale was established to classify the impact intensity and the form of the results presentation was defined. Finally, a case study was carried out in a large Brazilian sugar-energy company to verify the method’s applicability. The results showed that the evaluated truck fleets had significant impacts on all dimensions. The proposed method allows companies to have an overall vision of the impacts on sustainability, enabling the identification of impacts with higher intensity and consequently contributing to decision-making processes to mitigate them. This paper also advances sustainable logistics theory by encouraging the development of new research involving logistics and the three dimensions of sustainability.}

The HCD provides an option for the company to store inventory for a period of time without incurring inventory holding costs. This research aims to provide solutions that minimizes the total logistics and inventory-related costs, and obtain several managerial insights. The investigation into the computational complexity shows that the problem is NP-hard. Hence, an efficient bin-packing based heuristic is developed to provide good solutions. Furthermore, to account for the demand uncertainty, we develop an effective rolling horizon operating policy. Besides the proposed heuristics, the research also provides insights into the effects of free storage time at the HCD, which can guide the managers in their interactions and negotiations with an HCD operator. We also show that the length of free storage time at the HCD affects the outbound shipment sizes.}

Any major transportation disruption can have a significant negative impact on the safety, health and wellbeing of affected communities, this is due to the interruption in the availability of food and the supply medicines and fuel. Therefore, preparedness and the forward planning of an effective response are essential for successful emergency and recovery management. Accordingly, in this study, the concept of using AIS (Automatic Identification System) vessel tracking data has been applied for the study of disaster management in coastal communities. The AIS vessel tracking system has been an important development in navigational safety; this is because it continuously transmits important information to all other vessels about a particular vessel (including its position, identity, speed and route). One of the limitations of the AIS tracking system is that AIS data does not indicate commodity specifications: that is, the quantity of essential goods that each vessel is carrying to specified coastal communities. To overcome the limitation of the current AIS tracking system, we use an artificial neural network as an estimation tool. In the current study, AIS data are assessed and analyzed in addition to the augmentation of the capacity information of vessels; thus, the study develops a predictive model so that a relief manager can determine the actual needs of affected residents and thus be able to make responsible relief decisions (e.g., how much relief a disaster-affected community is likely to need). The study makes a unique contribution as its focus seeks to remedy the total lack of research on how to use AIS data in disaster operations.}

Vaccination projects should analyze the supply chain and take it into consideration when planning and creating a vaccination strategy. Adequate supply chain management of the PPR vaccine could lead to reduced cost, increased availability, and the construction of a data platform for other livestock vaccines. Integrating the supply chain of PPR vaccine with other veterinary or health commodities could reduce cost, as well as increase uptake. The use of a thermostable vaccine could potentially have a positive impact on the eradication of PPR in remote areas, such as the Karamoja subregion in Uganda, as it did with rinderpest across Sub Saharan Africa. In terms of vaccine delivery, the use of community animal health workers (CAHWs) could be beneficial in certain areas, such as the Karamoja subregion of Uganda, by alleviating supply chain constraints in the last-mile delivery, as well as increasing coverage and uptake. A gendered approach to livestock vaccines should also be considered, as decision-making power regarding livestock vaccination is gendered in many various contexts. The PPR eradication strategy—as well as other livestock vaccination programs—would be more effective and efficient if the supply chain management were considered as a key component in the process and efforts tailored, accordingly.}

abstract = {Cell and gene therapies have demonstrated excellent clinical results across a range of indications with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)–T cell therapies among the first to reach market. Although these therapies are currently manufactured using patient-derived cells, therapies using healthy donor cells are in development, potentially offering avenues toward process improvement and patient access. An allogeneic model could significantly reduce aggregate cost of goods (COGs), potentially improving market penetration of these life-saving treatments. Furthermore, the shift toward offshore production may help reduce manufacturing costs. In this article, we examine production costs of an allogeneic CAR-T cell process and the potential differential manufacturing costs between regions. Two offshore locations are compared with regions within the United States. The critical findings of this article identify the COGs challenges facing manufacturing of allogeneic CAR-T immunotherapies, how these may evolve as production is sent offshore and the wider implication this trend could have.}

Particularly the last mile of the supply chain increasingly affects consumer satisfaction, while its financial and environmental impact is critical. “Crowd logistics” is introduced as a promising solution. As consumers are increasingly driving innovation and initiatives in the last mile, it is important to know their preferences and perceptions. Our objective is to identify which type of consumer is interested in a crowdsourced last mile and which particular crowd logistics services are considered interesting. To this end, we set up a survey among a sample of one-thousand consumers that represent the Belgian population. The survey is analysed using descriptive statistics and two-step cluster analysis. Analysis shows that consumers support neighbour relays and delivery by retailers’ employees, but general interest is low. A cluster analysis identifies four attitudinal profiles. One segment, labelled the “trailblazers”, are most likely to adopt crowdsourced last mile services: they strongly prefer delivery at home and rely on their community of neighbours when a delivery fails. They are more interested in last mile innovations and sustainability enhancements. The research contributes by taking a consumer perspective on the last mile and by including three types of services and four types of crowd. Three recommendations for retailers are formulated, to focus on a crowdsourcing solution that combines collection and delivery among their employees’ local network, to target consumers that fit the identified profile and to accentuate crowd logistics’ quality of enhancing information transparency.}

abstract = {Collaborative multicenter pickup and delivery problems with time window assignment (CMPDPTWA) are introduced in this paper and formulated and solved as a two-stage optimization problem. First, the collaborative mechanism achieves optimal transportation resource configuration in a multicenter logistics network. Second, open-closed mixed pickup and delivery routes satisfying the demands and time windows of customers are proposed to enhance transportation efficiency and reduce the total logistics operating cost. A set of candidate-time windows is assigned to the corresponding customers through time window assignment (TWA) strategy to increase the operational efficiency of logistics network. A bi-objective programming model for CMPDPTWA is formulated to minimize the number of vehicles and total operating cost. An improved k-means clustering algorithm is used to cluster customers according to their proximities to pickup and delivery centers for reducing the computational complexity to solve the abovementioned problem. A self-learning non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (SNSGA-II) is proposed to optimize the open-closed mixed pickup and delivery routes in CMPDPTWA. An update mechanism for the probabilities of crossover and mutation is devised to improve the efficiency of searching the solution space, and thus to accelerate the convergence of SNSGA-II. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with that of other algorithms, and the results indicate that it can generate near-optimal solutions for CMPDPTWA. A game theoretical method involving a cost gap allocation model and the strictly monotonic path strategy is proposed to find the best profit allocation scheme and the optimal coalition sequence for stabilizing the collaborative coalition. Finally, the proposed method is applied to a case study using the real-world logistics network in Chongqing City, China. Six scenarios with and without the collaborative mechanism and TWA strategy are simulated and compared with one another to verify the efficacy of the proposed method. The results show that the collaborative mechanism and TWA strategy can improve the utilization of transportation resources and operational efficiency. Thus, they can facilitate an efficient and sustainable urban logistics network.}

Many tools have been developed to optimise the blend composition. However, the logistics associated with each component of the blend remain a relatively unexplored field, which can yield significant planning challenges. In this paper, an ant colony optimisation based approach is proposed to address these challenges. The proposed algorithm maximises an objective function composed of a first term related to the quality of the sludge and a second term related to the distance between the sludge generator and the anaerobic co-digester. The algorithm successfully optimises the blend composition by considering the related logistics, achieving an optimum blend with an approximately 18% volume of co-substrate. The approach presented here has been used to plan co-digestion using real data from an actual sanitation network composed of 13 WWTPs in the area of the Besòs river basin in Catalonia, and an optimised co-digestion planning strategy with a waste management cost reduction of 77% was obtained.}

One strategy a logistics provider can employ for meeting these increases in demands and expectations is to complement and coordinate its fleet operations with those of for-hire, third-party logistics providers. Herein, we study an optimization problem for coordinating these operations: the time-dependent profitable pickup and delivery problem with time windows. In this problem, the logistics provider has the opportunity to use its fleet of capacitated vehicles to transport shipment requests, for a profit, from pickup to delivery locations. Owing to demographic and market trends, we focus on an urban setting, wherein road congestion is a factor. As a result, the problem explicitly recognizes that travel times may be time-dependent. The logistics provider seeks to maximize its profits from serving transportation requests, which we compute as the difference between the profits associated with transported requests and transportation costs. To solve this problem, we propose an adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm. The results of our extensive computational study show that the proposed algorithm can find high-quality solutions quickly on instances with up to 75 transportation requests. Furthermore, we study its impact on profits when explicitly recognizing traffic congestion during planning operations.}

We use a gravity model with panel data from 2014 to 2018 across 36 OECD countries, OECD indices of individual country restrictions and regulatory differences by country pair to capture the level of restrictions in these sectors. The results suggest that higher restrictions in the logistics and transport sector lead to lower exports of food commodities. Also, restrictions in the financial and other business sectors are associated with lower imports. Interestingly, restrictions in the distribution sector have positive and significant effects on both exports and imports of food products. The sectors most affected are food, live animals and perishable products (milk, eggs and meat). The regulatory disparity has a significant negative impact on food trade. This impact decreases when the exporter country is closed to service providers. The deregulation or harmonization of these measures would be highly beneficial to food trade.}

In this study, the concept of an intermediate offshore resource centre (ORC) as a potential solution to the logistics problem is presented. The purpose, functional requirements and the conceptual design of an ORC with an illustrative example are discussed. A modular volume-limited ship design concept is adopted here to determine the principal particulars of the ORC in the concept design phase. The required functional elements of the ORC are identified, and then the physical space required for each element is represented graphically as a scaled block with the required volume. The principal dimensions are determined after arranging these functional blocks within a ship-shaped envelope. Finally, the concept design of the vessel system is tested and validated with an analysis of the vessel stability and mooring requirements.}

In this paper, to tackle such problems, a memetic algorithm (MA) with an extended priority-based (EPb) encoding/decoding method based on a flexible combinatorial neighborhood search (NS) strategy is developed. Moreover, to avoid time-consuming repair process in discrete solution representation, a technique to convert the discrete representation to a continuous one is proposed. Finally, to speed up the proposed algorithm, a multi-start simulation annealing (MSA) is embedded to the MA. To assess the quality of the novel hybrid memetic algorithm (HMA), test problems from the small size for accuracy to the real size for efficiency are presented. The results are first compared with commercial solvers and then compared with other genetic algorithms (GAs) and MAs in the literature with different solution encoding/decoding methods and operators. All algorithms are applied for a closed-loop supply chain network design (CLSCND) which deals with locating facilities as well as assigning product flows and inventory costs in a multi-period environment. The results demonstrate the high quality of the proposed HMA.}

We model the information entropy of different low-carbon operations management practices, such as logistics, manufacturing processes and new product development. Then, in light of the role of stakeholder pressures, motivations and barriers, we take a novel approach to assessing the relative importance of elements of the model by using information entropy to develop probabilistically distinctive weightings for low-carbon managerial practices, computed using a variety of models. These models include (a) the Fuzzy Rasch model, which combines Item Response Theory (IRT) and fuzzy set theory; (b) the Fuzzy AHP (Analytic Hierarch Process) model; and (c) the crisp AHP model, based on eight different judgment scales concerning the relative evolution of each criterion/construct. Our results, both expected and unexpected, suggest that: (i) there is heterogeneity in the ways that different companies perceive the issue of low-carbon practices; (ii) while the firms studied are motivated to reduce CO2 emissions and such reduction is required by various stakeholders, the reduction is implemented solely through low-carbon logistics. Unexpectedly, we find that companies are not adopting a full-range of low-carbon operations practices, which may damage their overall performance. Implications for end-users and policy makers are highlighted.}

Given a fleet of trucks, where each truck carries a given number of drones, the objective consists in designing feasible routes and drone operations such that all customers are served and minimal makespan is achieved. We formulate the VRPD as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP), which can be solved by any standard MILP solver. Moreover, with the aim of improving the performance of solvers, we introduce several sets of valid inequalities (VIEQ). Due to limited performance of the solvers in addressing large instances, we propose a matheuristic approach that effectively exploits the problem structure of the VRPD. Integral to this approach, we propose the Drone Assignment and Scheduling Problem (DASP) that, given an existing routing of trucks, looks for an optimal assignment and schedule of drones such that the makespan is minimized. In this context, we propose two MILP formulations for the DASP. In order to evaluate the performance of a state-of-the-art solver in tackling the MILP formulation of the VRPD, the benefit of the proposed VIEQs, and the performance of the matheuristic, we carried out extensive computational experiments. According to the numerical results, the use of drones can significantly reduce the makespan and the proposed VIEQ as well as the matheuristic approach have a significant contribution in solving the VRPD effectively.}

This epidemiological logistics model involves the uncertainty of untested asymptomatic infections and incorporates short-term human migration. Disease transmission is also forecasted through a new formulation of transmission rates that evolve over space and time with respect to various non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as wearing masks, social distancing, and lockdown. The proposed multi-stage stochastic model overviews different scenarios on the number of asymptomatic individuals while optimizing the distribution of resources, such as ventilators, to minimize the total expected number of newly infected and deceased people. The Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) is also incorporated into the multi-stage mean-risk model to allow for a trade-off between the weighted expected loss due to the outbreak and the expected risks associated with experiencing disastrous pandemic scenarios. We apply our multi-stage mean-risk epidemics-ventilator-logistics model to the case of controlling COVID-19 in highly-impacted counties of New York and New Jersey. We calibrate, validate, and test our model using actual infection, population, and migration data. We also define a new region-based sub-problem and bounds on the problem and then show their computational benefits in terms of the optimality and relaxation gaps. The computational results indicate that short-term migration influences the transmission of the disease significantly. The optimal number of ventilators allocated to each region depends on various factors, including the number of initial infections, disease transmission rates, initial ICU capacity, the population of a geographical location, and the availability of ventilator supply. Our data-driven modeling framework can be adapted to study the disease transmission dynamics and logistics of other similar epidemics and pandemics.}

abstract = {This chapter analyzes transport development in China from freight index, economy, and infrastructure perspectives. We focus on coal, which is a special good and reflects the development of the economy. From the perspective of logistics, we provide an overview of Chinese logistics development, and we center our analysis on logistics policy in recent years. After the introduction, we try to focus on several important freight transport problems in China, which remain unsettled, including ports freight, road freight, and logistics cost. We analyze the problem representation, reasons, and solution in some articles. At last, we summarize the freight transport policy in China since 2017 to analyze the development trend.}

abstract = {Animal-based food supply chains lead to significant environmental impacts, which can be influenced by production systems, distribution networks and consumption patterns. To develop strategy aimed at reducing the environmental impact of animal-based food supply chains, the common environmental hotspots among different types of food, the role of transport logistics and the consequence of end market need to be better understood. Life cycle assessment was adopted to model three types of animal-based food chains (beef, butter and salmon), with specific technologies, high spatial-resolution logistics and typical consumption patterns for three markets: local, regional (intra-European) and international. The results confirmed that the farm production stage usually had the greatest environmental impact, except when air transport was used for distribution. Potentially, the role of end market also can significantly influence the environmental impacts. To understand more, three improvement options were examined in detail with regard to hotspots for climate change: novel feed ingredients (farm production stage), sustainable aviation fuel (transport and logistics stage) and reduction of wasted food (consumption and end of life stage). Significant reduction was achieved in the salmon system by sustainable aviation fuel (64%) and novel feed (15%). Minimizing food waste drove the greatest reduction in the beef supply chain (23%) and the international butter supply chain can reduce 50% of GHG mission by adopting sustainable aviation fuel. Combined interventions could reduce GHG emission of animal-based food supply chains by 15% to 82%, depending on market, transport and food waste behaviour. The results show that eco-efficiency information of animal-based foods should include the full supply chain. The effective mitigation strategy to achieve the greatest reduction should not only consider the impacts on-farm, but also detail of the downstream impacts, such as food distribution network and consumption patterns.}
