abstract = {Healthcare supply chain has recently attracted attention by scholars, researchers, government officials and providers as one of the main tools in their effort to manage healthcare cost and improve quality at the same time (Elmuti, et al., 2013). It is reported that healthcare costs in the United States represent a sizeable portion of the gross domestic product and it is expected to increase at a much higher rate than other sectors in the economy. Nevertheless maturity of healthcare supply chain is said behind the commercial supply chain leaving room for improvement (de Vries and Huijsman, 2011). This paper explores strategic areas where healthcare supply chain may enhance efficiency in terms of cost per patient discharge of healthcare operations while improving the quality of care in terms of reducing re-admission rate. This paper argues that fundamentals of supply chain principles should be deployed to create “supply chain community surplus” where resources can be tapped to improve quality of care. Three strategic areas were explored to maximize the provider's revenue; understanding of supply chain principles (perception change), process improvement and deployment of logistics tools.}

abstract = {The combination-vehicle attributes of vehicle routing problems are additional characteristics that aim to consider more effectively the specificities of real logistics applications. Because various combination truck situations exist, the combination truck routing problem (CTRP) is supported by well-developed literature, especially with respect to the truck and trailer routing problem (TTRP), the rollon-rolloff vehicle routing problem (RRVRP), the tractor and semitrailer routing problem (TSRP), and a variety of heuristics. This article first reviews the three primary forms of the CTRP, providing a survey of problem foundations and heuristics for the TTRP, the RRVRP and the TSRP. Next, this report takes a closer look at comparing the three forms of the CTRP. The TTRP aims to efficiently apply trailers that can attach/detach trucks easily to serve less-than-truckload shipping, and the RRVRP and the TSRP aim to attain high use rates for tractors in different full truckload shipping practices. The three forms of the CTRP share a number of common features. In particular, most of the formulations and heuristic strategies developed for specific problems share many similar characteristics. The CTRP is an extremely rich and promising operations research field. More general formulations and more general-purpose solvers are necessary to address practical combination truck routing applications efficiently and in a timely manner.}

To describe the rationale, design, and technical background of coronary artery calcium (CAC) imaging in the large-scale population-based cardiovascular disease screening trial (Risk Or Benefit IN Screening for CArdiovascular Diseases [ROBINSCA]).
Materials and Methods
First, literature search was performed to review the logistics, setup, and settings of previously performed CAC imaging studies, and current clinical CAC imaging protocols of participating centers in the ROBINSCA trial were evaluated. A second literature search was performed to evaluate the impact of computed tomography parameter settings on CAC score.
Results
Based on literature reviews and experts opinion an imaging protocol accompanied by data management protocol was created for ROBINSCA. The imaging protocol should consist of a fixed tube voltage, individually tailored tube current setting, mid-diastolic electrocardiography-triggering, fixed field-of-view, fixed reconstruction kernel, fixed slice thickness, overlapping reconstruction and without iterative reconstruction. The analysis of scans is performed with one type and version of CAC scoring software, by two dedicated and experienced researchers. The data management protocol describes the organization of data handling between the coordinating center, participating centers, and core analysis center.
Conclusion
In this paper we describe the rationale and technical considerations to be taken in developing CAC imaging protocol, and we present a detailed protocol that can be implemented for CAC screening purposes.}

The aim of the study was to assess the relationships between vitality and health and life satisfaction among teenagers between the age of 13 and 17.
Material and methods
The analysed data are taken from questionnaire study done in all voivodships in Poland in 2013/2014 realized in Institute of Mother and Child in collaboration with the Ministry of Sport and Tourism, based on the sample of 2300 pupils at the age of 13–17 (average = 14.8; SD=1.2), with 45% of boys. Statistical analysis included tests such as χ2, t-Student for independent samples and multidimensional models of logistics regression.
Results
Boys comparing to girls and younger pupils (13–14) comparing to older ones (15–17) were more often characterized by high vitality (correspondingly 30% vs. 21% and 29.0% vs. 21.5%; p<0.001). Subjective assessment of health, emotional complaints and life satisfaction were independent predictors of boys’ vitality level. Among girls group the essential factors connected with high vitality were successively: the level of life satisfaction, subjective health, occurrence of emotional complains and age.
Conclusions
Higher level of vitality understood as the inner life energy occurred among boys and younger teenagers can be connected with the level of physical activeness. This construct should be included in research about health and quality of life, taking into consideration positive links between subjective vitality and life satisfaction as well as health and rare occurrence of subjective complaints.}

Patients with poor performance status (PS), usually defined as a Karnofsky Performance Status of 60 or less, were not eligible for randomized stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) studies, and many guidelines suggest that whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) is the most appropriate treatment for poor PS patients.
Methods and Materials
In this retrospective review of our SRS database, we identified 36 patients with PS of 60 or less treated with SRS for central nervous system (CNS) metastatic disease. PS, as defined by the Karnofsky Performance Status, was 60 (27 patients), 50 (8 patients), or 40 (1 patient). The median number of CNS lesions treated was 3.
Results
Median overall survival (OS) was 7.2 months (range, 0.73-25.6 months). Fifteen patients (41%) were alive at 6 months, and 6 patients (16.6%) were alive at 1 year. There was no difference in OS in patients who underwent previous WBRT. There were no local failures or cases of radiation toxicity. Distant CNS failures were seen in 9 patients (25%).
Conclusions
Our patients with poor PS had reasonable median OS and relatively low distant CNS failure rates. Patients in this patient population may be ideal candidates for SRS compared with WBRT given the low incidence of distant failure over their remaining lives and the favorable logistics of single-fraction treatment for these patients with debility and their caregivers.}

Asian wildlife face imminent threats ranging from hunting to loss of critical habitats, but there are few examples of detailed longitudinal wildlife research in the region. Longitudinal research is essential for protecting populations especially in light of the high volumes of legal and illegal trade, understanding basic population dynamics, notably with respect to long-lived species, as well as accommodating the spatial needs of animals. It is also critical for evaluating the success of conservation or management interventions and adaptively improving outcomes. Such studies, particularly when requiring sustained field work, are impeded by mismatches between needs on the ground vs. the priorities of different stakeholders, the ephemeral and inefficient nature of funding mechanisms, and by the logistics of maintaining sites and personnel. Yet we cannot adequately protect biodiversity in Asia unless the magnitude of human impacts on its species is quantitatively understood and used to inform management.}

Yet, the Large Neighborhood Search technique (LNS) has almost never been suggested for solving such problems, although it has proven its efficiency and flexibility in solving other complex combinatorial optimization problems. In this paper, we propose an LNS framework for solving a four-layer single period multi-product supply chain network design problem. One important feature of the model is that it includes inter-modality: the itinerary followed by the cargo from origin to destination may take several transportation modes. Moreover, several modes may compete on some arcs. Location decisions for intermediate facilities (e.g. plants and distribution centers) are determined by the LNS while transportation modes and product flow decisions are determined by a greedy heuristic. As a post-optimization step, linear programming is used to optimize product flows once the structure of the logistics network is fixed. Extensive experiments, based on randomly generated instances of different sizes and characteristics, show the effectiveness of the method compared with a state-of-the-art solver.}

Ever since the China Development and Reform Commission suspended the approval of crop processing programs, second-generation bio-ethanol research and industrialization processes have attracted significant attention. In 2020, bio-ethanol production is predicted to reach 10milliontons. Currently, there are a few domestic enterprises that have established different scaled pilot or demonstration bases for cellulosic ethanol, which reduce the cost of ethanol by continuously improving pretreatment and hydrolysis techniques. In the next three years, these enterprises will realize large-scale commercial production. Given the practical problems in cellulosic ethanol plant construction and operation (e.g., marketing price variation and difficulties in feedstock collection), this paper began with the concept of a “whole-crop refinery” and presented a solution to the integration of industry and agriculture as well as multi-crop refining. This paper then took the whole-crop refining system of corn as an example and presented an analysis of the logistics, energy flow, and economical efficiency of the system. The results demonstrated that the integrated system could properly reduce the required fixed investments in production equipment, shared utilities, and wastewater treatment facilities, as well as reduction of energy consumption. Although the proposed system has several problems, it brings the long-term goal of large-scale commercial application closer than ever.}

Manufacturing companies are striving for flexibility and adaptability to cope with these challenges and remain competitive. Market requirements such as shortened product life cycles, increasing number of variants, and customized products lead to complexity in manufacturing systems. Possible approaches to cope with such challenges can be found in the field of ‘Industrie 4.0’. In particular, decision-making and real-time reaction systems are one way to handle the complexity. To cope with this complexity, digitalization like the vision of ‘Industrie 4.0’ can offer different solutions. However, digitalization leads to an increase of the amount of data describing the status of products and resources within an industrial production environment. In order to achieve a near real time monitoring and control of production and logistics processes, intelligent processing and analyzing of the acquired data is necessary. As a result of this development, so called “complex event processing” (CEP) is essential for analyzing extensive data streams in real-time. In order to derive the rules for a CEP engine, an event model has to be described to visualize the relations, constraints and abstraction levels of production processes. The main focus within this paper is a modeling approach for the situational handling of events within production planning and control. The requirements of the modeling method are focused on the use case of a mass production for carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic CFRP components.}

This paper studies the performance of reliable, unpaced merging assembly lines with asymmetric buffer storage sizes. Lines are simulated with varying line lengths, mean buffer storage capacities and uneven buffer allocation configurations. Contrary to typical manufacturing expectations, results indicate that production line imbalances do not always result in detrimental performance. Higher throughput and lower average buffer levels, as compared to a balanced merging line, are found where total available buffer capacity is allocated as evenly as possible, and with a higher buffer capacity concentration towards the end of the line. This paper contributes to total production line knowledge by providing performance improvement methods for unpaced merging assembly lines with asymmetrical buffer allocation, and inexpensive or no cost managerial options to increase productivity and resource utilization, and decrease waste, in asymmetrical merging assembly lines.}

The development of communication has been defined through the project of the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T). This network has been progressively defined until it has reached the present architecture in which Italy is crossed by four of the nine total corridors that compose the whole network - which means by almost half of the main traffic roads at European level -. Undoubtedly this new geography of European communication offers member States new development opportunities, but it is also true that the distance of the different territories from the major traffic roads can be a disparity factor. In fact, this phenomenon can worsen the marginalisation processes of some European territories, contrary to the objective of the interconnection policy of the EU territories. In front of these possible territorial disparities, the Planning discipline in Italy has not been adequately questioned, aiming instead at the research of the “territorial patching up”, progressively decreasing, rather than at the exploration of new development forms. As a consequence, mobility planning becomes strategic for Italy, especially for its Alpine area. Hence the need to set up valid tools for the environmental evaluation as regards planning and programmes, such as the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA), but also projects, as the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). The idea to realise an important road infrastructure, which may connect Belluno directly with Austria, is presented in this paper as an emblematic case, in which the application of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) permits to verify the best performing infrastructure on a territorial scale.}

A review of the existing body of knowledge and research, stakeholder interviews, and field trips to construction sites were used to help in mapping construction and demolition waste practices. Material flow analysis was employed to assess material flows and recycling rates. Insights developed primarily demonstrated disposal practices used (e.g. landfill and recycling). Logistics pathways and processing quantities of informal and formal recyclers were also revealed. The findings concluded that current practices lacked; appropriate construction and demolition waste classifications; delegation; and control of waste flows by private companies. The major reasons for these issues were that; little efficiency or cost saving strategies were adopted by both public and private actors; bottlenecks exist in waste transport; little attention is given to value adding to concrete waste recycling; and government legislative and financial support for industry transformation is low. These insights are linked to areas for further research, where policy and business strategy opportunities in developing the concrete recycling industry across Vietnam could deliver better social, economic and environmental outcomes.}

Still, a detailed understanding of the fourth industrial revolution and the digital transformation is lacking especially in small and medium sized manufacturing companies. In addition, the fourth industrial revolution is associated by most companies only with logistics as well as production and manufacturing areas. The opportunities to integrate additional functional areas of the production process and the vertical value chain into the concept of the fourth industrial revolution are hardly considered. Starting from the point of view that the fourth industrial revolution is defined as a systematic increase in the flexibility of products and processes through automation, extensive networking and decentralized control mechanisms, as well as a data acquisition and integration through information and communication technologies, a study concept is developed. For this purpose, it is not enough to ask only for the present prevalence of technologies of the fourth industrial revolution. It is necessary to analyze the processes within manufacturing companies. A survey concept is developed that initially breaks down the vertical value chain as well as the production process into specific sub-processes. These sub-processes are analyzed regarding their degree of automation and digitalization and networking among themselves. The results of this survey presents concisely the call for action, the state of implementation and realized solutions of the fourth industrial revolution in Germany.

The application of anaerobic digestion, combined heat and power generation, use of photovoltaic panels and wind turbines were analysed. In the renewables analyses, 25 years of local climatic data were assessed. The influences of air density, temperature and ground reflectance on the renewable generation were also investigated. In order to assess potentials hybrid energy systems for the Brazilian Antarctic Station, possible topologies were organized in groups and then analysed by consumption, performance and feasibility. The methodology supported the identification of an efficient and feasible energy system for the Brazilian Station. The proposed system reached 37% of fuel saves considering the original demand profile of the Station. This work adopted the liter of oil as a currency, thus in any future time the results can be used for financial studies.}

abstract = {Soaring energy demand in developing Asian countries presents a challenge for existing centralized systems and monopolistic electric utilities since these often fail to reliably provide energy service security. Inclusive energy governance could serve as a hedging mechanism against several inherent problems such as supply disruptions and corruption practices, and thus improve energy service security. This study therefore (i) proposes a conceptual framework for energy governance in developing countries and (ii) applies this framework to qualitatively assess the energy service security perspectives of the electricity system in Bangladesh via an interpretive research approach. Relevant governance indicators were first identified in an inductive thematic analysis of systematically selected literature. Bangladesh’s electricity system was then subsequently qualitatively analyzed on the basis of secondary data and official reports. The findings indicate the presence of weak institutions in the electricity sector and a lack of market competition, and the need for consistent policy implementation, proper pricing and information disclosure mechanisms. In addition, other challenges such as endemic corruption and bureaucratic complexities, underdeveloped grids and insufficient resource logistics also need to be addressed. While international interventions and national policies favor a heavy take-up of fossil fuels in order to achieve energy security and energy equity, environmental sustainability is largely ignored. The study concludes that the integration of energy governance and energy security perspectives is crucial to understanding and addressing the challenges of a just energy transition in the face of the standard energy trilemma in developing countries.}

abstract = {Background
Opioid agonist therapies (OAT) in Ukraine were first introduced in 2004 not as addiction treatment, but for HIV prevention. Numerous obstacles have thwarted OAT scale-up, including individual constraints and structural barriers.
Methods
A cross-sectional survey of 1613 opioid dependent people who inject drugs (PWID) were recruited in 2014–2015 using stratified sampling in Kyiv, Odesa, Mykolayiv, Dnipro and Lviv. Analysis was restricted to a subset of 811 PWID who never received OAT. Barriers to OAT were assessed based on reasons why study participants were reluctant to enroll into OAT. A Rasch model from the Item Response Theory was applied to 24 potential barriers, used to score their severity and estimate a latent composite measure for each person’s willingness and ability to participate in OAT.
Results
The Rasch model confirmed the cumulative nature of barriers with concerns over treatment efficacy, safety and tolerability being more prevalent than barriers related to logistical constraints, opportunity costs and social stigma. If barriers related to treatment perception and logistics were eliminated, the average barrier number would decrease from 10 to 2.2. Participants were more likely to have a higher resistance to OAT entry if they experienced fewer overdoses, did not attain higher education, were not previously incarcerated and if their peers did not have a higher level of resistance to OAT.
Conclusions
Understanding the interdependence of various barriers and attitudes toward OAT can improve the rate of OAT expansion and ameliorate entry into substance abuse treatment programs in Ukraine.}

Gap exploiters are third-party firms that create value through the re-utilization of existing products. While extending product life through the gap exploiter model is promising in the transition to a circular economy, business models and policies related to ICT reuse are under-researched in literature and existing studies are characterized by general approaches. While the generalizability of this study has limitations based on size and geographic location, this paper provides an in-depth look at how circular economy strategies can be embodied in the gap exploiter business model within the ICT sector. Main findings include barriers to business operations and opportunities to address them through business model innovation and policy intervention. The study furthers understanding of ICT reuse operations and their related business models. It also contributes to the upcoming policy debate on how to encourage and create a more resource efficient and circular economy.}

In the forward channel of this system, the manufacturer produces the new products, the retailer is contracted to remanufacture the used ones, and then sells both the new ones and remanufactured ones to the customers. In the reverse channel, the retailer and the third party collector simultaneously collect the used products. Based on several valid assumptions, we propose a special closed-loop supply chain model with dual recycling channel within the framework of game theory, and explore how the remanufacturer should properly allocate the collection efforts to the retailer and the third party. Furthermore, we conduct performance analysis to investigate the optimal strategies for the supply chain members. Our research confirms that the remanufacturer can gain more used product returns and profits with dual recycling channel, and the optimal allocation of the collection efforts to the retailer and the third party is determined by the relationship of the reverse logistics cost coefficients.}

There are no evidence-based guidelines to dictate when Gallbladder Polyps (GBPs) of varying sizes should be resected.
Aim
To identify factors that accurately predict malignant disease in GBP; to provide an evidence-based algorithm for management.
Methods
A systematic review following PRISMA guidelines was performed using terms “gallbladder polyps” AND “polypoid lesion of gallbladder”, from January 1993 and September 2013. Inclusion criteria required histopathological report or follow-up of 2 years. RTI-IB tool was used for quality analysis. Correlation with GBP size and malignant potential was analysed using Euclidean distance; a logistics mixed effects model was used for assessing independent risk factors for malignancy.
Results
Fifty-three articles were included in review. Data from 21 studies was pooled for analysis. Optimum size cut-off for resection of GBPs was 10 mm. Probability of malignancy is approximately zero at size <4.15 mm. Patient age >50 years, sessile and single polyps were independent risk factors for malignancy. For polyps sized 4 mm–10 mm, a risk assessment model was formulated.
Conclusions
This review and analysis has provided an evidence-based algorithm for the management of GBPs. Longitudinal studies are needed to better understand the behaviour of polyps <10 mm, that are not at a high risk of malignancy, but may change over time.}

State-of-the-art contactless and passive authentication solutions implement relatively large coils outside of the chip. Therefore, the minimum size is in the order of a few square centimeters, which limits their use for tagging of certain small-sized goods. On top of that, those miniaturized solutions which are available today provide only limited security measures. Here we introduce miniaturized system-in-package contactless authentication devices. This novel solution integrates Infineon Technologies’ CIPURSETMmove IC, which is a state-of-the-art security solution featuring an open security standard, into embedded Wafer Level Ball Grid Array (eWLB) packages, together with HF-antennas, ferrites, as well as discrete elements that improve HF-coupling characteristics. The presented devices provide better HF-coupling characteristics than Coil-on-Chip approaches, which also enable verification of authenticity of tagged products through NFC-enabled smart phones. Thanks to the miniaturized package sizes of 3 × 3 mm, integration into high-priced products, casings, consumable materials, etc., can be achieved in a discreet way. Furthermore, the integrated CIPURSETM chip enables not only the anti-counterfeiting use-case, but also micropayment, ticketing, access control, and password storage in a secured way. Therefore, this miniaturized contactless authentication solution will open up whole new fields of applications.}

An exploratory approach based on target-peak tables and principal component analysis was employed to study the brand-to-brand differences and production variations over time. Despite the complex chemical composition of white spirit samples this study shows that chemical variation during productions is actually quite limited. Hence care has to be taken with the chemical comparison for forensic purposes. Although some clustering was noticed on brand level, the large scale production process leads to a very consistent composition across stores and brands. However, because of the broad specifications of this commodity product, substantial chemical variation was found over time. This temporal discrimination could be of forensic value when considering white spirits supplies in individual households.}

The attainment of the goals and objectives are measured through forecasts of economic, ecological, and social effects. As we noted in Chapter 1, Management of Forests and Other Natural Resources, each natural resource management organization may adopt and implement different forms of planning processes. Inherent in each organization, however, are planning processes that deal with long-term goals and objectives, intermediate concerns, and short-term issues and logistics. The goals and concerns range from broad-scale issues over long-term sustainability to fine-scale operational decisions needed to accomplish daily, weekly, or monthly goals. The planning processes may be integrated into a single planning system, or more likely disaggregated into a hierarchical system. The levels of planning within a natural resource management organization are sometimes clear, and reside in separate parts of an organization. For example, strategic planning might be performed at a corporate headquarters office, while operational planning might be performed at local field offices. In many organizations, especially smaller companies, the levels of planning are not as clear. Understanding the system in which decisions are made will help you achieve one of your personal goals—to be an effective natural resource manager.}

One of the primary barriers in the United States is the regulatory process of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In this article, we will explore the risk-based approach used by the FDA which forms a framework to consider the regulatory pathway and the process to gain regulatory clearance or approval for medical devices. Inherent device properties and the procedural risk of the devices will determine the rigor with which they are scrutinized by FDA, and the evidentiary requirements to legally market them. Data and evidentiary development will vary depending on risk and regulatory precedent and may or may not require clinical data This regulatory paradigm will determine into which risk-based device class they fit, and whether they are regulated under the 510(k) or premarket approval application pathways. The FDA, although gatekeeper of the US market and tasked with determining which products are safe and effective, can be a powerful ally for product development. They have significant scientific and medical expertise, and mechanisms to both provide guidance, and also to consider novel approaches to product development and evidence development. Early interaction for routine and novel products alike can result in expedited and efficient development. This collaborative approach can be best practice to most expeditiously develop the next generation of products, getting them into the hands of US doctors and into the treatment of US patients.}

The multicentre, multinational recruitment of subjects in investigator-initiated clinical trials (IICTs) increases their logistical burden, justifying the need for specific infrastructures to ease implementation. Herein, we provide for the first time an overview of the facts and figures concerning IICTs, existing infrastructures' capacity for interventional clinical research, and scientific performance of investigators in a European country, Portugal. We aim to highlight the relevance and need for investing in European infrastructures such as the European Clinical Research Infrastructure Network (ECRIN) for multinational IICTs. A public, non-profit organisation, ECRIN facilitates the conduct of multinational clinical trials in Europe by coordinating scientific partners and their networks, and providing advice, management services and tools to enhance collaboration. Currently in Portugal, few multinational randomised IICTs are coordinated by national investigators. This is most likely due to the lack of human resources dedicated to clinical trials in clinical research centres (CRCs) as well as the scarcity of professional academic clinical trial units (CTUs) providing logistics and management services at non-profit rates. With the data shown, we expect to trigger the development of similar studies in other European countries and stress the impact of government support for IICTs.}

In this paper we investigate whether pooling stays advantageous if environmental sustainability is considered in addition to the economic performance, i.e. we analyze whether pooling could have a negative impact on the environment and evaluate the resulting trade-off between economic and environmental performance. Within the newsvendor framework we consider three pooling models: pooling via centralized ordering, physical centralization including inventory allocation to the retailers with priority allocation, and transshipments. In addition, we include environmental constraints based on carbon emissions covering all manufacturing and logistics operations of the product.We characterize the optimal policy of the pooling models with emission constraints, make a detailed comparison between the models and compare them to the decentralized (i.e. no pooling) case. Using copulas to model the joint distribution of dependent demands we prove that the profit decreases with increasing demand dependence. Further, if the environmental constraint is binding, optimal inventory level and emissions decrease with increasing demand dependence and pooling harms the environment compared to the case of no pooling. Additionally, we numerically evaluate the impact of copulas and characterize when the economic and environmental performance of pooling can be balanced.}

In 2015, the project “Feasibility and Reliability of Shipping on the Northern Sea Route and Modeling of an Arctic Marine Transportation & Logistics System” was established to perform a comprehensive analysis of the current status and future prospects of NSR transit shipping. The project brought together several partners and numerous participants representing industry, governmental bodies, and research groups from Europe, Asia, and Russia, thus providing a unique and comprehensive overview of the subject. This paper is based on the insights gathered during the project. Firstly, it provides a comprehensive overview of the NSR's current regulations and support services. Secondly, it combines the information on the current status of the route with feedback received from the stakeholders during project discussions for the purpose of establishing several possible future operational models for transit shipping along the NSR. It is concluded that the most probable of the analyzed operational models is a combination of ice-strengthened vessels and independent ice-going cargo vessels. This model requires a decrease in severity of ice conditions to allow for year-round commercial navigation, an increase in bunker prices, further development of maritime infrastructure and icebreaking support, and the development of new maritime insurance models. Additionally, establishing transshipment hubs at each end of the NSR with ice-going cargo vessels sailing between them is also considered to be a viable future option.}

As biomass conversion technologies become reality at the commercial scale for a range of diverse end products, the need to establish bespoke biomass supply chains also becomes a reality and industrial developers will face many business-critical decisions on the sourcing of biomass and location of conversion plants (biorefineries). The research presented here, aims to address these issues through the development of a comprehensive database to aid biomass sourcing and conversion decision-making. The database covers origin, logistics, technical suitability (in this case for a proprietary organosolv pre-treatment process) and policy and other risk attributes of the system.

We illustrate how long-term climate data and observations from farmers’ fields can be combined to quantify risks from seasonal weather and climate variability for nitrogen fertilizer management for corn (Zea mays L.). We developed a probability model for estimating the risk of deficient corn nitrogen status using within-field late-season plant measurements, field information about previous crop, nitrogen rate, form and application timing in combination with rainfall data. Using three grower risk attitudes (risk-tolerant, risk-neutral, risk-averse) we demonstrate the use of deficient corn nitrogen status probability values for making decisions about nitrogen logistics prior to and within the growing seasons and multi-year investments in more efficient and less risky fertilizer management practices. We find these probabilities could enable growers to explore alternative management scenarios (rates, timing and fertilizer forms) for in-season nitrogen management for each risk attitudes. We conclude that annual surveys of corn nitrogen status across Iowa should be useful not only for field-level logistic decisions but also new in-season weather-based plant status monitoring strategies and tools for evaluating business risk from past weather trends or anticipated changes in weather.

abstract = {While the focus of this book is the non-exhaust particulate matter (PM) emission from road traffic, in this chapter we review, more generally, the nontechnological measures available for implementation of air quality plans for road traffic in urban areas. Although more emphasis is provided for abating the non-exhaust emissions, measures on exhaust emissions for NO2 and PM are also discussed. We recommend here a strategy for implementing emission abatement actions, some of them with proven efficacy. This review is preceded by a discussion on the air quality guidelines for PM in the European Union (EU), to justify the need of implementing actions, even when legal requirements for PM are met in European cities, given that (1) EU standards are 2–2.5 times higher than the WHO guidelines and (2) health effects are evidenced for PM levels even below the current WHO guidelines. We classify measures into those devised to (1) attract commuters to public transport instead of private transport; (2) reduce the number of traveling vehicles; (3) accelerate the transformation of the vehicle fleet into more eco-friendly options; (4) include environmental criteria in the city logistics; (5) transform the physical structure of the city to diminish human exposure to pollutants; (6) remediation measures for non-exhaust PM emissions; and (7) other nontechnological measures.}

abstract = {A simulation approach based on transport phenomena is proposed in this paper, to help manage the logistics of fresh broccoli during cold chain. Indeed, for many varieties of fresh vegetables their shelf-life depends critically on storage temperature progress, affecting the visual quality (VQ) as a consequence of changes in intrinsic quality parameters. Broccoli was chosen as a model food, and average ammonium (NH4+) concentration was adopted as a proper quality parameter associated with residual VQ. Therefore, a mathematical model for predicting the residual VQ is proposed depending on the keeping temperature (among 5 and 20 °C), for a relatively long storage duration (up to 12 days). Model validation is brought over by comparing experimental and computed VQ. The predictions were affected by maximum errors of about 3%, 13% and 16% for runs at 5, 10 and 20 °C respectively. The effect of temperature fluctuations were then explored. Two non-isothermal scenarios commonly occurring during retail stores in European and US handlers were first analyzed to test the model's ability to predict the visual quality score. Moreover, the model can be easily applied to assess the household or retail shelf-life, or in general the expiration date after a given storage duration.}

About three quarters of inland freight transport in the European Union is on roads. It has the potential to go through a dramatic change over the next decades thanks to the recent development of technologies such as wireless communication, cloud computing, sensor devices, and vehicle electronics. They enable a new integrated goods transport system based on optimized logistics, real-time traffic information, vehicular communications, collaborative driving, and autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we discuss challenges in creating a more efficient and sustainable goods road transportation system and how some of them can be tackled with a networked control approach. In particular, we discuss a method to improve the efficiency of the transportation system by minimizing the number of empty transports needed to fulfill the assignments on a given road network. Assignments with overlapping route segments might lead to further improvements, as the formation of vehicle platoons yields reduced fuel consumption. For realistic scenarios, it is shown that such collaboration opportunities arise already with relatively few vehicles. The fuel-efficient formation and control of platoons is also discussed. Some of the presented methods have been tested on real vehicles in traffic. The paper shows experimental results on automatic formation of vehicle platoons on a Swedish highway. The influence of traffic density on the merge maneuver is illustrated. The results indicate that platoon coordination could be improved by support from appropriate traffic monitoring technologies.}

This review describes the outcomes of technology application within generic equine science and specific equitation science studies including heart rate monitoring, electromyography, infrared thermography, pressure algometry and remote recording of behaviour and cognitive functioning. The impact of pressure and tension applied by saddles, girths, head gear and gadgets is considered along with subtle behavioural measurements such as eye blink rate, behavioural switching and laterality, some of which reveal aspects brain functioning that have direct relevance to training. Well designed, reliable technology certainly has the potential to provide researchers with a panacea to problems relating to accuracy, precision and experimenter bias, ushering in a ‘golden age of equitation’. However, to reach this stage careful consideration must be given to experimental logistics such as sample selection, device calibration and data processing. A series of potential drawbacks with the use of Technology are identified including managing noise and increasing signal strength, dealing with practical implementation issues and managing the volume of data in order to conduct appropriate analysis to reach meaningful conclusions. Technology users are warned against the temptation to engage in Abductive Science when discussing the output of equitation science methodologies. Putting good research into practice, and vice versa, is crucial to future-proofing equitation and horse welfare.}

Fifty-seven students from a regional Australian university completed an online questionnaire which contained questions about the following areas of ePortfolio use: understanding of the tool; psychological perceptions; challenges around use; assessment; outcomes of use; benefits; maintenance of the ePortfolio; and enhanced learning. The majority of respondents were female, undergraduate students, aged 21–30 years. Results indicated that many students found ePortfolio use frustrating; in particular, technological and logistical challenges in using ePortfolios were highlighted. Most students, however, noted ePortfolios could be useful repositories for documents, reflections and learning experiences. Undergraduate students were more likely than postgraduate students to see the positive potential of ePortfolio use. The findings, coupled with the literature, raise questions about the effectiveness of ePortfolio use in nursing and midwifery education and, particularly, whether ePortfolios have been implemented with misguided and misinformed good intention. Further research is required to better understand the logistical and technological aspects of successful implementation of ePortfolios and fully capitalise on their benefits for nursing and midwifery education.}

abstract = {Private provision of logistics infrastructure through build-operate-transfer (BOT) contracts has become increasingly popular worldwide. These contracts involve incentive conflicts between private sector concerning profit and government concerning social welfare. To coordinate the incentive conflicts, the government usually subsidizes the private sector in practice. In this paper, we propose a stylized model to illustrate how to design an optimal BOT contract with government subsidy. We first derive optimal subsidy levels for the government to obtain optimal social welfare, given concession periods. We further observe that there exist both a substitution effect and a complementary effect between the concession period and the subsidy level. For the former (latter), the subsidy is decreasing (increasing) in the concession period, and the substitution effect can be strengthened if the government has subsidy budget constraint. Interestingly, we find that the private sector does not always prefer the longest concession period. A concession period less than the lifetime of the infrastructure may be more beneficial for the private sector. In contrast, the government's preferred concession period can be either zero or the longest concession period, depending on the unit construction cost and the government's inefficiency cost. We further find that, the incentives of the government and the private sector over the concession period can be aligned when the unit construction cost is low and the government's inefficiency cost is high. We also find that their incentives over the infrastructure's capacity utilization are always aligned throughout the BOT periods.}

These processes require large amounts of energy, which should come from sustainable and, ideally, renewable sources. A strong value chain is required to support the production of valuable products from CO2. A value chain is a network of technologies and infrastructures (such as conversion, transportation, storage) along with its associated activities (such as sourcing raw materials, processing, logistics, inventory management, waste management) required to convert low-value resources to high-value products and energy services, and deliver them to customers. A CO2 value chain involves production of CO2 (involving capture and purification), technologies that convert CO2 and other materials into valuable products, sourcing of low-carbon energy to drive all of the transformation processes required to convert CO2 to products (including production of hydrogen, syngas, methane etc.), transport of energy and materials to where they are needed, managing inventory levels of resources, and delivering the products to customers, all in order to create value (economic, environmental, social etc.). Technologies underpinning future CO2 value chains were examined. CO2 conversion technologies, such as urea production, Sabatier synthesis, Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, hydrogenation to methanol, dry reforming, hydrogenation to formic acid and electrochemical reduction, were assessed and compared based on key performance indicators such as: CAPEX, OPEX, electricity consumption, TRL, product price, net CO2 consumption etc. Technologies for transport and storage of key resources are also discussed. This work lays the foundation for a comprehensive whole-system value chain analysis, modelling and optimisation.}

An email was sent to the board of the randomly chosen facilities with an attached information letter explaining how the survey worked. Hospitals who did not reply to this email were contacted by phone. Among the 206 hospitals that answered the survey, 92 were private, 78 were public and 36 were university hospitals. Median accommodation capacities of ambulatory units were 8 beds, mostly distinct from conventional surgical ward. Patient pathways dedicated to ambulatory surgery appear as the current predominant practice. 77% of the French ambulatory units have a head nurse in charge of logistics and coordination. Several items still have to be improved, such as the adherence to modern fasting rules and the unnecessary use of stretcher to move the patient. Objective discharge score is used in 77% of ambulatory units. This survey highlights the implementation of some positive organisational parameters corresponding to common good practices recommendations. In contrast, several other recommendations are still insufficiently applied and may hamper the development of safe ambulatory surgery.

The conventional way of obtaining hydraulic parameters of aquifers is through the interpretation of aquifer tests that requires a fairly complex logistics in terms of equipment and personnel. On the other way, the processing and analysis of digital images of two-dimensional rock sample micrographs presents itself as a promising (simpler and cheaper) alternative procedure for obtaining estimates for hydraulics parameters. This methodology involves the sampling of rocks, followed by the making and imaging of thin rock samples, image segmentation, three-dimensional reconstruction and flow simulation. This methodology was applied to the outcropping portion of the Açu aquifer in the northeast of Brazil, and the computational analyses of the thin rock sections of the acquired samples produced effective porosities between 11.2% and 18.5%, and permeabilities between 52.4mD and 1140.7mD. Considering that the aquifer is unconfined, these effective porosity values can be used effectively as storage coefficients. The hydraulic conductivities produced by adopting different water dynamic viscosities at the temperature of 28°C in the conversion of the permeabilities result in values in the range of [6.03×10-7,1.43×10-5]m/s, compatible with the local hydrogeology.}

This paper thus seeks to reconstruct post-1989 organisational and ownership transformations in Poland’s rail-, road-, and urban-transport companies, as well as those involved in inland shipping. Where freight is concerned, carriage on standard- and broad-gauge railways can be evaluated as mostly deregulated. In turn, in relation to the carriage of passengers, all carriers existing up to mid-2005 had originated within the PKP (Polish State Railways) Group. The most common form of transformation in ownership of passenger carriers is communalisation of existing companies, with shares in the hands of regional authorities. The first private operator appeared as late as 2007 (the present-day Arriva in the province (voivodship) of Kujawsko-Pomorskie). The disintegration of the national road carrier (PKS) resulted in the founding of about 40 new freight-transport firms, the majority of which were closed down soon. Equally, in the case of the PKS passenger enterprises, the most common form of privatisation has involved leasing by workers. The privatisation occurring previously involved, not only Polish investors, but also foreign capital (Veolia, later taken over by Arriva, and the Israeli Egged Holding via its affiliate Mobilis). However, the share of public-capital ownership remains substantial, often resulting in final bankruptcy of road companies. Among the operators involved in urban transport, public ownership remains dominant in various forms (commercialised, communalised, or budgetary units). In contrast, small private firms dominate in inland shipping. Moreover, systemic transformation plus Poland’s EU accession have given rise to the conditions underpinning the emergence of Europe’s largest shipowners (OT Logistics, the former Odratrans Group).}

It is interesting that the main barriers, those have most impact on coastal shipping development, are not necessarily the ones most widely recognised. The study also uncovers the hidden cause-and-effect relationships between several barriers. Four main barriers are identified: (1) Indian maritime legislation (especially cabotage rules); (2) issues in the infrastructure and procedures at port and port-centric areas; (3) underdevelopment of small ports; (4) lack of a collaborative culture among the various service providers involved in the logistics supply chain. This study finally recommends relaxing cabotage rules to stimulate the inflow of foreign capital to grow coastal shipping, improving the current port system through joint efforts of the ports, Indian customs and government, and fostering supply chain collaboration.}

In 2012, British Columbia (BC) became the first Canadian province to implement an influenza prevention policy requiring healthcare workers (HCW) to either be vaccinated annually against influenza or wear a mask in patient care areas during the influenza season. This study describes an evaluation of influenza policy implementation processes and identifies supports and challenges related to successful policy implementation at the level of healthcare facilities, during the second policy year (2013/14).
Methods
Implementation leaders from 262 long-term care (LTC) and acute care facilities, mostly in three of BC’s five regional Health Authorities, were invited to participate in an online survey following the 2013/14 influenza season. Descriptive quantitative and qualitative analyses identified common and effective strategies for improving vaccination coverage and policy compliance.
Results
A total of 127 respondents completed the survey on behalf of 33 acute care and 99 LTC facilities, representing 36% of acute care and 27% of LTC facilities in BC. Respondents agreed that the policy was successfully implemented at 89% of facilities, and implementation was reported to be easy at 52% of facilities. The findings elaborate on communication and leadership strategies, campaign logistics and enforcement approaches involved in policy implementation.
Conclusion
Implementation of a vaccinate-or-mask influenza policy is complex. This study provides insight for other jurisdictions considering implementing such a policy and offers practical recommendations for facilities and health authorities.}

Analyses also examined concurrent validity of this approach using several teacher- and child-level variables. In total, 1422 Head Start classrooms were observed with the CIS. Factor analyses found that a bifactor model, featuring one factor for overall positive teacher–child interaction as well as two methodological factors accounting for whether items targeted appropriate or (reverse-coded) inappropriate behaviors, fit the data well, consistent with other recent work. Further, evidence of concurrent validity for this bifactor model of teacher-child interaction emerged with lead teachers’ background factors (experience and CDA credential) and their global classroom quality, as well as children’s prosocial skills. Overall, results illustrate both the utility and logistics of the bifactor model approach to measuring interaction quality in early childhood settings.}

The results showed that the round flat, hinged trap design was the most effective and had the highest catch rate. The highest catch rate occurred after 5days and the authors recommend 3–8day soak periods for commercial trapping operations. The trials showed that fish bait attracted much higher diversity and quantities of by-catch than algae baits. The more bait stations (of either algae or fish bait) used the greater the catch. However, increasing the number of bait stations also increases the cost and time required to set the bait stations. The authors recommend a minimum of two bait stations per urchin trap to optimize CPUE. Comparisons of trap catch rate and associated costs and logistics indicate that trapping is an economically viable alternative to SCUBA diving and other harvest techniques in Norway.}

For this reason, companies use lean approaches to make their processes more effective and efficient. To reach this goal, the principles of Lean Manufacturing have been transferred to the PDP. In the current situation, many companies have recognized the numerous potentials of Product Development (PD), which can be realized in companies with the so-called ‘Lean Development’ (LD). Apart from these advantages, a major problem can be identified: On the one hand, the development process is an increasingly important core process in companies, but on the other hand, companies are decreasingly the owners of these processes. A shift in development activities takes place towards the suppliers. As a result of this shift, suppliers become a very important factor for the success of the PDP and the entire company. This current situation necessitates a systematic integration of suppliers within PD. Existing management approaches for a systematic integration of suppliers have substantial deficits. Based on this research gap, findings were generated as part of a study and a comprehensive analysis in the context of a research project. The results confirm that numerous savings can be achieved for the factors development quality, time, and costs. Business cases show, however, significant deficits in the long-term focus of supplier relationships. In order to improve this issue, the integration requires an extensive analysis of the current business organization and a restructuring of development processes. A selection of the results and findings of Supplier Management and future fields of action are presented in this publication.}

There is scant research exploring how sex and ridership status correlate with perceived barriers, which is a known barrier to being physically active. A total of 1334 Baltimore City residents aged 18 to 75 participated in an online survey (February-March 2014) assessing the major barriers to bicycling in the city. Differences by sex and ridership status were examined independently and interactively. Most respondents were women (60%) and not regular riders (66%). Safety due to traffic was the biggest barrier for non-riding women (77%) and non-riding men (54%). Weather was the biggest barrier for riding women (55%) and riding men (51%), followed by safety due to drivers (45% and 33%, respectively). Sex and ridership differences were also found for barriers regarding preference and logistics of transport. For example, riders had lower odds than non-riders of rating biking as less comfortable than driving as a major barrier, OR=0.39, p<0.01. Furthermore, women had greater odds than men of rating it is difficult to carry things on a bike as a major barrier, OR=1.65, p<0.01. Interactions between sex and ridership status revealed that riding women had lower odds than riding men of rating a) needing others to travel, OR=0.32 and b) hygiene, OR=0.41, as major barriers, p's<0.05. We discuss these findings in the broader context of the literature, and offer strategies for addressing specific barriers to bicycling.}

Numerous studies on congestion cost estimation, that aim to quantify their monetary losses, have been conducted. Value of Time (VOT) assessment through utility maximizing theory and choice models are abundantly applied in transport literature. However, estimating VOT on congested network is not widely applied yet. To recognize the difference under normal and congested network, the current study focuses on VOT estimation for work trips in an extremely congested network.The focus of this research is to conduct a VOT estimation of the National Highway, Karachi. It connects Karachi city with Port Qasim Industrial area and the rest of the country. A large amount of freight transport to and from the port is also observed on this road. The National highway, being the only link to commute to this industrial area, is therefore under excessive traffic congestion.A stated preference (SP) survey was conducted at various industries located in this stretch. The respondents were asked about current travel practices and their (stated) preferences based on hypothetical -though realistic- travel attributes. A choice set of four alternative modes based on the currently used mode was presented to each individual. A Multinomial Logistics Regression (MNL) Model was developed for data analysis.As perceived, the results revealed a strong impact of travel time and travel cost on the (dis)utility of travel. These results can be utilized by policy makers to reduce congestion, monetary and time losses through efficient transport planning.}

One evidence was that people need few techniques to solve most of problems provided these were well stated, so that the work left open the following issue: “what important to invest in?

The paper starts its analysis from the definition of a service though its intangibility, then it investigates how LESE (Laws of Engineering Systems Evolution) can be used to identify improvement paths and, eventually, it proposes a selection of Inventive Standards suitable for service improvement and innovation. The evaluator can perform an exhaustive analysis or a rough one depending on she/he is looking for quick idea of service maturity level or needs to define a complete problem solving work to assign to a project team.

Although carbon releases are associated to the ecosystem functions of climate regulation and are essential ecological processes that sustain life, their incremental economic impact is difficult to estimate. Using the InVEST model, this work quantifies and assesses the value of the carbon balance generated by predictive land-use change (LUC) scenarios for the Northern Coast of São Paulo State, Brazil. In this case, carbon losses are explained by the suppression of natural vegetation and human intervention associated to global warming. We analyzed three scenarios: i) the more conservative “legal framework”; ii) the “status quo”, which represents the current development level; and iii) the “new ventures”, encompassing all new infrastructure projects in the region. The carbon losses in the “legal framework” and “status quo” scenarios are similar to those of past periods: around 3.7 million MgC in twenty years, pointing to net current values of US$ 47 million. However, carbon losses exceeded 7 million MgC when considering factors linked to the “new ventures” scenario, such as infrastructure logistics, oil-gas exploration and pressure on natural environments. In this case, monetary losses could amount to US$ 90 million in 20 years. Besides carbon release, results also highlight the large amount of carbon still stored in protected areas that is threatened by the regional economics dynamics and requires special attention from the public sector, management bodies and regulators.}

However, due to the complexity inherent in dealing with uncertainty, most research has been devoted to deterministic problems. This paper considers a robust version of the vehicle routing problem with hard time windows, in which travel times are uncertain. A budget polytope uncertainty set describes the travel times, to limit the maximum number of sailing legs that can be delayed. This makes sure that improbable scenarios are not considered, while making sure that solutions are immune to delays on a given number of sailing legs. Existing exact methods are only able to solve small instances of the problem and can be computationally demanding. With the aim of solving large instances with reduced running times, this paper proposes an efficient heuristic based on adaptive large neighborhood search. The computational study performed on instances with different uncertainty levels compares and analyzes the performance of four versions of the heuristic and shows how good quality solutions can be obtained within short computational times.}

In this paper, the assignment problem considers the strategic and tactical decisions together, which involves the mapping of components to geographically distributed plants, the selection of logistics services between the mapped plants, and the allocation of inventories in each plant. The goal of this paper is to find the optimal assignment with the minimum total cost under the constraint of production rate. We first mathematically formulate the problem as a mixed integer linear program. Then, by deriving the properties of pipelined production in supply chain networks, we develop dynamic programming algorithms to efficiently obtain the optimal assignments. By the consideration of high degree of pipelining, our techniques can make a good tradeoff between high production rate and low operation cost. Extensive computational experiments show that the proposed algorithms can find high quality solutions, which achieve significant improvement compared with the initiative approaches.}

In order to determine this location one can use a different mathematical models that describe the location according to the accepted constraints and criterion functions. This paper presents the warehouses location in the logistic network. The logistic network consists of suppliers, potentially warehouses with the known location and recipients. The variety of constraints that must be considered e.g. the production capacity of suppliers, buyers, the storage capacity makes it difficult to decide on the final location of objects of the logistic network. The warehouse location problem in the logistics network is multi-criteria optimization problem that depends on quantitative and qualitative criteria. In general, the optimization criteria takes the form: minimal storage costs, transition costs of the cargo through warehouse facilities, the cost of cargo transport to the warehouse facility, etc. The complexity of the warehouse location problem dictated by the diversity of constraints and decision variables (e.g. the type of binary decision variables and the real type of variables), the search for the location of many warehouse facilities at the same time, multi-criteria aspects of the problem imposes the need for the application of an appropriate optimization algorithm adequately to the presented location problem. The genetic algorithm is a practical optimisation tool solving many difficult decision problems. It should be underlined that in complicated problems this tool does not guarantee the optimal solution, but sub-optimal. Despite that, the quality of the solution is accepted by decision-makers.}

Using reported ages at initiations, 7 sequences were identified: initiation of tobacco only (T), cannabis or OID only, tobacco followed by cannabis (T–C), cannabis followed by tobacco (C–T), alternative 2-substance sequences, gateway sequence (T–C–OID) and 3-substance alternative sequences. Logistics regressions were performed to study the impact of sequence on further use (tobacco, alcohol, cannabis and OID), and substance use disorders (SUD) (tobacco, alcohol and cannabis). The most observed sequences were T (45.5%), T–C (20.5%), C–T (5.1%) and T–C–OID (3.5%). Further use and SUD likelihoods, whatever the substance considered, increased with the number of substances previously initiated. However, for a same number of substances initiated, current use and SUD likelihoods did not significantly vary according to sequence. Polysubstance initiation appears as a better predictor of further use and SUD than the initiation sequence, questioning the GT and being more in line with a common liability to substance use.}

Different models have been developed within the supply chain area to manage inventories and solve related issues (i.e. logistics and transportation). Consignment stock (CS) is an IM technique that has been shown to improve supply chain performance, where a vendor uses its buyer’s warehouse to store its items. The buyer pays the vendor once the items are withdrawn from the consigned inventory. This paper investigates the CS policy in a two-level (vendor–buyer) supply chain when it is permitted to delay payments. This is a business practice found in CS contracts. An equal-interval equal-payment scheme is considered, and three scenarios of delayed payments have been developed. The first scenario (base model) does not consider delay-in-payments, where the second (interest-free) and the third (with interest) do. The results showed that offering the buyer a permissible period to settle its account is better for the system than paying the vendor at the time of the invoice. In addition, the third scenario, where the buyer pays the vendor after the permissible period and is charged interest, was shown to be the most profitable for the supply chain system considered.}

The total material travel distance is a key indicator of the efficiency of internal logistics. Changes in demand and product mix may alter the material flow. The dynamic facilities layout problem (DFLP) takes into account changes in demand and allows for the periodic redesign of facilities. Facility redesign may reduce the material flow cost, but there is a trade-off between material flow improvements and reorganisation costs. There is a limited literature on the redesign of facilities with stochastic demand, heterogeneous-sized resources and rectilinear material flow. The Backtracking Search Algorithm (BSA) has been used to successfully solve a range of engineering problems, but it has not previously been used to solve operations management problems or the FLP. This paper outlines novel modified Backtracking Search Algorithms (mBSAs) that solved the stochastic DFLP with heterogeneous sized resources. The combination of material flow and redesign costs were minimised. Three mBSA were benchmarked against the classical BSA and a Genetic Algorithm (GA) using 11 benchmark datasets obtained from the literature. The best mBSA generated better solutions than the GA for large-size problems. The total costs for the layouts generated by the best mBSA were significantly lower than for the conventional BSA. The modifications to the BSA increased the diversity of candidate solutions, which increased the amount of exploration. The computational time required by the three mBSAs was up to 70% less than the GA.}

Considering internal logistics activities, shortening material flow distance within a manufacturing area can lead to efficient productivity and a decrease in related costs. The robust machine layout is concerned with determining the efficient arrangement of machines/facilities located on a manufacturing shop floor under future demand fluctuation. A robust designed layout is essential for a company to maintain a high productivity rate through multiple time-periods of demand uncertainty with minimum effects related to the re-layout time and cost, manufacturing disruption, and the movement of monument machines. The objectives of this paper were to: i) describe the development of a computer aided layout designing tool for minimising the total material flow distance under dynamic demand scenario, ii) investigate the appropriate setting of TLBO parameters, and iii) propose four TLBO modifications for improving its performance. The modified TLBOs were inspired by multiple teachers with two types of classes and two approaches to teacher selection. The numerical experiments were designed and conducted using eleven MLD benchmarking datasets. Statistical analyses on the experimental results showed a superior performance for the proposed modifications.}

For milk, 18.1% of its annual production is lost or wasted due to insufficient storage, logistics, and freshness (expiration date) issues. Presently, the most common method of managing waste milk is disposing large volumes of waste milk into landfills, which raises concerns on groundwater pollution and local ecosystem disturbance. Casein is a protein-type biopolymer that consists of approximately 24.4 kg from 1 ton of bovine milk. In this study, casein is introduced as a new binder for soil strengthening in geotechnical engineering and dairy waste management purposes. Bovine casein is provided in a solution state for proper mixing with soil. Casein-soil mixtures with different casein contents are prepared to evaluate unconfined compressive strengths at both dried and re-submerged conditions. Experimental results show significant soil strengthening induced by casein treatment even after 24 h of re-wetting, which implies the potential of applying casein-soil mixtures for water-resisting purposes. Feasibility analyses for casein utilization from dairy and milk wastes are provided with socio-, environmental, and engineering aspects, showing both future opportunities and challenges of recycling casein as a soil binder in engineering practices.}

Results
In the first year, 145 eligible women were informed about the trial at 13 centers, of whom 50 (35%) provided informed consent. Patient accrual ranged from 0 to 57% per center. Most common reasons for not participating were: not willing to participate in any trial (43.2%) and not willing to risk receiving no adjuvant treatment (32.6%). Analysis of the pathology database showed an average time between randomization and determination of the molecular-integrated risk profile of 10.2 days (1–23 days). In 5 of the 32 patients (15.6%), pathology review took >2 weeks.
Conclusions
The PORTEC-4a trial design was proven feasible with a satisfactory patient acceptance rate and an optimized workflow of the determination of the molecular-integrated risk profile. PORTEC-4a is the first randomized trial to investigate use of a molecular-integrated risk profile to determine adjuvant treatment in EC.}

Collaborative aspects are addressed by several research activities, namely Systems Engineering and more precisely by Model Based Systems Engineering. This work contributes a new method for interdisciplinary communication by an integrated visualization of conceptual models. The method describes an environment for direct communication between experts in related disciplines. Common application scenarios are business process management workshops in which process experts have to achieve commitment with experts from other disciplines like computer science, logistics or engineering. Especially in Industry 4.0 scenarios, mutual understanding between experts from several domains is crucial for a successful process setup, planning and preparation of production scenarios. The method comprises a theoretical framework for establishing inter-model relationships and their visualization. For establishing links between models, an ontology based approach is applied. The Bunge-Wand-Weber Ontology for information systems provides a generic and yet applicable basis for establishing consistent inter-model relationships. For supporting communication processes the integrated models should be displayed. To provide an understandable visualization a three-dimensional environment is proposed, in which the linked models are arranged and displayed. The scientific basis is given by applying the concept of visual variables described in the scientific discipline of information visualization. The depth of space extends the set of visual variables. Applied to the semantic concept of integrated models a discriminable visualization of integrated models is achieved.}

abstract = {Background
Coexistence of multiple chronic diseases is highly prevalent among the cancer population. This study aims to assess changes in the prevalence of chronic conditions among the population with cancer compared to the Australian general population between 2007 and 2014.
Methods
Data from three successive National Health Surveys conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics between 2007 and 2014 were utilized. Comparisons were made between the samples of the Australian population aged 25 years and above with a history of cancer and those respondents who did not report having had a cancer using logistics regression models.
Results
People with a history of cancer had significantly higher odds of reporting non-infectious comorbidity compared to the non-cancer groups across the three surveys. There were no significant changes in the prevalence of diseases affecting circulatory, musculoskeletal, digestive, nervous system, blood and blood forming organs, eye, skin and infectious and parasitic diseases over time among the population with cancer. The prevalence of mental and behavioural problems, endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases, and diseases of respiratory and genitourinary system has increased over time among the cancer survivors.
Conclusion
Comorbidity is more prevalent among the cancer population than the general population without cancer. The prevalence of comorbidity was fairly stable for most but not all comorbidities in the population with cancer over the eight-year study period. Further studies on the impacts of coordinated care models for the management of multi-morbidity experienced by cancer survivors that align with the ‘National Strategic Framework for Chronic Conditions’ are needed.}

Traditional approaches focus on the technical problems only. Little attention has been paid to the institutional analysis of biofuel supply chains. This paper aims to extend the analysis of the effect of institutions on the emergence of biofuel supply chains by developing a conceptual framework that combines elements of complex adaptive systems, (neo) institutional economics and socio-technical systems theory. These elements were formalized into an agent-based model. The proposed method is illustrated by a case study on a biodiesel supply chain in Germany. It was found that the patterns in production capacity result from investors basing their decisions on optimistic perceptions of the market development that increase with a favorable institutional framework. Conversely, patterns in biodiesel production cannot be completely explained by this mechanism. The proposed framework assisted the model conceptualization phase and allowed the incorporation of social structures into the agent-based model. This approach could be developed further to provide insights on the effect of different future deployment strategies on bioenergy systems emergence and development.}

The part played by the reservoirs in triggering is not exactly known due to lack of near field observations of triggered earthquakes. Koyna, located near the west coast of India, where triggered earthquakes have been occurring since 1962 provides an excellent site for near field observations of the target M≥2 earthquakes. A 6 borehole seismic network has been deployed recently in the Koyna region at depths of 981–1522m to improve the hypocenter locations. During May–December 2015, a total of 1039 earthquakes of ML≥0.5 were located using the borehole seismic network. The region is also monitored through a dense network of 23 surface broad-band stations. Our analysis indicates a significant improvement in the estimation of absolute locations of earthquakes with errors of the order of ±300m, combining both the networks. Based on seismicity, and logistics, a block of 2×2km2 area has been chosen for drilling the first pilot borehole of ~3km depth, where M≥2 earthquakes have been occurring frequently since 2005.}

In this regard, this chapter was designed to discuss, briefly but exhaustively, about the quality- and sustainability-related issues of biopolymers, thereby exploring their feasibility of usage for food packaging purposes. In particular, the attention was focused on poly(lactic acid) (PLA) as it is currently acknowledged to be one of the most versatile and widespread biopolymers: a review of its technical and environmental issues was performed. This chapter highlighted PLA to be more environmentally sustainable than nonbiodegradable polymers, on an equal function basis. However, its supply chain still represents a problem because the cultivation of the starchy crops generally used for its production is often performed in countries that are far away from the majority of the processing plants. Hence, the PLA granule delivery phase involves long distances and different transport means and subsequently causes significant impacts in terms of nonrenewable energy resource exploitation and emission of greenhouse gases. This remarks the importance of the transport and logistics system to be considered in the whole PLA supply chain and, at the same time, the need to search for alternative ways of PLA granule production that avoids involving those large pieces of land for cultivation.}

Combining k-means clustering algorithm and an improved Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (Im-NSGA-II), this paper proposes a three-phase approach to simultaneously minimize the aggregate operating cost and reduce carbon dioxide emission. To ensure the initial population's quality, the sweep algorithm is integrated as modification of the standard NSGA-II. The chromosome population consists of multiple depots and corresponding customer nodes independently assessed to find local solutions, and latterly combined to yield suboptimal routes. The nodes scan principle of the sweep algorithm is employed to enforce optimization constraints, and the non-dominated sorting of the population efficiently improves the solution search accuracy. Further, the Minimum Cost-Remaining Savings (MCRS) method is used to determine appropriate profit distribution schemes, and the selection of the optimal sequential coalition is executed on the basis of the strictly monotonic path principle. Computational comparisons on benchmark instances indicate the superiority of Im-NSGA-II over NSGA-II and MOGA, and an empirical study in Chongqing, China confirms the practicability of our solution approach. The evaluation of MCRS solution's stability displays outperformance over other methods including the Shapley value model, CGA and GQP, and suitable coalition sequences are selected and assessed to improve the efficiency of logistics network optimization as well as the achievement of environment-friendly objectives.}

We then use these drivers to project road freight service demand, vehicle stock, mileage, sales, final energy demand, and well-to-wheel GHG emissions using the IEA’s Mobility Model (MoMo) under two scenarios – the first incorporating the policy ambition of the Nationally Determined Contributions pledged at COP21, and the second extending ambitions to emission reductions that are in line with limiting global temperature rise to 1.75 degrees. In the former scenario, road freight well-to-wheel GHG emissions increase by 56% between 2015 and 2050, while in the latter, sectoral emissions are reduced by 60% over the same period, reflecting our assessment of the threshold of emission reductions potential. This reduction is catalysed by policy efforts including fuel economy regulations, carbon taxes on transport fuels, differentiated distance-based pricing, widespread data-sharing and collaboration across the supply chain as enabled by digital technologies, and sustained investment in ultra-low and zero-carbon infrastructure and research development and deployment.}

For the past decade, it has been seen a sharp rise for online shopping activities across the UK. Many customers now prefer to purchase goods online and demand a fast delivery of ordered products to be dispatched directly at their door steps. Thus, there is a desire for these sectors to seek even more efficient and effective methods for storing, picking and dispatching goods in increasingly centralised distribution centres in which automation and integration of warehousing systems is inevitable. As part of a study for future generation warehouses, this paper presents an investigation into a methodology in which an RFID-based inventory management system has capability of interacting with a proposed RFID-enabled automated storage and retrieval mechanism without any human intervention. To maximise efficiency in material-handling operations and minimise operational costs, a selection algorithm was developed within the RFID-inventory management system to seek an optimal solution in which it allows a manipulation of RFID-tracked items under pre-defined rules by assigning a priority (in an order if applicable) to one of selected items to travel to a specified collection point. A pilot test was carried out for examining the feasibility and applicability of the RFID-based management system based on the developed selection algorithm. In theory, such a system can be expanded by incorporating any pre-defined selection parameters.}

Because of that, there is no guarantee that the process will be executed — and the objects be manipulated — as previously agreed by the parties. The problem is usually addressed through a centralized monitoring entity that collects information, sent by the involved parties, on when activities are executed and the artifacts are altered. This paper aims to tackle the problem in a different and innovative way: it proposes a decentralized solution based on the switch from control- to artifact-based monitoring, where the physical objects can monitor their own conditions and the activities in which they participate. To do so, the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm is exploited by equipping physical objects with sensing hardware and software, turning them into smart objects. To instruct these smart objects, an approach to translate classical Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) process models into a set of artifact-centric process models, rendered in Extended-GSM (E-GSM) (our extension of the Guard-Stage-Milestone (GSM) notation), is proposed. The paper presents the approach, based on model-based transformation, demonstrates its soundness and correctness, and introduces a prototype monitoring platform to assess and experiment the proposed solution. A simple case study in the domain of advanced logistics is used throughout the paper to exemplify the different parts of the proposal.}

Hidden potentials can be found not only in logistics industries, but also in businesses offering home deliveries and other services. Insight into drivers, constraints and companies' requirements allows recommendations to be derived for municipalities to stimulate cargo cycles' market penetration. These recommendations address regulative frameworks, strategic urban planning, infrastructure adjustments, testing programs, collaborations with the private sector, platforms for knowledge transfer, and the use of cargo cycles by public authorities.}

The structure of the chromosomes, the operators, and the constraint handling strategy are specifically designed for multi-period problems. Several test instances have been generated to compare the performance of the proposed GA with that of a branch and bound solution procedure. Moreover, a comprehensive statistical analysis is conducted to illustrate the performance efficacy of the proposed GA relative to the branch and bound algorithm. This analysis reveals that the GA provides a substantial decrease in the computational burden when compared to the branch and bound algorithm.}

In order to improve its schedule for client visits, the company faced a two-level problem: first, to determine the days for client visits (``visit calendar'') for each client during the planning period, and then to design the corresponding daily routes. To do so, two objectives were considered: minimization of transport costs and minimization of the number of changes to the existing calendar of visits. This model could be considered as a variant of the well-known periodic vehicle-routing problem (PVRP) with two objectives. A solution method that combines tabu search and MOAMP (Multiobjective Adaptive Memory Programming) strategies is proposed for this model. Also this method is compared with an adaptation of NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm), a well-known strategy to multi-objective optimization. The computational results show that the MOAMP-Tabu Search method performs better.}

Accurate BFD quantification is critical for the assessment and certification of personal protective equipment, such as body armor and helmets, and ballistic evaluation. A common witness material is ballistic clay, specifically, Roma Plastilina No. 1 (RP1). RP1 must be heated to nearly 38°C to pass calibration, and used within a limited time frame to remain in calibration. RP1 also exhibits lot-to-lot variability and is sensitive to time, temperature, and handling procedures, which limits the BFD accuracy and reproducibility. A new silicone composite backing material (SCBM) was developed and tested side-by-side with heated RP1 using quasi-static indentation and compression, low velocity impact, spherical projectile penetration, and both soft and hard armor ballistic BFD measurements to compare their response over a broad range of strain rates and temperatures. The results demonstrate that SCBM mimics the heated RP1 response at room temperature and exhibits minimal temperature sensitivity. With additional optimization of the composition and processing, SCBM could be a drop-in replacement for RP1 that is used at room temperature during BFD quantification with minimal changes to the current RP1 handling protocols and infrastructure. It is anticipated that removing the heating requirement, and temperature-dependence, associated with RP1 will reduce test variability, simplify testing logistics, and enhance test range productivity.}

The study of the economical sustainability of advanced biorefineries requires a holistic optimisation approach along the entire biorefining supply chain (i.e. biomass cultivation, storage, transportation, processing as well as products storage and delivery) over the long-term in order to simultaneously achieve a full exploitation of lignocellulosic biomass (and its macrocomponents) as well as to identify the optimal logistics and configurations of the biorefining network.

A Hungarian real case study is proposed to demonstrate the feasibility of the model.

Dust emission and explosions, degradation in storage, self-heating and ignition are important criteria when designing a wood pellet port terminal, and can greatly affect associated logistics. Despite some availability of data concerning the handling of pellets, there is a lack of insight into the equipment and operations of actual handling facilities. A detailed literature research was performed in order to ascertain the level of the scientific background on the subject. Subsequently, visits in pellet facilities in the Netherlands and in-depth interviews with representatives were conducted and serve as a means of gaining an overview of current industry practices and equipment used for the handling of wood pellets. The main objective of this work is to evaluate the state-of-the-art in wood pellet handling in import terminals. This way, future bottlenecks can be identified and actions needed to overcome them can be determined. The analysis performed shows that while wood pellet terminals might be able to cope with the low amounts being traded currently, a reexamination and redesign of terminal facilities to accommodate the increased volumes will probably be required by 2030.}

Regarding their energy use manufacturing firms can improve their carbon performance either by reducing energy use or by switching to energy sources that cause less carbon emissions. Energy management systems are said to support improvements in carbon performance, however their effect has hardly been addressed to date by academia. Based on data from 108 German automotive suppliers, this paper investigates the impact of an energy management system on manufacturing firms' operations practice as well as carbon and economic performance. The research model developed for this is evaluated using partial least squares. The results indicate that energy management has a positive effect on the adoption of low carbon production and logistics practices and through this indirectly on carbon and economic performance. The effect is found to be stronger for certified energy management systems. Surprisingly no proof is found for a direct effect of an energy management system on carbon performance.}

Recent studies suggest that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is involved in the development of major depressive disorder. The aim of this study is to investigate the interaction between vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) polymorphism (+405G/C, rs2010963) and negative life events in the pathogenesis of major depressive disorder (MDD).
Methods
DNA genotyping was performed on peripheral blood leukocytes in 274 patients with MDD and 273 age-and sex-matched controls. The frequency and severity of negative life events were assessed by the Life Events Scale (LES). A logistics method was employed to assess the gene-environment interaction (G×E).
Results
Differences in rs2010963 genotype distributions were observed between MDD patients and controls. Significant G×E interactions between allelic variation of rs2010963 and negative life events were observed. Individuals carrying the C alleles were susceptible to MDD only when exposed to high-negative life events.
Conclusions
These results indicate that interactions between the VEGF rs2010963 polymorphism and environment increases the risk of developing MDD.}

The main goal of research works undertaken so far in this area was to improving the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the indoor traffic, by transporting optimally and sustainably freight from ship to the logistics and unloading areas. The use of a team of IAVs with wireless communication capabilities by rearranging efficiently all operations of handling, routing,…is a strategic objective for seaport authorities and their customers. In this paper, we consider inter-Vehicles communication system in which IAVs can communicate and cooperate to avoid collision problem in the predetermined intersection areas in the yard. We investigate the performance of our solution through simulations using Omnet++/Veins Simulation framework.

Seminal literature argues that this problem is predominantly due to a myriad of issues, including high construction costs, skills shortages, the slow pace of construction, lack of infrastructure and logistics, poor quality of available housing stock etc. Given these issues, offsite manufacturing has been proffered as an innovative method for addressing these challenges. This paper reports on the findings of a substantial literature review investigated the needs, promises and barriers of adopting offsite manufacturing in Nigeria. Seminal literature elaborating on offsite construction and Nigerian construction industry has been thoroughly reviewed and results were analysed using thematic analysis, and Nvivo software was used to code and analyse the research data. Findings highlighted that the housing deficit in Nigeria is on the increase and nothing significant was being done at the moment. The results also posited that although OSM could improve housing delivery efforts in Nigeria, the prevalence of this is still considerably low; and that this was influenced by many factors, such as negative local perception about OSM, client resistance, lack of infrastructure and skills shortage. This study concludes that for OSM to be adopted in Nigeria, there is a need for greater awareness, collaboration, training and encouragement from Government. This study presents additional understanding of OSM in Nigeria based on expert opinion, the results of which were used to develop a framework for the effective adoption of OSM in Nigeria. It is concluded that the adoption of OSM could help support housing delivery efforts in Nigeria, and leverage wider benefits to the industry and associated supply chain.}

Every day, large quantities of car parts are sent from one factory to another, defining very large truck/container transportation problems. The main challenge faced by the Renault logistics platforms is to load the items into trucks and containers as efficiently as possible so as to minimize the number of vehicles sent. Therefore, the problem to be solved is a multicontainer loading problem in which, besides the usual geometric constraints preventing items from overlapping and exceeding the dimensions of the container, there are many other constraints, concerning the way in which items are put into layers, layers into stacks and stacks into containers, limiting the total weight and the weight supported by the items. In this paper we propose a GRASP algorithm, including constructive procedures to build solutions satisfying all the constraints, randomization strategies to produce diversity of solutions, and improvement moves to obtain high-quality solutions in short computing times. The algorithm has been tested on a set of real instances provided by the company and the results are competitive with the best results known, including some new improved solutions.}

These two compounds acted synergistically against human colon carcinoma HCT-116 xenograft tumor in athymic nude mice. In all, only 78 nude mice have been used. The synergy is especially significant (p<0.01–0.05) following Q3Dx4, x3 i.v. treatments, at higher doses and at later stages of treatment. The MEE and the CI theorem of Chou-Talalay quantitatively determined synergism or antagonism at different doses and different effect levels as indicated by the Fa-CI plot and by isobolograms in CompuSyn simulation and automated graphics. The practical logistics on pre-experimental planning, scheme/design/layout, and precautions in terms of dose number, dose range, dose density, drug combination ratio, conservation of laboratory animals as well as regulatory and cost-effective considerations have been presented.

The authors explore the rationale for participatory scenario planning within the science–policy interface with critical reference to the corporate context in which scenario planning has evolved. The aim is to optimise the potential for its use in the context of socio-technical and environmental governance. Researcher co-reflections on the case study are mapped within a matrix of indices representing conditions for ideal speech situations. Further analytical categories highlight the extent to which ideal speech was approximated. Although many of the constraints on achieving ideal speech situations reflect intransigent, practical logistics of organising participatory exercises, our novel approach enables the systematic identification of some important issues and provides a conceptual framework for understanding how they interrelate that may prove useful to practitioners and theorists alike.}

Perennial grasses as the “ideotype” of bioenergy crops, bioenergy chains involving perennial grasses, environmental sustainability, and future research perspectives to bring these species into cropping systems are also underlined. Perennial grasses are lignocellulosic, low-cost feedstock, able to grow in variegate environments and to thrive on marginal lands. They have been indicated as the leading candidate feedstock for the modern biobased economy to produce a number of high added-value products (i.e., biopharmaceuticals, nutrient supplements, biopolymers), biomaterials (i.e., buildings, phonic insulating, mulching and biodegradable products for gardening and animal bedding), energy carriers (advanced biofuels, heat and power), and by-products (i.e., soil organic fertilizers, green chemistry products). However, research is still needed in breeding, agronomy, postharvest logistics, and bioconversion to deliver new elite varieties to expand the European market and allow potential yield and desired biomass quality to be reached, while maximizing resources and conversion efficiencies.}

These relationships between the stakeholders of the economic sectors (transport, water, housing, energy, industry…) and the territories shaped by public action thus define the type of urban governance which results from interactions. In this paper, we develop the hypothesis that the relation between these stakeholders has a major impact on the mechanisms that produce the city. In this perspective, we apply an analytical framework (sector/territory dialogues) to two river cities in order to understand how the interplay between the stakeholders modifies urban geography. Analysing the relationship between the city, the river and the port in Venlo (The Netherlands) and Strasbourg (France) provides examples of project-based urban planning that is founded on negotiation between the river stakeholders (port authorities, inland waterway managers, transport and logistics firms) and the different levels of public policies (municipal, intermunicipal, regional, national levels). Eventually, this approach allows us to consider the forms taken by the above sector-territory dialogue within the urban space in terms of tools and scales. Finally, the paper ends with a discussion about the value of a contribution from geography to an understanding of these governance issues.}

One of several key issues is an emphasis on getting these therapies from bench to bedside without compromising safety and efficacy. The successful commercialization of cellular therapeutics will require many to extend the shelf-life of these therapies beyond shipping “fresh” at ambient or chilled temperatures for “just in time” infusion. Cryopreservation is an attractive option and offers potential advantages, such as storing and retaining patient samples in case of a relapse, banking large quantities of allogeneic cells for broader distribution and use and retaining testing samples for leukocyte antigen typing and matching. However, cryopreservation is only useful if cells can be reanimated to physiological life with negligible loss of viability and functionality. Also critical is the logistics of storing, processing and transporting cells in clinically appropriate packaging systems and storage devices consistent with quality and regulatory standards. Rationalized approaches to develop commercial-scale cell therapies require an efficient cryopreservation system that provides the ability to inventory standardized products with maximized shelf life for later on-demand distribution and use, as well as a method that is scientifically sound and optimized for the cell of interest. The objective of this review is to bridge this gap between the basic science of cryobiology and its application in this context by identifying several key aspects of cryopreservation science in a format that may be easily integrated into mainstream cell therapy manufacture.}

This part of the study focuses on analyzing the operation and performance of the two waste collection systems. The mixed collection system is shown to yield higher material separation rates, higher recycling rates, and lower contamination rates compared with the exclusive drop-off system, a result of the curbside component in the former system. However, the operational efficiency of the curbside collection in the mixed system is lower than the drop-off collection in the mixed system and the exclusive drop-off system, mainly because of inefficiency of collection. A key recommendation is to ensure that the systems should be optimized in an attempt to improve performance. Optimization should be applied not only to logistical aspects but also to citizens’ participation, which could be improved by conducting curbside collection awareness campaigns in the neighborhoods that have a mixed system.}

In practice, the delivery cost of a carton of items is usually retrieved from a cost table. The costs may not preserve any known mathematical function since it could specify arbitrary price at any possible weight. Such a general pricing scheme meets a majority of real-world bin packing applications, where the price of delivery service is determined by many complicated and correlated factors. Compared to the classical bin packing problem and its variants, the 2DVPP-GC is more complex and challenging. To solve the 2DVPP-GC with minimizing the total cost, we propose a memetic algorithm to compute solutions of high quality. Fitness functions and improved operators are proposed to achieve effectiveness. Computational experiments on a variety of test instances show that the algorithm is competent to solve the 2DVPP-GC. In particular, optimal solutions are found in a second for all the test instances that have a known optimal solution.}

Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is one of the most preventable non-communicable diseases in human. Identifying triggers of myocardial infarction (MI) and prevention ways of exposure-induced complications can reduce morbidity and mortality in people at risk.
Aim
The aim of this study was to identify the emotional, environmental, physical and chemical dimensions of acute triggers in patients with AMI.
Methods
This case-crossover study was conducted on 269 patients with AMI, hospitalized at two remedial centers in Rasht in 2015. The study samples were selected by convenient sampling method. Data were collected using researcher-made questionnaire through interviews. Hazard and control periods for each trigger and its effects on the development of MI were studied. The collected data were analyzed using descriptive and analytical statistical methods, Cochran test, and generalized estimating equation (GEE) model with logistics function default in SPSS version 21, and p<0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
The results showed that quarrel (P=0.008, OR=2.01) and hearing the sudden news (P=0.001, OR=2.19) were the most common emotional triggers. Respiratory infections (P=0.0001, OR=6.78) and exposure to hot or cold weather (P=0.005, OR=2.19) were the most frequent environmental triggers. Doing heavy activities (P=0.005, OR=1.66) and sexual activities (P=0.003, OR=2.36) were among the most common physical triggers. High-fat foods consumption and overeating (P=0.0001, OR=3.79) were the most frequent chemical triggers of AMI.
Conclusion
It seems that given the importance of the triggers in the incidence of AMI, planning is necessary to train vulnerable individuals to reduce exposure to triggers.}

These figures do not take into account the energy and carbon emissions due to production of building materials or for logistics and building construction. The demand for both energy and resources is soaring as global construction booms, especially in countries such as China and India. This means that developments in building practice can significantly contribute to tackling climate change and energy use. The use of ETFE foils as a new transparent material substitute for glass provides the potential for not only vast savings in material quantities but simultaneously makes possible a new type of space for living and working. The environmental benefits are presented as results of a comparative study between glass and ETFE solutions on two projects in Germany, Domaquarée in Berlin and Kapuzinergraben in Aachen, based on a life cycle analysis. The social benefits will be presented using the example of Kingsdale School in London and Kuwait Avenues, Kuwait. It will be shown that the introduction of ETFE foil systems in modern architecture will significantly contribute not only to environmental sustainability, but also create economic and social advantages compared to more classic building materials.}

This study investigates the material procurement and logistics measures for mitigating waste generated by construction activities. In a bid to explore the phenomenon from the perspectives of experts from the construction industry, this study used a combination of descriptive interpretive research and survey approach as its methodological framework. The study suggests that four features characterised waste efficient logistic and procurement process. These include suppliers' commitment to low waste measures, low waste purchase management, effective materials delivery management and waste efficient Bill of Quantity. In addition, the key requisite strategies for mitigating construction waste through materials procurement include commitment to take back scheme , procurement of waste efficient materials/technology and use of minimal packaging. The use of Just-in-Time (JIT) delivery system and prevention of over ordering are also important for mitigating waste through materials procurement processes. These implies that while the key measures are critical success factors for reducing waste through procurement process, the four established features are required of all procurement process. Measures through which the procurement process could enhance waste efficiency are further highlighted and discussed in the paper. Findings of this study could assist in understanding a set of measures that should be taken during materials procurement process, thereby corroborating waste management practices at design and construction stages of project delivery process.}

abstract = {Political and economic rapprochement is taking place between Russia and China in a number of fields: energy, arms production, trade in national currencies and strategic projects in transport and supporting infrastructure. This development, fostered by Western policies and actions, including sanctions related to Ukraine, appears to be strengthening despite reservations related to uneasy precedents, contrasting visions and uncertain economic projections. Chinese policies aiming at European markets via the revival of the Silk Road assist this development. The One Belt-One Road is projected as an alternative, or supplement, to the maritime routes made unsafe by contiguous countries' unrest, criminality and the assertive control of the seas by the United States. While Russia, promoting friendly investment structures, moves eastwards to develop the Russian Far East bordering China, the latter expands westwards engaging in laborious negotiations with Central Asian countries and costly investments in infrastructure and logistics. In each area, the article maintains that both countries, despite economic and political competition and fear of losing control, have interest in cooperation and discusses the areas where this is taking place, albeit slowly and with difficulty. Whether economic cooperation can develop into a strategic alliance including defence is discussed in the light of joint military exercises, arms trade and plans to broaden the scope of the Collective Security Treaty Organisation, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (of which India and Pakistan have recently become members), and the Common ASEAN Community. This path is difficult and marred by members' conflicting interests. But some positive outcomes should not be ruled out.}

We identified Southeast Asia, the Indian sub-continent, and the countries on the Arabian Sea as most probable source areas of 50 000 items on the shores of St. Brandon's Rock (SBR), Indian Ocean. 79% of the debris was plastics. Flip-flops, energy drink bottles, and compact fluorescent lights (CFLs) were notable item types. The density of debris (0.74 m−1 shore length) is comparable to similar islands but less than mainland sites. Intact CFLs suggests product-facilitated long-range transport of mercury. We suspect that aggregated marine debris, scavenged by the islands from currents and gyres, could re-concentrate pollutants. SBR islets accumulated debris types in different proportions suggesting that many factors act variably on different debris types. Regular cleaning of selected islets will take care of most of the accumulated debris and may improve the ecology and tourism potential. However, arrangements and logistics require more study.}

abstract = {This paper addresses a Green Time Dependent Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem that accounts for transportation emissions. The problem has been formulated and solved using Dynamic Programming approach. The applicability of Dynamic Programming in large sized problems is, however, limited due to exponential memory and computation time requirements. Therefore, we propose a generic heuristic approach, Simulation Based Restricted Dynamic Programming, based on weighted random sampling, the classical Restricted Dynamic Programming heuristic and simulation for the model to solve large sized instances. These decision support tools can be used to aid logistics decision-making processes in urban distribution planning. The added values of the proposed model and the heuristic have been shown based on a real life urban distribution planning problem between a pharmaceutical warehouse and a set of pharmacies, and ten relatively larger instances. The results of the numerical experiments show that the Simulation Based Restricted Dynamic Programming heuristic can provide promising results within relatively short computation times compared to the classical Restricted Dynamic Programming for the Green Time Dependent Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem. The Simulation Based Restricted Dynamic Programming algorithm yields 2.3% lower costs within 93.1% shorter computation times on average, compared to the classical Restricted Dynamic Programming. Moreover, the analyses on the effect of traffic congestion in our base case reveal that 2.3% benefit on total emissions and 0.9% benefit on total routing cost could be obtained if vehicles start delivery after heavy congested period is passed.}

The eutectic solutions shows a low melting temperature and high latent heat of fusion value as effect of addition nano copper powder into the eutectic solution. We report a new simulation technique of thermal property as well as test results of three inorganic salts. The thermal property of three inorganic salts were simulated using the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) method with the help of three binary phase diagrams. The simulation shows the liquidus temperature of each binary phase diagram conforming nicely to the theoretical prediction of the Gibbs-Duhem equation. In order to predict cold storage keeping time, we derived a heat transfer model based on energy conservation law. Three ESMs were tested for their cold energy storage performance and thermal properties aging for durability. The empirical results indicate that, for food cold chain, the melting point rule is superior with less deviation. With this information, one can pre-estimate the basic design parameters with great accuracy; the cost of design and development for a new cold storage logistics system can be dramatically reduced.}

To understand perceived barriers to providing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) education, implementation processes, and practices in high schools.
Study design
Iowa has required CPR as a graduation requirement since 2011 as an unfunded mandate. A cross-sectional study was performed through multiple choice surveys sent to Iowa high schools to collect data about school demographics, details of CPR programs, cost, logistics, and barriers to implementation, as well as automated external defibrillator training and availability.
Results
Eighty-four schools responded (26%), with the most frequently reported school size of 100-500 students and faculty size of 25-50. When the law took effect, 51% of schools had training programs already in place; at the time of the study, 96% had successfully implemented CPR training. Perceived barriers to implementation were staffing, time commitment, equipment availability, and cost. The average estimated startup cost was <$1000 US, and the yearly maintenance cost was <$500 with funds typically allocated from existing school resources. The facilitator was a school official or volunteer for 81% of schools. Average estimated training time commitment per student was <2 hours. Automated external defibrillators are available in 98% of schools, and 61% include automated external defibrillator training in their curriculum.
Conclusions
Despite perceived barriers, school CPR training programs can be implemented with reasonable resource and time allocations.}

abstract = {Summary
Background & aims
The existence of enhanced recovery specific guidelines (ERAS) is not enough to change patient management practice since many barriers exist to successful ERAS implementation. The present survey aimed to analyse motivations for implementation as well as encountered difficulties and challenges. Further, relevance and importance of perioperative care items and postoperative recovery targets were assessed.
Methods
A multicentre qualitative study was conducted between August and December 2016 among surgeons, anaesthesiologists and nurses from implemented ERAS centres in Switzerland (n = 16) and Sweden (n = 14). An online survey (31 closed questions) was sent by email, with reminders at 4, 8 and 12 weeks.
Results
Seventy-seven out of 146 experts completed the survey (response rate 52.7%). Main motivations to implement ERAS were the expectation to reduce complications (91%), higher patient satisfaction (73%) and shorter hospital stay (62%). The application of ERAS program represented major changes in clinical practice for 57% of participants without significant differences between various specialities (surgeons: 63%, nurses: 63%, anaesthesiologists: 36%, p = 0.185). The most important barriers for straightforward implementation were time restraints (69%), opposing colleagues (68%) and logistical reasons (66%). The 3 most frequently cited patient-related barriers to adopt ERAS were opposing personality (52%), co-morbidities (49%) and language barriers (31%).
Conclusions
Implementing ERAS care into practice was challenging and required important changes in clinical practice for all involved specialities. Main reasons for implementation were the expectation to reduce complications and hospital stay with improved patients' satisfaction. Main barriers were time restraints, reluctance to change and logistics.}
