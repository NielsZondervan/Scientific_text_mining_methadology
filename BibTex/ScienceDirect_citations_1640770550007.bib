abstract = {Blood safety is a non-negotiable issue worldwide, specifies the World Health Organization (WHO). Africa is both an entity and a multiplicity of situations within and cross-borders. Indeed, most African countries have recent borders and political organizations, after gaining independence in the 60's. Many such countries have maintained various types of links and cooperation programs with former European countries of influence, e.g. France and Belgium among others, which is the case for several countries from the francophone Central and West Africa. Besides, borders do not delineate ethnic groups as many of them migrate, with spread North to South and East to West across several countries, each having representations, ethnologically speaking. Transfusion is an essential supportive healthcare that requires medicine, technicity and logistics. Cooperation can be provided to Francophone Africa though at the expense of recruiting donors upon criteria that do not completely overlap with e.g. those put forward in France and other high-income countries, despite WHO claims for the universal model of Voluntary Non-Remunerated Blood Donation system. Next, the patient profile in intertropical Africa—of which the various francophone African countries—stringently differs from the profile now seen in France, with its younger (but strongly social network-connected) populations and the importance of anemia of all causes but frequently infectious in nature. The frequency of antigens defining blood groups also significantly differs from that in France and the rest of Europa. Last, the carriage of blood transmissible infectious pathogens in sick but also apparently healthy populations seriously complicates the build up of suitable blood component inventory. In the present review, we discuss the universality of blood donation, the specificities of inter-continent cooperation and report on experiences of such cooperation. The French Blood Establishment EFS has taken over earlier initiatives of regional blood services and provides technology and scientific transfer and support to many countries for several decades; the National Institute for Blood transfusion, an education and research institute, has set up collaborative research in several domains but mostly in the domain of blood transmissible infections. We next also present a theoretical view of support named ALEASE, that can be pursued, based on collaborative experiences carried out in the Mediterranean Northern and Eastern areas. ALEASE promotes benchmark between participants. If there is general agreement that cooperation between economically wealthy countries and low-income, developing, countries in the domain of blood and blood transfusion safety, promotion of blood donation, blood component manufacturing, transfusion technology, hemovigilance, etc., tools to achieve this goal can be periodically reviewed based on specific needs for countries and professionals. That also comprise of adapted, sometimes specific, education programs.}

With economic development, travel demands and logistics demands will continue to rise in China. To solve the associated problems, policies related to electric vehicle (EV) promotion and fuel economy regulations are being adopted by the state government. Six scenarios, based on different policies, are analyzed to calculate vehicle fleet GHG emissions in this research by developing a bottom-up modeling framework from a life-cycle perspective. When only fuel economy regulations are considered, GHG emissions from the road transport sector will reach their peak in 2047. However, combined with EV deployment, the peak will arrive earlier, in 2026. In the short term, more stringent fuel economy regulations exhibit better results. Without EVs, fuel economy regulations will be tougher for corporations to meet than with the introduction of EVs. However, in the long term, with a higher proportion of EVs, GHG emissions will further decrease. In addition, the introduction of EVs will weaken the effects of fuel economy regulations, especially for passenger vehicles, due to credit policies. The lack of EVs in the commercial vehicle fleet will impart more significance to the fuel economy regulations. Commercial vehicles, particularly trucks, will account for the majority of GHG emissions by the whole vehicle fleet. In brief, the government should persistently focus on the fuel economy regulations to achieve an early and relatively low-level peak in vehicle fleet GHG emissions. Meanwhile, the promotion of EVs will have the long-term effect of de-carbonization. In addition, more effective measures should be taken to reduce the truck GHG emissions.}

abstract = {ABSTRACT
Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is an effective treatment for many hematologic malignancies, and its utilization continues to rise. However, due to the difficult logistics and high cost of HCT, there are significant barriers to accessing the procedure; these barriers are likely greater for older patients. Although numerous factors may influence HCT access, no formal analysis has detailed the cumulative barriers that have been studied thus far. We conducted a systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines to better categorize the barriers to access and referral to HCT, with a focus on the subgroup of older patients. We searched for articles published in English from PubMed, Embase, Cumulative Index for Nursing and Allied Health, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials between the database inception and January 31, 2020. We selected articles that met the following inclusion criteria: (1) study design: qualitative, cross-sectional, observational cohort, or mixed-method study designs; (2) outcomes: barriers related to patient and physician access to HCT; and (3) population: adults aged ≥18 years with hematologic malignancies within the United States. Abstracts without full text were excluded. QUALSYST methodology was used to determine article quality. Data on the barriers to access and referral for HCT were extracted, along with other study characteristics. We summarized the findings using descriptive statistics. We included 26 of 3859 studies screened for inclusion criteria. Twenty studies were retrospective cohorts and 4 were cross-sectional. There was 1 prospective cohort study and 1 mixed-method study. Only 1 study was rated as high quality, and 16 were rated as fair. Seventeen studies analyzed age as a potential barrier to HCT referral and access, with 16 finding older age to be a barrier. Other consistent barriers to HCT referral and access included nonwhite race (n = 16/20 studies), insurance status (n = 13/14 studies), comorbidities (n = 10/11 studies), and lower socioeconomic status (n = 7/8 studies). High-quality studies are lacking related to HCT barriers. Older age and nonwhite race were consistently linked to reduced access to HCT. To produce a more just health care system, strategies to overcome these barriers for vulnerable populations should be prioritized. Examples include patient and physician education, as well as geriatric assessment guided care models that can be readily incorporated into clinical practice.}

abstract = {Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining (ASM) landscapes form integral part of the Land use land cover (LULC) in the developing worlds. However, the spatial, spectral, and temporal footprints of ASM present some challenges for using most of the freely available optical satellite sensors for change analysis. The challenge is even profound in tropical West African countries like Ghana where there is prolonged cloud cover. Whiles very few studies have used Sentinel-2 data to map change analysis in ASM landscape, none examined the contribution of individual S2 bands to the ASM classifications. Also, despite the capabilities of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models for LULC classifications, few studies have compared the performances of different classifiers in mapping ASM landscape. This study utilized Sentinel-2 data, four ML and DL models (Artificial Neural Network –ANN, Random Forest – RF, Support Vector Machines –SVM, a pixel-based Convolutional Neural Network-CNN) and image segmentation to examine the performance of S2 bands and ML and DL algorithms for change analysis in ASM landscape, with the Birim Basin in Ghana as a study area. The result of the change analysis was used to assess changes in LULC during the recent ban on the expansion of ASM in the country. It was found out that ANN is a better classifier of ASM achieving the highest overall accuracy (OA) of 99.80% on the segmented Sentinel-2 bands. The study also found out that the Band 5 Vegetation Red Edge (VRE) 1 contributed most to classifying ASM, with the segmented VRE 1 being superlative over the other predictors. In terms of expansion, ASM increased by 59.17 km2 within the period of the study (January 2017 to December 2018), suggesting that ASM still took place under the watch of the ban. The classification results showed that most of the peripheral of forest and farmland have been converted to ASM with little disturbance within the interior of the forest reserves. The study revealed that, the ban was yielding very little or no results due to a number of policy deficiencies including low staff strength, lack of logistics and low remuneration. Enforcement of legal instruments against ASM and farming activities within the forest reserves, improvement in the monitoring systems and intensification of public education on the value of forest and the need to protect it are some of the major recommendations that could control encroachment on the forest reserves.}

abstract = {Objectives
The objective of this study was to describe the fertility intentions of urban working women whose family planning has been limited to one child since the universal two-child policy was adopted and to explore factors associated with intentions to not have a second child.
Study design
This is a cross-sectional study.
Methods
This study was conducted among 703 urban working women with one child using a self-administered questionnaire from May to August 2016 in Hunan, China. Data were collected on the women's sociodemographic characteristics, attitudes towards having another child and fertility intentions. A descriptive analysis, chi-square test and logistics regression were used for data analysis.
Results
The ideal number of children among the urban working women was 2.03 ± 0.35. Fewer than half (32.4%) of working women with one child clearly intended to have another child. Not having another child was independently associated with family type, husband's age, age of the first child, attitude of the husband and parents-in-law, whether the parents-in-law provided economic support and the influence of friends. Participants showed lower second-child intentions with increasing age of the partner and first child (P value = 0.002, 0.026). Participants whose parents-in-law provided economic support were less likely to not want a second child than those whose parents-in-law did not provide economic support (P value = 0.037). Those with husbands and parents-in-law with supportive attitudes were less likely to not want another child (P value = 0.001, 0.022). Participants whose friends positively influenced them to have another child were less likely to intend to not have another child (P value = 0.000).
Conclusions
There is no guarantee that the universal two-child policy will be enough to prompt an increase in fertility among urban working women with one child in Hunan Province. Supplementary measures are urgently needed to create a favourable environment for childbearing in China.}

abstract = {Background
Type 2 diabetes mellitus is closely related to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease(NAFLD). More and more attention has been paid to the efficacy of liraglutide in the treatment of NAFLD, but the clinical evidence is still insufficient.
Objective
The purpose of this study was to use proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-MRS) assessment of metformin alone poor blood glucose control of obese patients type 2 diabetes with NAFLD, added with insulin glargine, liraglutide or placebo effect in improving the fatty liver.
Methods
This is a 26-week, single-center, prospective, randomized placebo-controlled study. From September 2016 to July 2018, 128 patients with type 2 diabetes and NAFLD were enrolled in the China joint logistics team 900 hospital. The primary endpoints were the changes in intrahepatic content of lipid (IHCL), abdominal adiposity [subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT)], from baseline to week 26 (end of treatment) and the changes in liraglutide group or insulin glargine group versus change in placebo group. Secondary endpoints included the changes in liver function (AST and ALT), glycemia (HbA1c and FPG), body weight, and BMI.
Results
A total of 96 patients with type 2 diabetes and NAFLD under inadequate glycemic control by metformin were randomized (1:1:1) to receive add-on insulin glargine, liraglutide, or placebo. After 26 weeks of treatment, compared to the placebo group, in the liraglutide and insulin glargine groups, IHCL significantly decreased from baseline to week 26 (liraglutide 26.4% ± 3.2% to 20.6% ± 3.9%, P < 0.05; insulin glargine 25.0% ± 4.3% to 22.6% ± 5.8%, P > 0.05). SAT and VAT decreased significantly in the liraglutide group and in the insulin glargine group (P < 0.05). ΔSAT and ΔVAT were greater with liraglutide than insulin glargine, they were significantly different between the two groups (ΔSAT, −36 vs. − 24.5, P < 0.05; and ΔVAT, −47 vs. − 16.6, P > 0.05). In the liraglutide group, AST, ALT, and HOMA-IR decreased significantly from baseline. There was no significant difference in glucose-lowering among the three groups. During the treatment, the safety of the three groups performed well.
Conclusion
Compared with placebo, treatment with liraglutide plus an adequate dose of metformin (2000 g/ day) for 26 weeks is more effective in reducing IHCL, SAT and VAT in patients with type 2 diabetes and NAFLD. And it has additional advantages in weight loss, waist circumference reduction and liver function improvement.}

However, the fact that parental consent needs to be obtained remotely adds complexity to the process and can have a detrimental effect on vaccine uptake. We conducted a multiple methods analysis to examine the practice of obtaining informed consent in adolescent immunisation programmes. This involved a thematic analysis of consent related data from 39 interviews with immunisation managers and providers collected as part of a 2017 service evaluation of the English adolescent girls’ HPV vaccine programme and a descriptive statistical analysis of data from questions related to consent included in a 2017 survey of parents’ and adolescents’ attitudes to adolescent vaccination. The findings indicated that the non-return of consent forms was a significant logistical challenge for immunisation teams, and some were piloting opt-out consent mechanisms, increasing the proportion of adolescents consenting for their own immunisations, and introducing electronic consent. Communicating vaccine related information to parents and schools and managing uncertainties about obtaining adolescent self-consent for vaccination were the main practical challenges encountered. Survey data showed that parents and adolescents generally agreed on vaccine decisions although only 32% of parents discussed vaccination with their teenager. Parental awareness about the option for adolescents to self-consent for vaccination was limited and adolescents favoured leaving the decision-making to parents. From the interviews and variability of consent forms it was evident that health professionals were not always clear about the best way to manage the consent process. Some were also unfamiliar with self-consent processes and lacked confidence in assessing for ‘Gillick competency’. Developing pathways and related interventions to improve the logistics and practice of consent in school-based adolescent immunisation programmes could help improve uptake.}

As a transition solution, which can be implemented on much shorter term; this study presents the technical and economic evaluation for ship-based carbon capture (SBCC) on diesel or LNG-fuelled vessels. Two reference ship engines of 1280 kW and 3000 kW were chosen. The process is simulated using Aspen Plus®, with 30 wt% aqueous monoethanolamine (MEA) and 30 wt% aqueous piperazine (PZ) as solvents. CAPEX and OPEX were reduced by integrating the thermal energy of the exhaust gas with the stripper reboiler for the diesel and LNG powered ships. For the LNG ships, the cooling capacity from evaporation of LNG was used for liquefying the captured CO2. By using piperazine, which allows CO2 to be desorbed at higher pressure than MEA, the minimal cost of CO2 captured achieved was 98 €/tonne CO2 with a corresponding 1.8 million euros equipment cost for the 3000 kW engine ship. Additionally, the feasibility of SBCC is investigated by adapting an existing cargo ship design (powered by the reference 3000 kW engine) for including the carbon capture process equipment. The capture, compression and storage units are fitted onboard, and the design is modified so that the transport capacity remains the same, while maintaining the ship stability.}

Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) is a well-established mass-spectrometric method that can be used for reproducible protein-concentration measurements in biological specimens collected via microsampling. The dried blood spot (DBS) microsampling technique can be performed non-invasively without the expertise of a phlebotomist, and can enhance analyte stability which facilitate the application of this technique in retrospective studies while providing lower storage and shipping costs, because cold-chain logistics can be eliminated. Thus, precise, sensitive, and multiplexed methods for measuring protein concentrations in DBSs can be used for de novo biomarker discovery and for biomarker quantification or verification experiments. To achieve this goal, MRM assays were developed for multiplexed concentration measurement of proteins in DBSs. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was found to have a median total coefficient of variation (CV) of 18% for 245 proteins, whereas the median LLOQ was 5 fmol of peptide injected on column, and the median inter-day CV over 4 days for measuring endogenous protein concentration was 8%. The majority (88%) of the assays displayed parallelism, whereas the peptide standards remained stable throughout the assay workflow and after exposure to multiple freeze-thaw cycles. For 190 proteins, the measured protein concentrations remained stable in DBS stored at ambient laboratory temperature for up to 2 months. Finally, the developed assays were used to measure the concentration ranges for 200 proteins in twenty same sex, same race and age matched individuals.}

Large amounts of information are provided to applicants during the residency interview process. It is important to share this information in an efficient, environmentally sound, and engaging manner. Preparing information packets requires significant administrative time and results in discarded paper or unused flash-drives. OBJECTIVE We sought to eliminate paper documents, minimize administrative effort, and streamline communication during interview season.
Methods
With the assistance of LegitApps Company we designed an app for Android and Apple devices that allows us to communicate in real time with applicants. The app delivers all required documentation prior to the applicant's arrival. It provides interview day schedule details and logistics, maps to their specific pre-interview dinner, and helps with navigating our city (finding hotels, identifying places to eat, highlighting fun things to do, etc). An easy to complete interview day survey is automatically pushed to all applicants at the end of the day. After initial programming, only minimal maintenance was needed by our administrative staff throughout the season.
Results
The app was downloaded 522 times this season. Based on results from the end-of-the-day survey, almost all 353 applicants downloaded the app. They appreciated the streamlined communication and hub for information. They used it to find Uber rides, book hotels, explore the city, and to prepare for their interview day. By eliminating paper, we saved money and manpower, allowing our staff to dedicate their time to the applicant experience. Survey comments include: “I appreciated the UM Pediatrics App, as it made the resources easy to access and reference throughout the day” and “I liked the App and that you tried to save some trees and not print out all of the information.”
Conclusion
The app successfully conveyed information efficiently to applicants and decreasing the administrative workload. We plan to expand the app to include our fellowship programs and are working with other programs at our institution to develop similar apps for their programs.}

abstract = {With growing consumer demand and expectations, companies are attempting to achieve cost-efficient and faster delivery operations. The integration of autonomous vehicles, such as drones, in the last-mile network design can curtail many operational challenges and provide a competitive advantage. This paper deals with the problem of delivering orders to a set of customer locations using multiple drones that operate in conjunction with a single truck. To take advantage of the drone fleet, the delivery tasks are parallelized by concurrently dispatching the drones from a truck parked at a focal point (ideal drone launch location) to the nearby customer locations. Hence, the key decisions to be optimized are the partitioning of delivery locations into small clusters, identifying a focal point per cluster, and routing the truck through all focal points such that the customer orders in each cluster are fulfilled either by a drone or truck. In contrast to prior studies that tackle this problem using multi-phase sequential procedures, this paper presents mathematical programming models to jointly optimize all the decisions involved. We also consider two polices for choosing a cluster focal point - (i) restricting it to one of the customer locations, and (ii) allowing it to be anywhere in the delivery area (i.e., a customer or non-customer location). Since the models considering unrestricted focal points are computationally expensive, an unsupervised machine learning-based heuristic algorithm is proposed to accelerate the solution time. Initially, we treat the problem as a single objective by independently minimizing either the total cost or delivery completion time. Subsequently, the two conflicting objectives are considered together for obtaining the set of best trade-off solutions. An extensive computational study is conducted to investigate the impacts of restricting the focal points, and the influence of adopting a joint optimization method instead of a sequential approach. Finally, several key insights are obtained to aid the logistics practitioners in decision making.}

abstract = {This study aims to evaluate the environmental sustainability of a new street food format for food service based on the re-use of naval shipping containers and to compare it with the conventional one (street food truck). The environmental impact analysis was performed using the Life Cycle Assessment methodology. The functional unit (FU) was identified in the food service, including three food preparations: a dish of pasta (100 g), one sandwich (150 g) and one portion of fries (200 g). Following a “from cradle to gate” approach, the factors studied are: (i) the customization of a shipping container in a street food format, (ii) the construction and use of the cooking appliance, (iii) the logistics, (iv) the cooking phase (including final packaging as food cup). The life cycle of ingredients for food preparations has been neglected due to the variability of the products. The results show that the two higher hotspots are electricity consumed by cooking appliance (35%) and oil used to fry (34%), attributable only to the fries preparation. The third hotspot is imputable to the customized structure, with an average percentage value equal to 15%. Considering the global warming impact category, the customization into a street food format release 1280 kg CO2eq, while the production of a new container or a new street food truck format implies the emission of 12,800 kg CO2eq and 20,900 kg CO2eq respectively. The impact of the customized container (re-used container) weight for 0.04 kg CO2eq/FU, this value increases 11.6 times for a new container street food format, and 17 times for a new street food truck format. Overall, quantifying the environmental damage, the results showed how the re-use of a naval shipping container can be a way to reduce the environmental impact of food preparation, avoiding dismissing or building activity of the structure reducing the impact of the structure of about 95% offering a more sustainable street food services.}

abstract = {Purpose
Donor shortage remains a major obstacle associated with considerable mortality in patients waiting for lung transplantation (LTx). Objective donor lung assessment is crucial to obtain sufficient grafts of acceptable quality. We hypothesized that out of body chest CT may be an innovative way to assess grafts prior to LTx. Therefore, this study prospectively investigated the value of CT scan of donor lungs prior to LTx.
Methods
Between 12/2016 and 01/2018, all potential donor lungs were inspected in-situ, recovered and ex situ CT scanned during standard cold preservation. The transplant team and radiologist were blinded for the CT scan, which thus did not change the decision to transplant. CTs were scored for CT abnormalities and were compared between transplanted (Tx) and non-Tx grafts. In addition, CT of Tx grafts were compared between recipients developing PGD3 within 72 h (‘PGD3’) and recipients who did not (‘No PGD3’).
Results
In total, 75 lungs were transplanted and 25 were not transplanted, of which 19 were declined for poor graft quality and 6 for extrapulmonary malignancies or logistics. CT abnormalities (CSL, GGO, EMPHY) differed between Tx and non-Tx grafts (Figure 1A). In lungs declined for poor graft quality (n=19), the reason for decline was confirmed in 13 lungs, however 4 lungs had only limited CT abnormalities present. In 2 out of 7 lungs declined at retrieval for clinical suspicion of emphysema, no emphysema was present on CT. In addition, CT abnormalities (CSL, RET/IST) of Tx grafts also significantly differed between recipients with PGD 3 and without PGD 3 (Fig 1B).
Conclusion
Ex situ CT imaging of donor grafts during preservation is feasible and demonstrated significant differences between Tx and non-Tx grafts. Also grafts of patients with or without PGD3 differed in CT parameters. CT imaging could not confirm the reason for decline in 6 lungs, which might indicate an undisclosed graft potential and a role of CT imaging in donor assessment. The prognostic value of CT parameters on long-term outcomes remains elusive.}

abstract = {Because of their principle capability to non-invasively detect dangerous water bodies and water-filled decompaction zones, underground magnetic resonance sounding (MRS) measurement are expected to have a great potential for the safety of underground facilities. However, a general applicability of underground MRS is questionable. The small antenna sizes reduce the sensitive volume and thus the signal-to-noise ratio. Additionally, the receivers must be installed in the nearest vicinity (i.e. reactive near field) of electromagnetic (EM) noise-emitting installations necessary for the logistics and safety inside the tunnels. This study focusses on the characterisation of underground EM noise characteristics including their spatial and temporal variability as well as proper strategies for noise cancellation. Passive EM measurements using conventional MRS equipment were conducted in the rock laboratory of Mont Terri, Switzerland. The reference-based noise cancellation (RNC) method yielded the best performance, given that all orthogonal spatial components of the noise field were considered and combined on the remote multi-component reference antenna. The multiple coherence between the primary and the reference channels is highest and stable against temporal and spatial noise variations, if the reference antenna combines square and figure-of-eight coils. Using a primary figure-of-eight coil, final noise levels of <0.1 nV/m2 were achieved after a common averaging time. An MRS noise level at this magnitude allows the detection of non-clay-bound and therefore dangerous water deposits inside the shale formation. This is demonstrated with data from a surface MRS experiment in an urban test area, which exhibits similar noise characteristics as the Mont-Terri rock laboratory. Under such conditions, the underground MRS method would be able to provide at least a yes/no criterion for further activities to maintain on-site safety. Future research should focus on strategies for a data acquisition that allow at least a rough 3-D mapping of potential water reservoirs.}

abstract = {Objectives
As the risk of a recurrent neurological event in patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis requiring carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is highest in the early phase after the first neurological event, guidelines recommend operating on these patients as soon as possible or at least within 14 days of their initial event. However, in real world practice this is often not met. The aim of this study is to identify factors that cause hospital dependent delay to CEA.
Methods
All consecutive patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis undergoing CEA registered in the mandatory Dutch Audit for Carotid Interventions from January 2014 up to and including December 2017 were included in the current analysis. Univariable followed by multivariable logistic regression was used to identify independent factors associated with hospital dependent waiting time, defined as time from the first consultation at any hospital to CEA of more than 14 days.
Results
A total of 8620 patients were included. The median time to CEA was 11 days (IQR 8–14). Seventy-eight per cent of patients underwent CEA within 14 days of first hospital consultation. Factors associated with a hospital dependent waiting time longer than 14 days were age (OR 0.99 per year, 95% CI 0.98–0.99), any previous CEA (OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.32–2.09), ocular symptoms as index event (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.15–1.50), and indirect referral (OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.34–1.73). Hospital surgical volume was not identified as a factor for delay, except for the delay of indirectly referred patients where high volume hospitals reported the shortest delay.
Conclusion
This cohort derived from a validated nationwide prospective audit identified younger age, previous CEA, ocular symptoms, and indirect referral as hospital dependent factors for delay. High volume hospitals had a similar hospital dependent waiting time to middle and low volume hospitals. However, high volume hospitals had more indirect referrals, implying that their logistics are more efficiently organised.}

The nutrient content of the drainage water can be obtained directly from water analysis, which immediately focuses attention on filter media selection. There are many factors that may be important before choosing a medium or media e.g. nutrient removal capacity, lifetime, hydraulic conductivity, the potential for “pollution swapping”, attenuation of non-target contaminants (e.g. pesticides, organic carbon, etc.), and local availability and transportation cost of media to site. In this study, a novel decision support tool (DST) was developed, which brought all these factors together in one place for five nutrient scenarios. A systematic literature review was conducted to create a database containing 75 media with an associated static scoring system across seven criteria (% of nutrient concentration reduction, removal of other pollutants, lifetime, hydraulic conductivity, negative externalities) and a dynamic scoring system across two criteria (delivery cost and availability). The DST was tested using case studies from Ireland, Belgium and USA with different agricultural practices and nutrient scenarios. It was then validated by SWOT (strength, weakness, opportunities and threats) analysis. The DST provided a rapid, easily modifiable screening of many media-based treatments for specific dual or single nutrient-based water drainage problems. This provides stakeholders (farmers/regulators/advisors) with a versatile, flexible and robust yet easy-to-understand framework to make informed choices on appropriate media-based mitigation measures according to users’ relevant technical, economic and logistical factors.}

Carbon dioxide (CO2) traps and acaricides are commonly deployed as control measures, although with some disadvantages such as high costs, challenging logistics and vertebrate intoxication. Semiochemicals have the potential to improve tick attraction to traps and monitoring devices and alleviate the burden of A. sculptum infestations. Four concentrations (10, 5, 2.5 and 1.25 %) of 13 semiochemical candidates (CO2 only at 5 % as the standard, benzaldehyde, benzoic acid, salicylic acid, 2,6 diclorophenol, R-limonene, S-limonene, methyl salicylate, 1-octen-3-ol, acetone, ammonium hydroxide, isobutyric acid and lactic acid) were tested on unfed A. sculptum nymphs and adults using a Y-tube olfactometer to evaluated repellence and attraction behaviors. All stages tested were attracted to CO2, whereas nymphs were repelled by benzaldehyde and R-limonene, both at 10 %, and isobutyric acid at 5 and 10 %. Nymphs were attracted by methyl salicylate, benzoic acid and salicylic acid, all at 1.25 %, and by ammonium hydroxide at 2.5 %. Males were attracted by benzoic acid at 2.5 %, while females were repelled by benzaldehyde at 5 %. Mixtures with the attractive compounds achieved no attraction response. The compounds that caused attractiveness in the olfactometer assay (CO2, methyl salicylate, benzoic acid, salicylic acid and ammonium hydroxide) were placed randomly in traps in a grassland plot naturally infested with A. sculptum in triplicate. Notably, dry ice (CO2) remained the best at luring ticks in the field (P < 0.001). Benzoic acid should be further investigated since attractant activity was strongly confirmed in both laboratory and field tests. On the other hand, isobutyric acid and R-limonene could be better exploited due to their repellent role revealed by the lab assay, which makes them worthwhile molecules as natural repellents for the management of this tick.}

These among other factors directly affect the plant's performance measures such as availability, repair time and costs. Consequently, optimization addresses such challenges. However, a fundamental problem presented here relates to the need for a framework that assists in the determination of critical system to be optimized, variables that significantly impact the performance of such systems, and subsequently undertake optimization. To realistically model such complexities, a framework that applies the discrete simulation model of critical repairable subsystems, undergoing deterioration is proposed. The study utilises empirical maintenance data, where Pareto analysis is employed to identify critical subsystems, while expert input is incorporated to derive model variables. A full factorial Design of Experiment (DOE), is employed to establish the variables with significant main and interaction effects on the total repair time and subsequently employed as decision variables for a simulation-based optimization. The proposed framework is demonstrated in a case study of a thermal power plant. Simulation results highlight the turbocharger as the critical subsystem, while spares availability, the time between overhaul (TBO) and reliance on different maintenance strategies exhibit most significant main and interaction effects. The optimization results obtained demonstrate that TBO, spares availability and reliance on various maintenance strategies, provide a significant impact on the reduction of the repair time. The framework enhances maintenance decision making by optimizing the plants' operational and maintenance related factors identified.}

The complexity in these regions arises from variable topographic conditions, while the difficulty is finding a solution for multiple, sometimes conflicting, objectives, which requires that many sources of information are incorporated into the decision. These normally involve large volumes of data and analyses, which have been mostly carried out manually in most countries. As a result, the effectiveness and efficiencies of the decisions implemented are limited. To overcome difficulties, the current study firstly reviewed the most often used geospatial multicriteria decision system capabilities of Geographical Information System and R platform, and secondly, introduced the development of an integrative approach that combined spatial analysis with a multicriteria decision system to find feasible zones in which harvest operations can be conducted, and locate logistics possibilities for ground-based skidding operations in a subjective way without including monetary assessments. According to the harvest feasibility map, 50.82% of the total area is identified as feasible zones for the planning of timber harvest operations, of which 68.30% are allocated to the use of mechanized harvesting systems. The animal system is the preferred system on 32.24% of the total area characterized by steep-slope zones. The method also identified 55 sites with a variable area as suitable zones for a wood-yard terminal, of which 33 sites are nominated and evaluated using a compromise programming approach.

From a 5-year, [funding blinded] grant about impacts of graphic warning labels on tobacco products, three separate means of recruiting low-SES adult smokers emerged: 1) in person in the field with a mobile lab vehicle, 2) in person in the field with tablet computers, and 3) online via Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). We compared each of these methods in terms of the resulting participant demographics and the “pros” and “cons” of each approach including quality control, logistics, cost, and engagement. Field-based methods (with a mobile lab or in person with a tablet) yielded a greater proportion of disadvantaged participants who could be biochemically verified as current smokers—45% of the field-based sample had an annual income of <$10,000 compared to 16% of the MTurk sample; 40–45% of the field-based sample did not complete high school compared to 2.6% of the MTurk sample. MTurk-based recruitment was substantially less expensive to operate (1/14th the cost of field-based methods) was faster, and involved less logistical coordination, though was unable to provide immediate biochemical verification of current smoking status. Both MTurk and field-based methods provide access to low-SES participants–the difference is the proportion and the degree of disadvantage. For research and interventions where either inclusion considerations or external validity with low-SES populations is critical, especially the most disadvantaged, our research supports the use of field-based methods. It also highlights the importance of adequate funding and time to enable the recruitment and participation of these harder-to-reach populations.}

Within 120 min, the adsorption capacity of MEG for eutectic salt is 75.33% higher than that of unmodified expanded graphite (EG). The composite PCM has a phase change temperature of −5.30 °C, a large latent heat of 161.8 kJ kg−1, and a low supercooling degree of 1.83 °C. The thermal conductivity of the composite PCM is 13.3 times as large as that of the eutectic salt. Moreover, the thermal cycle tests demonstrated excellent thermal reliability. These outstanding thermal properties endow K2HPO4·3H2O–NaH2PO4·2H2O–Na2S2O3·5H2O–H2O eutectic salt/MEG composite PCM with broad application prospects in the fields of beer industry, air conditioning refrigeration, refrigerator refrigeration and cold chain logistics.}

The approach streamlines the traditional Techno-Economic Assessment (TEA), while introduces new evaluation factors in the areas of life cycle analysis, green house emission, sustainable goals, logistics, manufacturing, etc. Therefore, the proposed framework would provide comprehensive evaluations especially for the novel sustainable processes with the environmental or social merits, and compare with the traditional ones under the same platform. To show the efficiency of the approach, three process technologies are evaluated including (1) traditional Haber–Bosch ammonia synthesis, (2) large scale water electrolysis for ammonia synthesis, and (3) distributed wind-based water electrolysis for ammonia synthesis. An insight evaluation and analysis have been provided with sound comparison and optimal design under the proposed MOMT framework.}

The fuzzy method introduces another way of thinking: a statement, instead of being true or false, may be partially true or false. Thus, instead of taking into account the typically used fixed numerical values (such as, e.g., 2.34), the fuzzy method employs a set of plausible values (e.g., around the value 2.34) within a specific domain. Although this approach may look similar to the error of statistical methods, the fuzzy method can tackle situations (such as missing or vague data), for which classic methods are inefficient. The principles of fuzzy numbers, fuzzy sets, and fuzzy logic are presented. The case of symmetric triangular fuzzy numbers is analyzed in detail. Next, linear regression analysis with the use of fuzzy numbers is explained. A detailed application of fuzzy linear regression for a transport demand problem is surveyed analytically. The chapter includes many applications of fuzzy linear regression for the forecast of a variety of transport demand problems: air transport, rail transport, road transport, transport at urban level, and transport economics. Applications of the fuzzy method to other transport problems are explained: route choice, road safety, accident analysis, logistics and routing of freight vehicles, and the optimization of capacity of airports.}

Under similar environmental conditions, N. cochenillifera usually presents greater dry matter (DM), water-soluble carbohydrates, and in vitro digestible organic matter concentrations, and lesser crude protein (CP) when compared with O. ficus-indica. The planting density also affects cactus growth and its chemical composition: a greater plant N concentration was observed in a population of 5000 plants/ha (11.2 g/ kg) compared to a population of 40,000 plants/ha (9.0 g/kg). Young cladodes are present in greater proportions in less dense plant populations, presenting greater nutrient concentration and lesser DM than older cladodes. Fertilizer application also affects the chemical composition. Nitrogen fertilization increased cladode N concentration (ranging from 6.7 g/kg to 13.9 g/kg) in Opuntia ficus-indica, with a positive linear response (0 up to 300 kg N/ha/year) occurring in three out of four locations in NE Brazil. The harvest management may affect the nutritive value, as a reduced harvest intensity will increase the proportion of younger cladodes. However, as cactus maintains its nutritive value for a longer period compared to other forages, the harvest frequency has little influence on overall nutritive value. Cladodes may be stored in a dry and shaded location without losing its nutritive value for at least two weeks, which may facilitate the logistics of transportation, reducing the total costs. Therefore, this review provides an overview of how agronomic and environmental factors affect the chemical composition and nutritive value of cacti with the potential to improve livestock productivity in arid environments.}

abstract = {Aims
Proton beam therapy (PBT) has increasingly been applied for the treatment of young children when radiotherapy is needed. The treatment requires intensive multimodality care and is logistically demanding. In this analysis, we evaluated our experiences in treating infants with tumours of the central nervous system with PBT.
Materials and methods
Children younger than 2 years of age treated with PBT for central nervous system tumours enrolled in the prospective registry study KiProReg were retrospectively analysed. Information on patient characteristics, treatment, toxicities and outcome were evaluated. Adverse events were classified according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE V4.0) before, during and after PBT.
Results
Between September 2013 and June 2018, 51 infants were eligible. The median age was 19 months (range 11–23 months) at the time of PBT. Tumour entities were ependymoma (51.0%), atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumour (39.0%), high-grade glioma (6.0%), pineoblastoma (2.0%) and medulloblastoma (2.0%). The prescribed median total dose was 54.0 Gy (range 45.0–59.4 Gy). Most received local radiotherapy. In four patients, craniospinal irradiation followed by a boost to the local tumour bed was applied. The median follow-up time was 42.0 months (range 7.3–86.2 months). The estimated 3-year local control, progression-free survival and overall survival rates for all patients were 62.7, 47.1 and 76.5%, respectively. During radiotherapy, 24 events of higher-grade (CTCAE ≥ °III) toxicities were reported. Interruption of radiotherapy for more than 2 days was due to infection (n = 3) or shunt complication (n = 2). Unexpected hospitalisation during radiotherapy affected 12 patients. Late adverse events attributable to radiotherapy included endocrinopathy (CTCAE °II; 7.8%), new onset of hearing loss (CTCAE °III; 5.8%) and visual impairment (CTCAE °IV; 1.9%). Transient radiation-induced imaging changes occurred in five patients (9.8%).
Conclusions
Our study indicates that PBT is feasible for very young children with central nervous system tumours, at least in the short term. However, it requires challenging interdisciplinary medical care and high logistical effort. For evaluation of late effects, longer follow-up and evaluation of neurocognitive outcome are desirable. More data have to be gathered to further define the role of radiotherapy in infants over time.}

Resident journal clubs are essential to develop skills to critically appraise existing literature. However, most reports of journal clubs focus on logistics of the activity and less on established roles of those involved. Our objective is to report on an innovative journal club from the perspective of key participants.
Materials and Methods
Journal club schedule, assignments, evaluations, and analysis are proffered from our institution. The journal club goals were formulated as: (1) improving resident understanding of research (biostatistical and epidemiologic) methods and statistical concepts, (2) teaching critical appraisal skills, and (3) promoting the use of evidence-based medicine. Each session's format is interactive, consisting of a 10 minute lecture with radiology examples of a research or statistical concept, followed by a journal club style discussion. Crucial to the success of this curriculum has been input and engagement of multiple parties: radiology residents, epidemiologist directors, and subspecialist clinician educator faculty members.
Conclusion
A well-thought out and well-run resident journal club offers numerous solutions to radiology residencies. To residency program leadership and to each individual resident annually, resident journal club offers cutting edge medical knowledge, interactive conferences in the formal didactic curriculum, resident training in critical thinking skills and research design, resident training in interpersonal and communication skills, opportunity for residents to be teachers, and expanded resident interprofessional education. It meets Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education common program, Residency Review Committee diagnostic radiology program, and American Board of Radiology Milestones requirements.}

The market demand for the retailer is assumed to be influenced by the retail price, the product's freshness and other random variables. Both quantity and quality losses are viewed as endogenous variables of the freshness-keeping effort, which is decided by the TPLSP. Dynamic game models for both the decentralized decision mode and the centralized decision mode are developed, and asymmetric demand information is considered in the decentralized decision mode. The analysis shows that decentralized decision making could result in the distortion of the order quantity and selling price and could ultimately result in a loss of supply chain profit. The TPLSP is motivated to exaggerate the demand, which could seriously damage the supplier's interests. Based on an analysis of the major influencing factors in the supply chain system, a coordination contract based on cost and revenue sharing (RS) is designed for the two transaction processes in the three-echelon supply chain system. We illustrate the proposed models with a numerical study and conduct a sensitivity analysis of some of the key parameters in the models. It is proven that with the designed contract, the sales volume can be significantly expanded, all the supply chain members can benefit from Pareto improvement, and both the retailer and the TPLSP have no incentive to exaggerate the market demand.}

Natural gas in its liquid form (Liquified Natural Gas), grows seven times faster than pipeline gas. It is, usually, transferred using liquified natural gas carriers stored in cryogenic tanks. A crucial problem in this field is the selection and the evaluation of liquified natural gas export terminals in different countries (liquified natural gas suppliers). The paper attempts to propose a decision support model specialized for this type of problem, adopting green logistics optimization tools as prescribed in circular economy philosophy. A multicriteria analysis, using Promethee II method, is carried out, evaluating all the potential export terminals and studying the case study of Greece. The approach is based on selected criteria in the fields of economic supply, low environmental impact of transportation, satisfaction of technical specifications and the current and future availability of supply. The evaluation procedure includes the ranking of different preference scenarios. The obtained results showed that there are advantageous liquified natural gas supply options for Greece, like Egypt, Algeria, Libya and Norway, with good performances in almost all the criteria. By adopting the proposed methodology, national and commercial decision makers could take advantage to assess future consortiums.}

The primary aim of this method is to enhance the current industrial state-of-the-art multi-vehicle transportation systems, which, despite their long presence on the factory floor and significant advances over the last decades, still rely on a centralized controller and predetermined network of paths. In order to eliminate the major drawbacks of such systems, including poor scalability, low flexibility, and the presence of a single point of failure, in the proposed control approach vehicles autonomously execute their assigned pick-up and delivery operations by running a fully decentralized control algorithm. The algorithm integrates path planning and motion coordination capabilities and relies on a two-layer control architecture with topological workspace representation on the top layer and state-lattice representation on the bottom layer. Each vehicle plans its own shortest feasible path toward the assigned goal location and resolves conflict situations with other vehicles as they arise along the way. The motion coordination strategy relies on the private-zone mechanism ensuring reliable collision avoidance, and local negotiations within the limited communication radius ensuring high scalability as the number of vehicles in the fleet increases. We present experimental validation results obtained on a system comprising six Pioneer 3DX robots in four different scenarios and simulation results with up to fifty vehicles. We also analyze the overall quality of the proposed traffic management method and compare its performance to other state-of-the-art multi-vehicle coordination approaches.}

abstract = {Summary
Background
In conflict settings, data to guide humanitarian and development responses are often scarce. Although geospatial analyses have been used to estimate health-care access in many countries, such techniques have not been widely applied to inform real-time operations in protracted health emergencies. Doing so could provide a more robust approach for identifying and prioritising populations in need, targeting assistance, and assessing impact. We aimed to use geospatial analyses to overcome such data gaps in Yemen, the site of one of the world's worst ongoing humanitarian crises.
Methods
We derived geospatial coordinates, functionality, and service availability data for Yemen health facilities from the Health Resources and Services Availability Monitoring System assessment done by WHO and the Yemen Ministry of Public Health and Population. We modelled population spatial distribution using high-resolution satellite imagery, UN population estimates, and census data. A road network grid was built from OpenStreetMap and satellite data and modified using UN Yemen Logistics Cluster data and other datasets to account for lines of conflict and road accessibility. Using this information, we created a geospatial network model to deduce the travel time of Yemeni people to their nearest health-care facilities.
Findings
In 2018, we estimated that nearly 8·8 million (30·6%) of the total estimated Yemeni population of 28·7 million people lived more than 30-min travel time from the nearest fully or partially functional public primary health-care facility, and more than 12·1 million (42·4%) Yemeni people lived more than 1 h from the nearest fully or partially functional public hospital, assuming access to motorised transport. We found that access varied widely by district and type of health service, with almost 40% of the population living more than 2 h from comprehensive emergency obstetric and surgical care. We identified and ranked districts according to the number of people living beyond acceptable travel times to facilities and services. We found substantial variability in access and that many front-line districts were among those with the poorest access.
Interpretation
These findings provide the most comprehensive estimates of geographical access to health care in Yemen since the outbreak of the current conflict, and they provide proof of concept for how geospatial techniques can be used to address data gaps and rigorously inform health programming. Such information is of crucial importance for humanitarian and development organisations seeking to improve effectiveness and accountability.

Thus, customer demands are often less predictable, and handling increasing inventory stocks as well as avoiding shortfalls have become particularly important. All these complexity drivers result in higher supply chain risks. Postponement strategies have been proposed as a suitable approach to address these problems. Although the concept of postponement and its impact on the supply chain are theoretically well discussed, optimally configuring the entire production and distribution activities is still challenging. We present a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer linear programming model, which comprises an integrated production and distribution planning approach, and considers postponement concepts. In comparison to earlier approaches that examine postponement strategies, our model supports the decision maker under demand uncertainty and considers lead times, penalty costs for shortfalls, as well as inventory-keeping decisions over a tactical planning horizon. This allows an integrated investigation of both form and logistics postponement concepts. Moreover, we consider the decision maker’s risk attitude identifying non-dominated profitable and risk-averse strategies. We illustrate the benefits of the model by using a case study from the apparel industry, and present the results of a sensitivity analysis with respect to varying demand uncertainty and demand correlations as well as different preferences regarding risk aversion. Furthermore, we carry out performance and quality benchmarks and compare the results of a standard mixed-integer linear programming solver, a parallel nested Benders approach and a sample average approximation technique.}

Evaluate Role of ADC values in assessing response to chemoradiotherapy in cervix cancer & contribution of contrast MRI to identify residual disease, post-treatment completion.
Methods
Prospective observational study in 100 patients of histopathologically proven cancer of the uterine cervix. Based on clinical outcome integrating final histopathological diagnosis patients were classified as either complete response or Residual disease. Validity & reliability of PET-CT, Contrast MRI, and ADC values were checked by calculating sensitivity, specificity, PPV & NPV.
Results
Residual lesions have significantly lower ADC value than that of post-treatment changes. Mean ADC values of residual tumors: 1.26±0.238 x 10-3 mm2/s and mean ADC values of lesions due to post-treatment changes: 1.540 ±0.218 x 10-3 mm2/s (statistically significant difference in between malignant and post-treatment lesions p < 0.05). ADC sensitivity 67%, specificity 83%, PPV 35%, NPV 95 % and accuracy 81% in differentiating residual disease from post-treatment changes. PPV, NPV, sensitivity, and specificity with PET-CT was 93%, 89%, 98%, and 73%. PPV, NPV, sensitivity, and specificity of contrast MRI was 16%, 91%, 58%, and 59%.
Conclusions
Diffusion imaging differentiates residual cervix malignancies from post-treatment changes based on ADC values and can be a promising and evocative biomarker. Complimentary use of ADC and PET/CT may increase diagnostic confidence. However, the cost and logistics of MRI imaging is an important factor in routine clinical implementation especially in developing countries like India, where carcinoma cervix is associated with poor socioeconomic status.

Our objective was to determine whether 15 min yogic breathing exercises practiced 5 times a week can lower blood pressure in uncontrolled hypertensive patients.
Design
Take a deep Breath study was a 3-arm randomized controlled blood pressure trial, 2016–2017 with in-class instruction, home DVD/YouTube instruction, and a control arm. Blood pressure measurements with a 1-month follow-up.
Methods
A list of uncontrolled hypertensive patients (n = 5507) generated from Family Medicine Department’s Electronic Medical Record registry was given to their respective providers to recommend. After chart review of the 1682 recommended patients, the number reduced to 984 of which 610 were contacted and 22% of 610 (n = 133) were enrolled. Eligible participants were randomly assigned to in-class instruction (n = 44), DVD/YouTube group (n = 57), or control (n = 32). The outcome measured was at least 5 mm Hg systolic blood pressure reduction.
Results
Participants were predominately white (89%), approximately half male (52%) with a mean age of 61 years (sd = 12 years). Of the 133 participants who were allocated to a study arm, 30 never participated in any aspect of the study, 20 partially completed and 83 completed the study. Compared to those who completed the study, no differences were noted in demographics or initial blood pressure for those who partially completed. From chart review 6% of participants made a change to their blood pressure medications during the study. Intervention participants were significantly more likely to have ≥5 mm Hg decrease in systolic blood pressure (OR = 4.49, 95% CI: 1.18–17.0) compared to controls in the multivariable logistics model. DVD/YouTube instruction did just as well as in-class instruction group.
Conclusions
In this RCT, statistically significant systolic blood pressure reduction was noted in the intervention groups. Yogic breathing exercises may provide an additional non- pharmacologic tool to treat uncontrolled blood pressure.}

As a result, the Waste Framework Directive (WFD) set a recovery target to attain 70% CDW recycling by 2020. CDW management in individual EU Member States (MS) has been widely explored by previous researchers, however little attention has been paid to investigate the association of CDW arising with national economic, social and technological factors across different countries. Hence, this paper set out to examine and compare CDW generation across EU MS in correlation with their respective national construction turnover, gross domestic product and capita. It also assesses policy framework and CDW recovery performance of each MS against the WFD recovery target. Statistical data reported by Eurostat were collected and further analysed. A critical assessment of Eurostat CDW data reliability was carried out. A novel approach was adopted by ranking MS in respect to the amount of CDW generated per ‘construction turnover, GDP and capita’ (CDW-TGC). Results show that Austria, Germany, Netherlands, Belgium and France were found to be the highest CDW-TGC producers, whereas Croatia, Slovenia, Slovakia, Poland, Portugal and Spain were found to be the lowest. Further, most MS rely on ‘waste management plans’ rather than specific national CDW regulations. No correlation was found between landfill taxation and CDW landfilled or recovered. Eleven MS still need to improve their recovery performance to achieve the WFD target. Finally, four key CDW recovery challenges were identified: ineffective CDW regulations, incoherent data quality, undeveloped reverse logistics and a low market readiness for secondary materials.}

This growing need for inclusion of sustainability is driving original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to collaborate with third-party reverse logistics providers (3PRLPs) to sustainably manage returns. Collaboration with 3PRLP will put OEMs in a stronger position regarding compliance with government legislation, improving upon their corporate image and customer satisfaction. It is a win-win situation for the OEM. On the other hand, from the 3PRLP's point of view, it is important to know the capabilities of the OEMs before entering into a collaborative endeavour. Hence, it is firstly necessary to identify the most appropriate attributes of the manufacturer which are essential for a sustainable collaboration. In this context, the study proposes a novel framework for investigating the performance attributes of the OEMs from the economic, environmental and social aspects of sustainability. Since the evaluation of each attribute for each dimension of sustainability differs in terms of the nature of the information needed and the time and resources required, it is necessary to conduct a pre-evaluation of the attributes using the Complex Proportional Assessment (COPRAS) method. Furthermore, the shortlisted attributes for each sustainability dimension are evaluated and prioritized using the best worst method (BWM). The novelty of the attribute selection process lies in simultaneously considering the degree of importance of the attribute as well as the degree of difficulty of the collection of data required for the assessment of the OEM. The result of this study helps decision-makers and practitioners to comprehend the most influential attributes of OEMs which are crucial for collaboration, thus enhancing the overall sustainability impact of the supply chain. The managerial implications drawn from the resulting analysis provide the 3PRLP with a sustainable evaluation framework which can be ideally used for the selection of collaborative partners. The above model is validated using the case of an Indian 3PRLP company that handles electronic products.}

abstract = {To meet the increasing demand for functional food and changing consumer habits, the food processing industry is shifting from flow manufacturing to batch manufacturing. As a consequence, job-shop (JS) systems are progressively developing to replace traditional food-processing systems. Such systems are characterized by high complexity in their design and management due to the high number of entities involved (i.e., products, components and parts, resources or workshops, operators, handling tools), the technological and operational constraints (i.e., working cycle, shop throughput, set-up tasks), and the layout issues (i.e., flow lines, congestions, bottlenecks). This chapter explores the impact of logistics and handling tasks in the design of food JS processing facilities. The aims of the JS designer are the minimization of the infrastructural costs, the optimization of the products and labor flows, and the enhancement of the safety of food products, affecting concurrently the layouts, operations, and related performances. The chapter illustrates a set of methodologies and quantitative indicators that aid the design of a JS system involving logistic efficiency, infrastructure cost minimization, and food safety targets. We assess the layout of the manufacturing system through a multidisciplinary dashboard of key performance indicators (KPIs) (1) and a design methodology addressing the resource dimensioning problem (2). A numerical example gathered from an Italian catering company showcases the application of the proposed tools and elicits debate on the best practice for facility design in the food service (catering) industry.}

abstract = {Background
The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends all healthcare personnel receive an annual influenza vaccination. Many challenges exist in achieving this goal, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as, employees working remotely and social distancing rules. In prior years we executed fixed-internal point of distribution (POD) vaccination events. Last year we implemented a highly successful fixed-external Drive-Thru POD. Drive-Thru PODs can be safe and effective approaches to employee vaccination during a pandemic.
Methods
A 90-minute drive-thru Flu POD was accomplished from 7am-8:30am at the main employee Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center entrance. Social distancing, masking was enforced. VA-Police directed traffic at the checkpoint into two lanes; flu shot, and non-flu shot lanes. Employees were directed to drive to one of ten tables each staffed with two nurses; Employees received their vaccination while remaining in their vehicle. Employee safety was of paramount concern; weather conditions, rain date, traffic control, location were all predetermined. Coordinating services included: VA-Police, Emergency Management, VA-Fire Department, Public Affairs, Logistics, Nursing, Pharmacy, Environmental Management, and Information Technology for promoting this event.
Results
On October 7th 385 employees received the flu vaccine compared to 290 in 2019. The event yielded a rate of 427 doses administered per 100 minutes compared to 322 in 2019, and only 15 per 100 minutes during internal flu POD 2018-19. This well-planned event was convenient, safe, and efficient without unintended consequences. The employees appreciated the ease, accommodation, and safety provided during this event.
Conclusions
Our drive-thru POD event during COVID-19 was even more successful than the year's prior. Its improved time/vaccine ratio for employee flu vaccine administration and effective project management resulted in a well-organized, streamlined process and higher employee satisfaction. This innovative strategy can be utilized as an emergency-response vaccination plan especially during a pandemic, and the basis for planning a COVID-19 vaccine distribution model.}

abstract = {Background
For patients requiring admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), transfers of care (TOC) during admission to and discharge from the ICU are particularly high-risk periods for medication errors. In the Australian setting, commonly general wards and the ICU do not share an integrated Electronic Medical ecord (EMR) and specifically an Electronic Medication Management System (EMMS) as part of the EMR.
Purpose
To evaluate the effect of a hospital wide integrated EMMS on medication error rates during ICU admission and at TOC.
Method
A 6-month historical control study was performed before and after implementation of the EMMS in the ICU of a tertiary hospital. Prescribing errors detected by pharmacists in the study period were divided into phase 1, (pre-EMMS, 6months), phase 2 (3 months post implementation after shakedown stage) and phase 3 (next 3 months of post implementation). They were categorized as prescribing error types under system or clinical intervention. Chi square statistics and interrupted time series analysis were used to determine if there was significant change in the proportion of patients who had an error at TOC during each phase. Logistics regression was used to determine the relationship between the dependent (error type) and the independent variable (study phase) for errors that occurred during TOC.
Results
Errors occurred during TOC in 42 %, 64 % and 19 % of patients in phase 1, 2 and 3 respectively. There was a significant decline in the proportion of patients with an error between phase 1 and 3 (p < 0.01). During a patient’s ICU admission, at least one medication error occurred in 28.3 %, 62.6 % and 25.1 % in phase 1, 2 and 3 respectively. Besides procedural errors, the likelihood of an error occurring was greatest in phase 1, compared to phase 2 and 3 across system-related error categories.
Conclusion
Medication errors during TOC reduced following implementation of the integrated ICU EMMS. EMMS safety features facilitated reduced system related prescribing errors as well as the severity of errors made.}

abstract = {Purpose/Objective(s)
At least half of patients who die of cancer suffer from symptoms that adversely affect quality of life, many of which are amenable to palliative radiotherapy (PRT). In this population, urgent assessment and PRT initiation can be beneficial. At our institution, patients requiring PRT can be assessed in multiple settings, including through a dedicated multidisciplinary Palliative Radiation Oncology (PRO) clinic. We examined the logistics of PRT delivery by consultation setting.
Materials/Methods
This secondary analysis of routinely collected data examined adult female patients with breast cancer who died between 04/01/2013 and 03/31/2014, after at least one course of PRT. During this period, setting and timing of PRT consultation was at the attending physicians’ discretion. Patient- and treatment-related data were abstracted including timelines of consultation, simulation (sim), treatment start and PRT completion. Descriptive statistics along with independent t-tests and Chi-square tests were calculated.
Results
65/121 patients had one course of PRT, 33 had two, and 23 had three or more, with on average 1.3 sites treated per course. 27/215 (12.5%) consults took place in the PRO clinic while 166/215 (77.2%) occurred in the on-treatment review clinic. Average interval from referral to consult, consult to sim, and sim to start for PRO visits were 4.7 days, 0 days and 1.8 days respectively; for non-PRO visits, intervals were 4.8 days (P = 0.95), 1.3 days (P = 0.42) and 4.8 days (P = 0.008), respectively. Same day sim occurred in 100% of PRO visits versus 86.2% (162/188) of non PRO visits (P = 0.052). Same day PRT start occurred in 37% of PRO visits versus 23.4% of non-PRO visits (P = 0.13). 44% (11/25) of PRT courses for bone metastases prescribed after PRO visits were single fraction versus 25.6% (46/180) after non-PRO. There were no significant differences in rate of completion of prescribed PRT (100% after PRO vs 98.4% after non-PRO consults) or completion within 14 days of death (3.7% after PRO vs 5.3% after non-PRO).
Conclusion
Consultation utilizing dedicated established PRO clinic infrastructure facilitates efficacious PRT delivery.}

abstract = {Introduction: Axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) and tisagenlecleucel (tisa-cel) are chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapies approved in the United States (US) for the treatment of relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma (R/R LBCL). Almost half of all patients with cancer are treated in community-based oncology practices in the US. Understanding the adoption of novel therapies by community hematologists/oncologists (cH/O) is critical to assessing their future utilization and impact on clinical outcomes. We sought to study the temporal trends of CAR-T utilization over a year among cH/O and their perceptions regarding the barriers to adoption of CAR-T therapies in R/R LBCL in a descriptive study using survey-based methodology. Methods: Live meetings held in February 2019 (cohort A) and Winter 2020 (November 2019-February 2020, cohort B) convened cH/O of diverse US regions and practice types to better understand perceptions around CAR-T, its utilization in R/R LBCL, and referral patterns. Participants were compensated for participation and submitted responses via web-based pre-meeting surveys and live audience response system. All responses are summarized using descriptive statistics. A subset analysis was performed for the cH/O who were surveyed in both cohort A and cohort B. Results: A total of 59 and 168 cH/O participated in this research study in cohorts A and B, respectively: 61% and 70% of participants identified their primary specialty as hematology/oncology; in a private community practice (50% and 56%), or community practice owned by a hospital or academic center (44% and 24%, p=.003). Both groups reported seeing an average of >20 patients per day. The proportion of cH/O who indicated that they had referred at least one patient for CAR-T therapy for R/R LBCL in the preceding 6 months was 54% and 93% (p<.00001) in cohorts A and B, respectively. The median number of patients referred for CAR-T therapy in the preceding 6 months in cohorts A and B was 1 and 2, respectively. Of those who had referred patients, 32% and 29% indicated that none of the patients referred had yet received the product infusion. Among the 30 physicians who participated at both time points, the percentage of those who had referred a patient for CAR-T in the preceding 6 months was 57% and 41% (p=.25), and the rates of non-receipt of product infusion for all referred patients among these 30 cH/O was 29% and 36% (p=.09) for the 2019 and 2020 timepoints, respectively. The major barriers to utilization of CAR-T therapy identified in cohorts A and B, respectively, included: the cost of the therapy (46% and 64%, p=.01), high toxicity (24% and 38%, p=.07) and lack of long-term survival data (19% and 24%, p=.66). The logistics of CAR-T process were identified by over half (52%) of cH/O as a barrier to utilization in cohort A. This issue of logistics was explored further in cohort B with barriers to intake of patients being attributable to either the payer or the CAR-T center. The payer-specific challenges included slow approval process by payers (27%) and high rates of denials by payers (15%). The challenges specific to the CAR-T center included a slow intake process (23%) and a lack of a CAR-T center in geographic vicinity (13%). Other challenges reported by the participants included deterioration of the patient prior to CAR-T administration (64%) and the lack of communication from the CAR-T center during the process, including lack of instructions to the primary oncologist (14%) and the patient (6%). Conclusions: Overall, the probability of referral for CAR-T therapies in R/R LBCL among cH/O increased over the study period. The proportion of patients unable to receive CAR-T product has remained relatively constant at almost one-third of patients referred. Among physicians who were polled at two timepoints, there does not seem to be increased adoption of CAR-T therapy, though this may arise from the relative rarity of the appropriate patients. High cost and toxicity continue to be potential deterrents to CAR-T consideration and appear to be increasing in significance. These findings can assist manufacturers, payers, and CAR-T centers to focus on modifiable process improvements in patient referral, payer-authorization, and improved intake to facilitate timely access to a potentially curative therapy for patients with R/R LBCL.

abstract = {Objective
To explore the value of single source dual-energy spectral CT quantitative parameters in differential diagnosis of liver abscess and liver metastatic tumor.
Methods
Fifty-one patients with 73 liver lesions (28 liver abscesses and 45 liver metastases) underwent plain and contrast-enhanced spectral CT scans. The fat and blood concentrations and CT values of 40–140 keV monochromatic images were measured to calculate effective atomic number (Eff-Z) and a slope (K): [CT(40 keV)-CT(140 keV)/100] for the cystic component on the plain scan images. The iodine concentration of the lesion wall on the enhanced three-phase images were measured and normalized to that of aorta for normalized iodine concentration (NIC). All of the single quantitative parameters were compared between liver abscesses and liver metastases by the independent samples t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. Statistical difference parameters between liver abscesses and liver metastases were analyzed by receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The diagnostic capability was determined by calculating the area under the curve (AUC). Using binary logistics regression analysis combining the best diagnostic performance parameter in the plain and enhanced phase images. The predictive model of liver abscess was established, and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed.
Results
There were significant differences in CT value, the slope (K), Eff-Z, blood and fat concentrations in the plain phase and NIC in the contrast-enhanced venous and delay phases between liver abscesses and liver metastases (all P < 0.05). The CT value at 40 keV in the plain phase provided 0.761 in area under the curve (AUC) in ROC with sensitivity of 71.4% and, specificity of 75.6% in differentiating liver abscess and tumor. Combining with NIC in delay phase, the respectively values improved to 0.963, and 89.3% and 93.3%.
Conclusion
The quantitative parameters in single source dual-energy CT provide high diagnostic accuracy in differentiating liver abscesses from liver metastases.}

Our modern day and age has been termed as the “Plastic Age” for a very simple reason, plastics have replaced all classical materials in almost all applications. This led to a reliance on them which resulted in the accumulation of large amounts of waste that now has to be dealt with in a sustainable and economical manner. In order to do this, the ultimate treatment for such waste was deemed to be converting it to highly beneficial products. These products can include chemicals, fuel, and energy. The first chapter starts off the book with a fundamental review and technical description of the main terms faced along its subsequent chapters. It will also define what is typically classed as polymers and plastics so that readers will be able to understand the plastic solid waste (PSW) management hierarchy to study the preference order for managing this type of waste. Hence, the main production and supply chain of plastic materials will be described all the way to its “grave,” which in this case is waste disposal. This chapter will also cover the associated factors with PSW management for product recovery, covering socio-economic factors and logistics, which are associated with such work. PSW sustainability within the production cycle will also be examined. It is very important to understand the origin of plastic materials and how we can deal with them in a sustainable manner. This is in order to be able to develop an integrated cycle for PSW management that can sustain itself from feedstock preparation stages to product recovery in an environmentally friendly manner that can compete with conventional technologies available on the market.}

abstract = {Background and aims
The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in associated lockdown restrictions for individuals across England, including the postponement of all recreational sporting provisions. The beneficial effects of regular physical activity are well established yet to the authors' knowledge, no research addresses the cancellation of all recreational provisions. Using quantitative and qualitative methods, this study assessed the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on recreational sports players, what alternative exercise methods have been sought and how players feel about returning to their sport.
Method
An online survey was distributed across England for six-weeks commencing in May 2020. A questionnaire explored differences in the impact of COVID-19 restrictions between sex, winter/summer/year-round sports, team/individual sports, age, and resilience groups. The use of alternative exercise methods, coping strategies and feelings about returning to sport were also investigated. Responses were gathered from 2023 adults whose recreational sport had been cancelled by COVID-19. All completed questionnaires (n = 1213) were taken for analysis (mean age = 49.41 years, SD = 17.165, 55.2% female).
Results
Quantitative findings showed the negative impact of COVID-19 restrictions was greater for females, those involved in winter and team sports, those aged 18–39 and low-resilient copers (p < .05). No significant differences were found between individuals that had had COVID-19 or were considered vulnerable by government guidelines. Acceptance was the most common coping strategy. The average number of days per week that participants exercised significantly increased during lockdown, with significant increases also seen in the use of online workouts, fitness apps and home-gym exercise. Qualitative findings suggested that participants are looking forward to the social and physical benefits of recreational activity restarting yet are concerned about the logistics of returning under social distancing restrictions. Other worries included loss of fitness, spreading (younger age groups) and catching (older age groups) COVID-19 and being in a crowd.
Conclusions
Results highlight what is currently accessible to home-based exercisers and inform the reintroduction of recreational sports clubs. As COVID-19 restrictions look to persist, club representatives should provide accessible home-exercise options and be cautious of participant concerns when considering the return of recreational sport.}

abstract = {Background
Supporting young people's mental and physical health is a global policy priority, but detecting need and facilitating access to health services and support is challenging. We aimed to explore the perspectives of young people and professional stakeholders of the acceptability, utility, and effectiveness of a school-based online health and wellbeing screening tool, the Digital Health Contact (DHC), which has linked follow-up support. The DHC was initially piloted in 2017, and has been running ever since.
Methods
Delivered by Public Health School Nurses (PHSN) in the East Midlands, the DHC aims to identify and put in place strategies to meet the unmet health needs among young people. As part of a wider evaluation of the DHC intervention, we carried out semistructured online interviews. Data were analysed thematically. The data management software NVivo 12 was used to facilitate coding. Ethical approval for the study was granted by the University of Sheffield. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.
Findings
Between Aug 2, 2020, and June 8, 2021, we carried out online interviews with 14 key stakeholders involved in the design and implementation of the DHC (two commissioners, one provider, six PHSN, two health-care staff, and three school leaders; 13 female, one male) and 29 young people (aged 13–14 years old; 21 female, eight male) from one school who had participated in the DHC. Young people perceived the DHC as an acceptable and useful way of discussing health needs. The delivery method and context of the DHC (online, at home, and at school), and knowledge of the involvement of the PHSN in delivering the DHC, was noted by the young people to facilitate honest responses and greater amounts of engagement. Stakeholders perceived the universal application of the DHC with linked follow-up intervention as an effective means of identifying and supporting young people with unmet needs, and an efficient way to target limited service resources. There were barriers around enabling school engagement typically in terms of logistics, school infrastructure, and perspectives of fit with schools. These barriers were seen to be negated through developing effective working relationships between PHSN and schools.
Interpretation
The DHC was consistently perceived as an effective and acceptable tool for detecting need and providing support from those delivering and receiving it. The DHC's universal screening and linked follow-up support approach has great potential and could be adopted more widely to help identify and support unmet health need among young people.

In this study, ‘McIntosh’ and ‘Empire’ fruit were treated with AVG at four weeks or two weeks, or with 1-MCP one week, prior to the anticipated first harvest date, to assess effects of these chemicals on maturation and ripening in relation to starch degradation. In a second season, ‘Empire’ fruit were treated with either AVG or 1-MCP four weeks and one week prior to the anticipated first harvest. Fruit from this experiment were also harvested to investigate the effects of treatment on ripening in air storage. Cultivar and timing of application influenced the efficacy of both AVG and 1-MCP in delaying the increase of internal ethylene concentration (IEC) and the starch pattern index (SPI), and the decrease of starch concentration, in the fruit. Little effect of treatment was found for the high ethylene producing ‘McIntosh’, with only the SPI being affected on the date of first harvest. ‘Empire’ fruit from trees treated with 1-MCP or AVG had lower IEC and were greener (higher absorbance difference index (IAD) values), and had lower SPIs and higher starch concentrations, but the effects were inconsistent and limited to only some harvest dates. In storage, only 1-MCP applied 10 d before harvest markedly slowed the increase in IEC and the rate of softening. AVG treatment effects on IEC were intermediate, between the one week 1-MCP treatment and the untreated controls and 4 week 1-MCP treatment, while it did not affect softening. Treatments did not affect the rate of starch concentration loss during storage.}

The East Timor Hearts Fund (ETHF) is a charitable organisation of Australian cardiologists providing outreach screening in Timor-Leste. For patients requiring intervention, ETHF arranges logistics, procedures, and postoperative care. The aim of this project is to evaluate outcomes of patients requiring intervention.
Methods
The ETHF database of all patients was utilised to identify patients with disease warranting surgical or percutaneous intervention. Both patients who underwent intervention and those who did not proceed to intervention were included in this study. Patients who had intervention arranged by other organisations but have then had follow-up with ETHF were also included. Overall demographics and pre and postoperative factors were assessed, with sub-group analysis of adult and paediatric patients to identify any differences in care.
Results
Of 221 patients requiring intervention, 101 patients underwent intervention, receiving 22 different operations or procedures. Patients were predominantly young (median age 17.5 years) and female (64.7%), with rheumatic heart disease (63.8%). Twenty-four (24) (33.3%) women aged 15–45 years old with cardiac disease warranting intervention were documented as pregnant or breastfeeding at time of clinic assessment. Of patients who did not proceed to intervention, adults were more likely to be lost to follow-up (42.4% vs 18.5%) while paediatric patients were more likely to experience progression of disease (18.5% vs 7.5%, p=0.005). Median waitlist time was 5 months, with no significant difference between adults and children, correlating with a preoperative mortality rate of 5.4%. For patients who underwent intervention, post-procedure mortality was extremely low (0.9%) and attendance of at least one post-procedure review was excellent (99.0%). Eleven (11) (10.9%) patients have required repeat intervention, with no difference in rates between adult and paediatric patients. Length of follow-up extends up to 20 years for some patients.
Conclusion
The Timor-Leste interventional cohort was predominantly a young female population with rheumatic and congenital cardiac disease. There were also high rates of pregnancy amongst female patients with severe cardiac disease. Delayed access to intervention may result in preoperative adverse events and mortality, and is a key target for improvement. Patients who undergo intervention have very low post-procedural mortality, good adherence to early medical follow-up and good long-term outcomes.}

abstract = {INTRODUCTION Appropriate restriction of blood transfusion is important to reduce harm to patients and cost to society. Current research shows that every RBC transfused unit increases 30-day mortality (odd ratio = 1.32), composite morbidity (odd ratio =1.23), pneumonia (odd ratio = 1.24) and sepsis/shock (odd ratio = 1.29) of 95% Confidence Interval. Literature shows that it is feasible to significantly reduce healthcare costs and potential transfusion-related harm by minimizing blood transfusion orders. This will help improve transfusion quality, minimize administrative cost, and maximize patient safety. We examined the extent of adherence to the American Association of Blood Banks (AABB) transfusion guidelines by reviewing blood transfusions orders that were fulfilled throughout the year of 2018, and the potential effect of quality improvement intervention. OBJECTIVES The objective of this research is to restrict blood transfusion products through the implementation of an automated process that accords with current guidelines. The process entails modifying the current interface at the VA Palm Beach and effectively create an embedded clinical decision-making system that includes appropriate logistics to guide the appropriateness of blood transfusion orders. The interface promises interactive pop-up dialogue that engages users with a set of rules to assess transfusion indication and guide its appropriateness. The proposed intervention provides safer evidence-based transfusion, reduced risk of non-infectious adverse events and infectious agents, and decreased demand on limited blood supplies. METHODS This is a retrospective analysis of transfused patients in year 2018 .The data was retrieved from an electronic medical record database, which included patient gender, age, comorbidities, mean baseline hemoglobin, pre- and post- transfusion hemoglobin, hemodynamics status, complications, active bleeding, history of cardiac disease, ordering division, and number of units transfused. Patients were randomly selected from January to August 2018 (n=204). Roughly 302 PRBC units were transfused, averaging 1.4 units per person. Insignificant life-threatening complications were reported. The Average pre-transfusion hemoglobin was 7.6, and post-transfusion hemoglobin was 9.3. 54% received 2 units, whereas 46% received 1 unit. INTERVENTIONS We propose a two-tier auditing system, based on a low and high priority, which reflects the timeline to address non-compliant transfusion orders. Low priority orders are evaluated during the periodic meeting of the transfusion committee, and high priority orders are addressed within a few hours of the transfusion order. All transfusion orders of Hg > 7-8 g/dL are flagged with low priority, whereas those with Hg> 8g/dl and/or with orders exceeding one unit are flagged with high priority. The intervention includes: Identify the key Stakeholders and seek appropriate approvals, modify the existing interface to comply with AABB transfusion guidelines, establish a cultural change of blood management, “Every One (unit) Matters”, educate our staff, physicians, residents, and students, through didactic channels on guidelines, and present case reports on patient safety. RESULTS The system was embedded with a logging mechanism to record non-compliant order requests, collect pre and post intervention data, audit transfusion records, restrict transfusions to 1 unit per order. Each unit is treated as a unique clinical decision, and each patient is evaluated for symptoms upon every transfusion. The interface also includes a logistics serving as a clinical decision tool and as an advisory delineating transfusion indication. Each transfusion order placed that doesn't meet requirements is reviewed retrospectively and is considered a fall out and flagged for chart review. Cases are escalated to the medical review committee, based on auditing priority, and the ordering physician is contacted accordingly. CONCLUSION Each unit blood transfused is associated with incrementally increased risk for adverse outcomes. Improvement of the overall transfusion rate is a key component to the success of this project. Our future directions are to engage and earn the confidence of all divisions, as well as change the existing culture in order to promote evidence-based medicine and safer practices in a cost-effective manner.

abstract = {Purpose
During lung transplantation, donor biopsies are collected for histologic and biomarker assessments to understand lung injury. Samples are often taken from a single location and it is unknown whether this is truly representative of the injury across the organ. The objective of this study was to investigate the uniformity of cytokine mRNA expression in tissue samples collected from different locations in donor lungs.
Methods
Eight unused donor lungs were inflated, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and partitioned into 10 to 15 slices from apex to base. Five 1 cm3 biopsies were taken from each lung; three were consistently taken from the third, sixth, and ninth slices, while two were taken from the lingula and a noted potential injury site. Three pieces of each biopsy were used to measure mRNA expression of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and IL-1β as markers of lung inflammation by PCR in a total of n=120 samples from the eight lungs. Intra-biopsy and intra-lung variations were analyzed with equal-variance tests, coefficients of variance, one-way ANOVA, and pairwise mean comparisons.
Results
Across all donors, the intra-biopsy equal-variance F-values ranged from 0.19-0.95 with means of 0.33, 0.57, 0.62, and 0.58 for IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10. The mean biopsy coefficient of variance was 25.9% across all donors. The mean comparisons of biopsies in each donor showed that the three consistent slices were identical in donors rejected for logistics and thrombotic emboli. Both the lingula and focal injury biopsies demonstrated larger differences in cytokine expression from the rest of the donor lung.
Conclusion
While intra-biopsy variances were present, they were small and consistent across multiple biopsies in donors, indicating the reliability of repeated analysis of banked specimens. Lungs rejected for non-graft related reasons demonstrated more consistent gene expression. The lingula is not a representative site as it often differed from other biopsies in all donors. We conclude that a donor lung biopsy taken from an area other than the lingula reflects the overall condition of the lung, unless there is obvious localized injury (e.g. infection) which has a unique profile. These findings will reassure the scientific community that a biopsy of the donor lung is indeed representative of the whole lung, and will help to guide diagnostic and therapeutic interventions in donor lungs for transplantation.}

abstract = {Aim
Individual vulnerability to shift work disorder (SWD) varies. The aim of the present study was to verify the individual characteristics that predicted SWD onset by following Chinese intern nurses who at baseline had not worked rotating or night shifts.
Methods
A total of 706 Chinese first-year intern female nurses aged 16–24 years were recruited. At baseline (T0), they reported demographic characteristics, insomnia symptoms and excessive sleepiness, trait neuroticism, sleep reactivity, morningness, and circadian flexibility and languidity. At the three-month (T1) and six-month (T2) follow-up, the SWD status was determined based on significant sleep disturbance and/or excessive sleepiness in the context of working a rotating shift schedule.
Results and conclusions
The prevalence rates of SWD were 35.2% at T1 and 37.7% at T2. Two bivariate logistics regressions revealed that morningness (odds ratio [OR] = 1.31, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.09–1.58, T1; OR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.12–1.65, T2), languidity (OR = 1.56, 95% CI = 1.28–1.90, T1), and sleep reactivity (OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.07–1.57, T1; OR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.07–1.61, T2) predicted the onset of SWD, while flexibility (OR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.62–0.90, T1) decreased the odds of SWD onset. By comparing nurses with SWD and nurses without SWD across all six months, morningness (OR = 1.58, 95% CI = 1.20–2.07), sleep reactivity (OR = 1.54, 95% CI = 1.16–2.04), languidity (OR = 1.70, 95% CI = 1.30–2.22), and flexibility (OR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.54–0.90) showed significant effects on persistent SWD.}

abstract = {Objectives
Advance care planning (ACP) is seldom initiated with people with dementia (PWD) and mainly focuses on medical end-of-life decisions. We studied the effects of an educational intervention for general practitioners (GPs) aimed at initiating and optimizing ACP, with a focus on discussing medical and nonmedical preferences of future care.
Design
A single-blinded cluster randomized controlled trial.
Setting and participants
In 2016, 38 Dutch GPs (all from different practices) completed the study. They recruited 140 PWD, aged ≥65 years at any stage and with any type of dementia, from their practice.
Methods
Intervention group GPs were trained in ACP, including shared decision-making and role-playing exercises. Control group GPs provided usual care. The primary outcome was ACP initiation: the proportion of PWD that had at least 1 ACP conversation documented in their medical file. Key secondary outcomes were the number of medical (ie, resuscitation, hospital admission) and nonmedical (ie, activities, social contacts) preferences discussed. At the 6-month follow-up, subjects' medical records were analyzed using random effect logistics and linear models with correction for GP clustering.
Results
38 GP clusters (19 intervention; 19 control) included 140 PWD (intervention 73; control 67). Four PWD (2.9%) dropped out on the primary and key secondary outcomes. After 6 months, intervention group GPs initiated ACP with 35 PWD (49.3%), and control group GPs initiated ACP with 9 PWD (13.9%) [odds ratio (OR) 1.99; P = .002]. Intervention group GPs discussed 0.8 more medical [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.3, 1.3; P = .003] and 1.5 more nonmedical (95% CI 0.8, 2.3; P < .001) preferences per person with dementia than control group GPs.
Conclusions and Implications
Our educational intervention increased ACP initiation, and the number of nonmedical and medical preferences discussed. This intervention has the potential to better align future care of PWD with their preferences but because of the short follow-up, the GPs' long-term adoption remains unknown.}

abstract = {The quality of hot mixed asphalt (HMA) is heavily dependent on the quality of the compaction. However, this operation is very complex, where a large number of parameters (e.g., logistics, weather condition, the skill level of operators, paver speed, etc.) play a role in the operation. To ensure high-quality compaction, operators and site managers need to process a large volume of data in real-time. The high dependency of compaction quality on the largely tacit knowledge of the operators introduces a considerable variability to the quality of compaction operations. In recent years, several compaction support systems are developed to provide operators and site managers with real-time temperature and compaction information. However, these support systems mostly provide the support data in a descriptive manner, i.e., just indicating the current status of the asphalt layer in terms of temperature and compaction maps. In this sense, the operators and managers still need to analyze and interpret the provided data and develop compaction strategies. As a result, it is argued that these systems not only do not reduce the dependency on the tacit knowledge but also can increase the cognitive load on the decision-makers and thus affect the compaction adversely. This research argues that for any compaction support systems to be more effective, it is necessary to provide more prescriptive feedback, i.e., translate the sensory data into actionable guidance that requires less interpretation from the operators and decision-makers. Therefore, the main objective of this research is to develop a framework for compaction guidance systems that can translate the temperature and compaction count (i.e., descriptive) data into clear suggestions for compaction strategies (i.e., prescriptive). A novel priority mapping method is developed to translate the data of (1) the temperature and compaction status of the asphalt mat, and (2) the location of compactors into an index representing the compaction priorities of different parts of the asphalt at any given time. Also, a novel effective compaction rate (ECR) index is proposed in this research to enable an objective and quantitative assessment of compaction operation quality. A prototype is developed and implemented in a case study to investigate the feasibility of the proposed framework. The effectiveness of the proposed guidance system is then assessed through a case study where the proposed method was tested in terms of the extent to which it improves the efficiency of the compaction. It is shown that the transition from the descriptive compaction support system to a more prescriptive guidance system can improve the efficiency of compaction up to 115%. Nevertheless, it is discovered that such a transition may not resonate well with the operators who tend to perceive a loss of control over the compaction strategy as a drawback of the guidance systems. This suggests that the technological transition to compaction guidance systems should coincide with a change of operators' mindset towards new ways of interaction with the collected sensory data}

abstract = {Summary
Background
The rapid spread of COVID-19 renewed the focus on how health systems across the globe are financed, especially during public health emergencies. Development assistance is an important source of health financing in many low-income countries, yet little is known about how much of this funding was disbursed for COVID-19. We aimed to put development assistance for health for COVID-19 in the context of broader trends in global health financing, and to estimate total health spending from 1995 to 2050 and development assistance for COVID-19 in 2020.
Methods
We estimated domestic health spending and development assistance for health to generate total health-sector spending estimates for 204 countries and territories. We leveraged data from the WHO Global Health Expenditure Database to produce estimates of domestic health spending. To generate estimates for development assistance for health, we relied on project-level disbursement data from the major international development agencies' online databases and annual financial statements and reports for information on income sources. To adjust our estimates for 2020 to include disbursements related to COVID-19, we extracted project data on commitments and disbursements from a broader set of databases (because not all of the data sources used to estimate the historical series extend to 2020), including the UN Office of Humanitarian Assistance Financial Tracking Service and the International Aid Transparency Initiative. We reported all the historic and future spending estimates in inflation-adjusted 2020 US$, 2020 US$ per capita, purchasing-power parity-adjusted US$ per capita, and as a proportion of gross domestic product. We used various models to generate future health spending to 2050.
Findings
In 2019, health spending globally reached $8·8 trillion (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 8·7–8·8) or $1132 (1119–1143) per person. Spending on health varied within and across income groups and geographical regions. Of this total, $40·4 billion (0·5%, 95% UI 0·5–0·5) was development assistance for health provided to low-income and middle-income countries, which made up 24·6% (UI 24·0–25·1) of total spending in low-income countries. We estimate that $54·8 billion in development assistance for health was disbursed in 2020. Of this, $13·7 billion was targeted toward the COVID-19 health response. $12·3 billion was newly committed and $1·4 billion was repurposed from existing health projects. $3·1 billion (22·4%) of the funds focused on country-level coordination and $2·4 billion (17·9%) was for supply chain and logistics. Only $714·4 million (7·7%) of COVID-19 development assistance for health went to Latin America, despite this region reporting 34·3% of total recorded COVID-19 deaths in low-income or middle-income countries in 2020. Spending on health is expected to rise to $1519 (1448–1591) per person in 2050, although spending across countries is expected to remain varied.
Interpretation
Global health spending is expected to continue to grow, but remain unequally distributed between countries. We estimate that development organisations substantially increased the amount of development assistance for health provided in 2020. Continued efforts are needed to raise sufficient resources to mitigate the pandemic for the most vulnerable, and to help curtail the pandemic for all.

abstract = {The harsh conditions in Victoria Land, Antarctica have formed a simple ecosystem dominated by microbes that use rocks as shelters to avoid environmental stressors. The area is composed of basement rocks that illustrate the history of complex deformation, thus it is highly valuable not only in perspectives of geology but also in biological aspects. Because this region is inhospitable to higher-level organisms and receives least external influences, it can be an ideal environment to investigate the relationship between rock-inhabiting bacterial communities and environmental factors. In such conditions, inorganics dissolved from minerals can be considered as key factors influencing rock-inhabiting bacterial communities. Thus, the present study attempted to explore rock-inhabiting bacterial communities throughout Victoria Land, to identify environmental parameters that are more influential on bacterial community compositions, and to investigate latitudinal gradients in environmental parameters and rock-inhabiting bacterial communities. The results suggested that (i) rock-inhabiting bacterial communities in Victoria Land predominately consisted of either Actinobacteria or Proteobacteria; (ii) latitudinal gradients in rock-inhabiting bacterial community compositions and some environmental parameters were observed; (iii) latitude, pH, nitrate, and sulfate significantly correlated with the dominant phyla; and (iv) the Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis demonstrated that latitude, pH, and sulfate concentrations could explain the dominant phylum with 89% accuracy. These findings can provide important insight into the link between environmental factors and rock-inhabiting bacterial community compositions in conditions with extremely cold temperatures and high levels of radiation, which could also be of interest in astrobiology.}

To understand the motivations for recycling, this study identifies and prioritizes the key factors that affect C&D waste recycling behaviour of various stakeholders in Hong Kong (i.e., representatives from construction-waste-related organizations, environmental consultants and contractors, and government engineers) in a quantitative manner using statistical tools. Different from traditional C&D waste behavioural determinants studies, this paper utilizes an integrated analytical method through semi-structured interviews and survey questionnaire on the basis of Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). Qualitative thematic analysis and quantitative frequency analysis were performed to analyse responses from semi-structured interviews and questionnaires, followed by correlation analysis to quantify the relationships between factors. Results indicated that four key factors: (i) regulatory compliance, (ii) economic incentives, (iii) accreditation scheme, and (iv) logistics and management incentives directly influenced recycling behaviour of individuals. Regulatory compliance was the most determining factor for consultants, contractors, experts, and government officials, whereas economic incentives were of great concern to the public. Under the factor of economic incentives, strong positive relationships were identified between disposal costs and collection and sorting costs, thus increasing waste disposal charging fee may promote recycling behaviour. In comparison, accreditation scheme deserved better recognition to facilitate a closed-loop material flow in the construction industry. These findings help to devise more effective and stakeholder-oriented policy tools to raise awareness and encourage behavioural change towards C&D waste recycling, and assist policy makers to establish regulations and practices for sustainable resource management.}

We conducted household interviews using a structured questionnaire, with questions on characteristics, quantities, and behaviors of acquisition, replacement, storage, repair, and destination for 26 electric and electronic equipment (EEE) categories. Each household had on average 21 EEE (95% confidence interval [CI]: 19.7–21.7), of which 18 were in use and 3 were out-of-use. Out-of-use storage was common, occurring in 72.6% of households. Discarded EEE (i.e., e-waste) was destined for intended reuse (59.5%; 95% CI: 57.4–61.5%), recycling (20.4%; 95% CI: 18.8–22.1%), and, particularly for small EEE, municipal waste (16.0%; 95% CI: 14.5–17.6%). Other aspects of domestic e-waste flow (e.g., place and time of acquisition, second-hand acquisition, donation, intention to repair damaged EEE, and storage) were quantified and related to actions for public policies. This research shows that household surveys are useful for obtaining primary data to verify consumer behavior toward EEE. We expect the findings of this study to support decision-making for public policies related to e-waste management, particularly in countries where reverse logistics systems are in the initial phase of implementation.}

However, so far, studies considered inhibitors of IRR transport under logistics shippers or forwarders' perspectives. Unfortunately, no existing research has evaluated the interrelationships of IRR freight transport inhibitors in emerging economies, nor in Indian Context. This study aims to give a structural model of IRR freight transport inhibitors interrelationships with a case of the Indian freight industry. The considered stakeholders in the present research are academic researchers, freight shippers, and Indian Railways officials’. The considered research framework presents twenty-two inhibitors, that were selected from the previous literature and experts' input. Then, a blend of grey theory and decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory method (Grey-DEMATEL) was used to identify the causal relationships between the selected inhibitors and the strength of their interrelationships. A Euclidian distance analysis was used to highlight the similarities and differences between stakeholders’ views. All the stakeholders find some common inhibitors such as poor rail freight transport infrastructure, low frequency of freight trains, the poor delivery reliability of rail mode, lack of competition between transport modes, and lack of holistic transportation business model. The unique contribution of present work relies on the fact that no past studies were found, to consider the impact of multiple stakeholders in the intermodal freight business. Moreover, policymakers may take proactive actions to improve the inhibitors of IRR into practices for improving modal balance in emerging economies. Finally, the conclusion and limitations of the present work are highlighted.}

Community pharmacies are widely accessible and employ highly trained health care professionals on-site who can initiate PrEP and PEP. Recommendations are offered to implement a community pharmacy PrEP program. Pharmacy, government, and HIV prevention leaders must be prepared to support and promote transformative changes, including (1) modification or expansion of existing state-specific scope of practice to initiate PrEP and PEP, (2) encouraging pharmacist education about PrEP and PEP, (3) identification and screening of candidates for PrEP eligibility, (4) incorporating pharmacy laboratory ordering and monitoring logistics, (5) adjusting workflow and ensuring confidential spaces for sensitive discussions, and (6) addressing reimbursement to maintain pharmacist-delivered PrEP and PEP programs. HIV disproportionately affects minority communities and younger individuals who may not be engaged in the health care system. Community pharmacies are accessible and can help increase PrEP use. Expansion of community pharmacy PrEP programs are needed to help end the HIV epidemic. Implementation of PrEP requires adaptation of the pharmacy profession to support incorporation of PrEP in a community pharmacy. Endorsement and support of community pharmacists are needed to implement PrEP to increase HIV prevention efforts and expand pharmacists’ scope of practice.}

abstract = {Αbstract
The interpretation of geologic processes on Mars from sparse meteorite, remote sensing and rover data is influenced by knowledge gained from well-characterized terrestrial analogues. This calls for detailed study of candidate terrestrial analogues and comparison of their observable features to those encountered on the surface of Mars. We evaluated the mineralogical, geochemical, and physical properties of the Balos cove basalts (BCB) from the island of Santorini and compared them to Martian meteorites, Mars rover surface measurements, and other verified Martian analogues obtained from the International Space Analogue Rockstore (ISAR). Twenty rock samples were collected from the Balos cove area based on their freshness, integrity, and basaltic appearance in the field. Optical microscopy of BCB revealed a pilotaxitic to trachytic texture, with olivine and clinopyroxene phenocrysts in a fine groundmass of olivine, clinopyroxene, plagioclase, magnetite, and devitrified glass. All major minerals show normal zoning, including calcic plagioclase (An78–85 at the core and An60–76 at the rim), augite (En36-48Wo41-44Fs11–21), and olivine (Fo74–88). The dominant bands in the infrared-attenuated total reflectance (IR-ATR) spectra from BCB can be assigned to olivine (~875 cm−1), calcic plagioclase (~1130 cm−1), and augite (~970 cm−1). The whole-rock chemical compositions and mineralogy of the BCB are similar to published analyses of typical olivine-phyric shergottites and basalts and basaltic materials analyzed in Gusev and Gale craters on Mars. BCB porosity is in the range of 7–15% and is similar to the porosities of the ISAR samples. Although no terrestrial rock is ever a perfect match to Martian compositions, the differences in mineralogy and geochemistry between BCB and some classes of Martian samples are relatively subtle and the basalts of Santorini are as close a match as other accepted Mars basalt analogues. The Santorini site offers excellent field logistics that, together with the petrology of the outcrop, makes it a valuable locality for testing and calibration deployments, field training, and other activities related to current and future Mars exploration.}

abstract = {Objective
Integrated thoracic surgery residency program (IP) applicants often complete away rotations to stand out from the objective standard criteria. Little is known about the perceptions of these rotations. We aimed to examine the perceptions of value, cost, and expectations of away rotations among IP applicants and program directors.
Design
Between March and April 2020, anonymous electronic surveys were distributed through e-mails gathered from the Electronic Residency Application Service and the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education IP email list. A follow-up email was sent to all applicants and program directors 1 week after the initial request to improve response rate. Questions assessed the cost, frequency, goals, and objectives for away rotations, as well as the perceived value of these experiences.
Setting
United States
Participants
All IP program directors and United States senior medical students who applied to our institution's IP during the 2019-2020 cycle.
Results
Seventy-eight US medical students participated in the 2020 IP Match with 65 applicants applying to our institution's IP. Thirty-three responses were obtained from applicants who applied to our program (51% response rate). Survey responses were obtained from 8 program directors (31% response rate). Ninety-four percent of applicant respondents completed an IP away rotation (n = 31). Fifty-seven percent of these applicants spent on average $5000 in total for away rotations (n = 19). Overall, applicants felt that away rotations helped refine their perception of program location, educational and operative experience, treatment of medical students, and collegiality. Applicants and program directors acknowledged that creating a good impression and finding a compatible program were central values for participating in away rotations. However, program directors viewed the overall strength of the applicant as the most important factor when evaluating applicants. Fifty-five percent of applicant respondents matched at an IP (n = 17) with 35% matching at an IP where they had completed an away rotation (n = 6).
Conclusion
Extended interactions that can help create good impressions and establish compatibility are benefits to away rotations. However, given the current application conditions imposed by the pandemic, future studies should examine the impact of no away rotations on the IP Match process so that moving forward applicants and program directors can continue to weigh benefits to the costs and logistics of completing an away rotation.}

The bioeconomy is expected to be a key solution to supply societies with food and non-food products while replacing non-renewable resources and preserving natural ones. Sustainability of bioeconomy systems is currently an issue that has to be addressed. Current research dealing with the bioeconomy focuses primarily on technologies to improve biomass transformation and, with regard to sustainability, on simple and unitary bio-based value chains such as biofuel production from a single crop. In this paper, based on a literature review, we highlight the complexity of bioeconomy systems and propose a framework to support their sustainable development. We first review the key characteristics of bioeconomy systems: a wide variety of stakeholders with a limited vision of bioeconomy systems, flexibility but also rigidity of biomass feedstocks or transformation processes and a complex spatio-temporal layout. Drawing on sustainability science, we show the relevance of the social-ecological concept to approach territorial bioeconomy systems' sustainably and develop an analytical framework to address sustainable development of territorial (local/regional) bioeconomy systems. This framework is based on two complementary representations of territorial bioeconomy systems, used to decipher their complexity. Finally, we outline an integrated assessment and modelling approach designed to tackle specific bioeconomy sustainability issues. This participatory approach has to take into account: i) the different sub-systems of territorial bioeconomy systems, their high level of interactions, their heterogeneity in terms of entities and processes involved and the circularity of matter and energy (production, transformation, use and recycling) with particular emphasis on the transformation sub-system and the logistics ii) the multiplicity and flexibility of stakeholders’ nature, strategies and concerns, iii) the variety of spatial and temporal scales at play; iv) the effects of exogenous drivers like supra-regional policies and regulations, markets (e.g. prices of energies and biomass-based products) and climate.}

Resilience assessment for the wine industry to date has largely focused on characterising risks and responses as a function of organisational and business management practices. Less in known about socio-ecological characteristics of resilience and how these shape and influence response capabilities and capacity to low-frequency, high-magnitude events within the broader context of other risks. The research employs a resilience-based framework to identify and assess relevant properties incorporating a whole-of-value-chain perspective. The participatory approach includes semi-structured interviews with stakeholders, including wine business managers, wine researchers, industry bodies and others involved in the production and distribution of wine; document analysis (media and emergency response reports), and insurance assessments. Results show the earthquake had direct impacts on infrastructure, with indirect impacts and implications in particular for transportation and logistics, affecting the industry’s ability to mitigate losses. Resilience varies across the region and the industry, in part as a function of size, scale, and ownership structure of the operation, which in turn influences future levels of preparedness. Resilience analysis provides conceptual and methodological tools for assessing the capacity of socio-ecological systems to recover from shocks and stresses. The framework developed here provides a useful conceptual and theoretical basis for further assessments and can inform the design of resilience indices to monitor organisations’ capacity to absorb shocks and prepare for future uncertainty. This type of analysis can help identify system-critical vulnerabilities and sensitivities and inform the development of strategies to develop specified and general resilience in the face of multiple stressors.}

It is expected that the consumption of gasoline and diesel fuel reaching a maximum in 2030–2035, may decrease by 2050 in comparison with 2015 under the innovative scenario by 5.4 times and 12%, respectively, and under the “1.5 degrees” scenario — by 13.6 times and 1.7 times. In the given period, according to the innovative scenario, natural gas consumption is expected to increase by 6.2 times. However, if the “1.5 degrees” scenario is implemented, the consumption of natural gas as a motor fuel may stop by 2050. At the same time, natural gas can be used for the production of environmentally friendly motor fuel — hydrogen, as well as electric energy for electric vehicles. The total gross greenhouse gas emissions of the motor vehicle fleet may reach a maximum in 2030 (194 million tons of CO2) but then they will decrease by 2050 according to the inertial scenario to 189.5 million tons, the innovative scenario — to 142.6 million tons and the “1.5 degrees” scenario — to 103.1 million tons of CO2. If the “1.5 degrees” scenario is implemented, in 2050, direct greenhouse gas emissions from the combustion of petroleum motor fuels by the motor vehicle fleet will be almost 2 times less than indirect CO2 emissions from the combustion of natural gas at thermal power plants in the production of electric energy for electric vehicles. It is expected that if the Russian economy and transport switch to a low-carbon development path, decarbonization of the vehicle fleet can be achieved after 2054.}

abstract = {Introduction
Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) can treat cardiac arrest refractory to conventional therapies. Many institutions are interested in developing their own ECPR program. However, there may be challenges in logistics and implementation.
Aims
The aim of our protocol was to demonstrate that an ECPR team was feasible within our healthcare system and that the identification of UPMC Presbyterian as a receiving center allowed for successful treatment within 30 min from EMS dispatch.
Methods
We developed out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) ECPR protocols for Emergency Medical Services (EMS), EMS communications, and our in-hospital ECPR team. Inclusion criteria indentified patients with a potentially reversible arrest etiology and high probability of recoverable brain injury using a simple checklist: witnessed collapse, layperson CPR, initial shockable rhythm, and age 18–60 years. We trained local EMS crews to screen patients and reviewed the criteria with a Medic Command Physician prior to transport to our hospital.
Results
From October 2015 to March 31st 2018, EMS treated 1165 EMS OHCA cases, transported 664 (57%) to a local hospital, and transported 120 (10%) to our institution. Of these, five (4.1%) patients underwent ECPR. Among excluded cases, 64 (53%) had nonshockable rhythms, 48 (40%) were unwitnessed arrests, 50 (42%) were over age 60 and the remaining 20 (17%) had no documented reasons for exclusion. For ECPR cases, median pre-hospital CPR duration was 26 [IQR 25–40] min. Four patients (80%) received mechanical CPR. Interval from arrest to arrival on scene was 5 [IQR 4–6] min and interval from radio call to activation of ECPR was 13 [IQR 7–21] min. Interval from EMS dispatch to departure from scene was 20 [IQR 19–21] min. Time from EMS dispatch to initiation of ECPR was 63 [IQR 59–69] min.
Conclusions
ECPR is an infrequent occurrence in EMS practice. Most apparently eligible patients did not get ECPR, highlighting the need for ongoing programmatic development, provider education, and qualitative work exploring barriers to implementation.}

abstract = {ABSTRACT
Fatty acid (FA) composition is one of the most important aspects of milk nutritional quality. However, the inclusion of this trait as a breeding goal for dairy species is hampered by the logistics and high costs of phenotype recording. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) is a valid and cheap alternative to laboratory gas chromatography (GC) for predicting milk FA composition. Moreover, as for other novel phenotypes, the efficiency of selection for these traits can be enhanced by using genomic data. The objective of this research was to compare traditional versus genomic selection approaches for estimating genetic parameters and breeding values of milk fatty acid composition in dairy sheep using either GC-measured or FTIR-predicted FA as phenotypes. Milk FA profiles were available for a total of 923 Sarda breed ewes. The youngest 100 had their own phenotype masked to mimic selection candidates. Pedigree relationship information and genotypes were available for 923 and 769 ewes, respectively. Three statistical approaches were used: the classical-pedigree-based BLUP, the genomic BLUP that considers the genomic relationship matrix G, and the single-step genomic BLUP (ssGBLUP) where pedigree and genomic relationship matrices are blended into a single H matrix. Heritability estimates using pedigree were lower than ssGBLUP, and very similar between GC and FTIR regarding the statistical approach used. For some FA, mostly associated with animal diet (i.e., C18:2n-6, C18:3n-3), random effect of combination of flock and test date explained a relevant quota of total variance, reducing the heritability estimates accordingly. Genomic approaches (genomic BLUP and ssGBLUP) outperformed the traditional pedigree method both for GC and FTIR FA. Prediction accuracies in the older cohort were larger than the young cohort. Genomic prediction accuracies (obtained using either G or H relationship matrix) in the young cohort of animals, where their own phenotypes were masked, were similar for GC and FTIR. Multiple-trait analysis slightly affected genomic breeding value accuracies. These results suggest that FTIR-predicted milk FA composition could represent a valid option for inclusion in breeding programs.}

abstract = {Background
Wellness is crucial to provider well-being and better patient outcomes. Assessment of trainee wellness occurs infrequently and misses the fluctuation of wellness at the individual trainee level. To address this gap, we piloted Wellness Fuel Tank (WFT), a phone-texting communication tool prompting trainees to self-assess personal wellness.
Methods
Residents were educated on objectives and logistics of WFT through in-person discussion and email. Participation was voluntary and trainees could opt out at any time. Trainees received weekly text messages prompting self-assessment of their wellness level from 0 (empty) to 4 (full). Residents could share comments about personal and program wellness. Text exchanges concluded with institutional support resources. Trainees with empty or quarter-full levels were contacted to offer support and facilitate resource allocation. This pilot ran 1/10-6/20/19.
Outcomes
Sixty-four percent of residents (47/73) utilized WFT at least once, totaling 436 responses. On average, 25% of residents participated weekly. Participation waned: 44% peak (week 2) down-trending to 15% (week 24). One resident opted out. Mean WFT levels were 2.9+/-0.6 and remained steady. Fifteen (21%) trainees reported 19 instances (4% of responses) of low wellness levels attributed to learning environment (n=6,32%), personal (n=5,26%), academic (n=4,21%), and/or family (n=1,5%) issues. Themes contributing to low WFT were fatigue (workload, sleep, consecutive workdays), illness, death, poor treatment by supervisor, and impaired self-care (exercise, eating, family time). Trainees submitted 138 comments (32% of responses); low fuel tank levels correlated with more comments. Project build cost $2700; weekly expenditure totals $2. Two hours were dedicated weekly to project administration.
Implications
WFT is a cost-efficient resource that provides residents with a simple outlet for communicating wellness levels and ideas with leadership. Significant numbers of trainees voluntarily reported low wellness levels, although overall occurrence was infrequent. Our analysis suggests that WFT provides meaningful opportunities for communication about trainee and program wellness.}

abstract = {In last mile distribution, logistics companies typically arrange and plan their routes based on broad estimates of stop delivery times (i.e., the time spent at each stop to deliver goods to final receivers). If these estimates are not accurate, the level of service is degraded, as the promised time window may not be satisfied. The purpose of this work is to assess the feasibility of machine learning techniques to predict stop delivery times. This is done by testing a wide range of machine learning techniques (including different types of ensembles) to (1) predict the stop delivery time and (2) to determine whether the total stop delivery time will exceed a predefined time threshold (classification approach). For the assessment, all models are trained using information generated from GPS data collected in Medellín, Colombia and compared to hazard duration models. The results are threefold. First, the assessment shows that regression-based machine learning approaches are not better than conventional hazard duration models concerning absolute errors of the prediction of the stop delivery times. Second, when the problem is addressed by a classification scheme in which the prediction is aimed to guide whether a stop time will exceed a predefined time, a basic K-nearest-neighbor model outperforms hazard duration models and other machine learning techniques both in accuracy and F1 score (harmonic mean between precision and recall). Third, the prediction of the exact duration can be improved by combining the classifiers and prediction models or hazard duration models in a two level scheme (first classification then prediction). However, the improvement depends largely on the correct classification (first level).}

abstract = {The development of transportation networks has constantly increased the cross-boundary flow of people, logistics, and capital. However, when the cross-boundary flows span two regions with different political systems, cross-boundary mobility studies become difficult to perform due to the unavailability of reliable and direct research data. Consequently, in-depth and fine-scale cross-boundary mobility studies remain lacking. With the aid of a smart card dataset, this paper proposes a new framework to break the deadlock in cross-boundary travel behavior studies. Drawing on a 35-day Shenzhen smart card dataset, our study aims to unravel the Hong Kong cross-boundary travelers' mobility patterns in Shenzhen on the basis of the assumption that some Hong Kong cross-boundary travelers who travel through checkpoints to Shenzhen hold a Shenzhen metro smart card to use the Shenzhen metro system easily and rapidly. Through this assumption, we develop a method for identifying travel by Hong Kongers visiting Shenzhen. To our best knowledge, this study is the first to use emerging big data to explore a fine-scale cross-boundary travel behavior between Hong Kong and mainland China. The research results can be summarized in two aspects. (1) Temporal features: Hong Kongers mostly prefer weekends and afternoon periods (11 a.m.-6 p.m.) to travel to Shenzhen, but they have a considerably low cross-boundary travel frequency (54.5% travel only once in 35 days). When they are traveling in Shenzhen, they usually take only two metro trips, spending approximately 15 min in the subway; their duration in Shenzhen is approximately 4.5 h on weekends, and is slightly longer on holidays (5.02 h) and shorter on workdays (4.09 h). (2) Spatial features: some Hong Kongers tend to take Shenzhen as the transfer stop for going to other cities. The travel spatial scope of Hong Kong cross-boundary travelers is almost confined to the center area of Shenzhen. They prefer to travel to nearby and mature business districts well equipped with commercial service facilities, such as Laojie, Guomao, Shopping Park, and Grand Theater.}

abstract = {BACKGROUND
Non invasive cardiac radio-ablation (RA) has emerged as an alternative to escalating anti arrhythmic drugs (AADs) in patients who are unwilling or unable to undergo catheter ablation (CA) for recurrent ventricular tachycardia (VT). We present our initial experience of treating 9 patients on a compassionate use basis and offer insights into programme development and delivery in Canada.
METHODS AND RESULTS
Twenty four patients have been referred to the programme since August 2019. We have treated 9 patients with RA as 12 patients declined and another three underwent emergent CA for VT storm. Of the 15 patients who did not receive RA, 10 are now deceased (67%). Following RA one patient (11%) deceased at 11 months due to respiratory infection. Although highly selective, clinical characteristics between those receiving and not receiving RA are similar. Patients undergoing RA are medically stabilised and receive echo, CT and PET scanning similar to patients undergoing CA. All 9 patients underwent non invasive EP study (NIPS) under light sedation administered by a single IV cannula without complication. VT is induced using the ICD in situ and mapped using the CardioInsight ECGi system. Targets for RA are identified combining the ECGi data with the contemporaneous imaging data. This analogue process involves Cardiac EP/ Imaging, Radiation Oncologists and Medical Physicists. The median time to RA from NIPS is 12 working days (IQR 8, 20). A single fraction of 25 Gy is targeted using 4D-CT with an average on beam time of 15 minutes. All patients receive Rivaroxaban 20 mg for thirty days post RA. Thus far 1 patient (11%) has suffered pneumonitis requiring a 4 week course of oral corticosteroids, but there have been no other adverse events attributable to RA. Post RA 8 patients (89%) experienced an immediate reduction in VT burden as recorded by their ICD. As compared to the 6 months prior to RA, there was a greater than 90% reduction in VT requiring ICD therapy (ATP or shocks) and at 9 months only 1 patient (11%) has suffered recurrent ICD shocks. The majority of patients (67%) have had antiarrhythmic drug therapy reduced or withdrawn post RA.
CONCLUSION
Non invasive cardiac radioablation appears safe, well tolerated and effective in the short term for those unwilling or unable to receive catheter ablation for recurrent VT. Several opportunities remain to improve logistics, targeting and availability of the procedure to improve outcomes for this cohort of patients in Canada.}

abstract = {Background
Characterizing the complexity of environmental exposures in relation to human health is critical to advancing our understanding of health and disease throughout the life span. Extant cohort studies open the door for such investigations more rapidly and inexpensively than launching new cohort studies and the Human Health Exposure Analysis Resource (HHEAR) provides a resource for implementing life-stage exposure studies within existing study populations. Primary challenges to incorporation of environmental exposure assessment in health studies include: (1) lack of widespread knowledge of biospecimen and environmental sampling and storage requirements for environmental exposure assessment among investigators; (2) lack of availability of and access to laboratories capable of analyzing multiple environmental exposures throughout the life-course; and (3) studies lacking sufficient power to assess associations across life-stages. HHEAR includes a consortium of researchers with expertise in laboratory analyses, statistics and logistics to overcome these limitations and enable inclusion of exposomics in human health studies.
Objective
This manuscript describes the structure and strengths of implementing the harmonized HHEAR resource model, and our approaches to addressing challenges. We describe how HHEAR incorporates analyses of biospecimens and environmental samples and human health studies across the life span - serving as a model for incorporating environmental exposures into national and international research. We also present program successes to date.
Discussion
HHEAR provides a full-service laboratory and data analysis exposure assessment resource, linking scientific, life span, and toxicological consultation with both laboratory and data analysis expertise. HHEAR services are provided without cost but require NIH, NCI, NHLBI, or ECHO funding of the original cohort; internal HHEAR scientific review and approval of a brief application; and adherence to data sharing and publication policies. We describe the benefits of HHEAR's structure, collaborative framework and coordination across project investigators, analytical laboratories, biostatisticians and bioinformatics specialists; quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) including integrated sample management; and tools that have been developed to support the research (exposure information pages, ontology, new analytical methods, common QA/QC approach across laboratories, etc.). This foundation supports HHEAR's inclusion of new laboratory and statistical analysis methods and studies that are enhanced by including targeted analysis of specific exposures and untargeted analysis of chemicals associated with phenotypic endpoints in biological and environmental samples.
Conclusion
HHEAR is an interdisciplinary team of toxicologists, epidemiologists, laboratory scientists, and data scientists across multiple institutions to address broad and complex questions that benefit from integrated laboratory and data analyses. HHEAR's processes, features, and tools include all life stages and analysis of biospecimens and environmental samples. They are available to the wider scientific community to augment studies by adding state of the art environmental analyses to be linked to human health outcomes.}

abstract = {Lowland irrigated rice in southern Brazil is typically grown in monoculture, with one rice crop per year. However, during the past 10 years, some farmers have switched from the traditional continuous rice system to a 2-y soybean-rice rotation. Here we performed an on-farm assessment about the impact of introducing soybean to the lowland continuous rice system in southern Brazil. The goal was to determine how the soybean-rice rotation compared to continuous rice in terms of yield and profit. We used farmer-reported survey data collected from lowland rice-based systems in southern Brazil over three growing seasons. Cropping-system yield, profit, and return-to-inputs were compared between fields following continuous rice versus soybean–rice rotation. In addition to the survey data analysis, we evaluated the long-term economic impact of adopting the rotation using a combination of a crop simulation model and Monte-Carlo stochastic modeling. Average rice yield was 26% higher in the rotation compared to continuous rice. Besides the rotation effect, sowing date, N fertilizer, and weed management explained most of the field-to-field variability in rice yield. Cropping-system yield and gross income were lower in the soybean-rice rotation than in continuous rice as a result of replacing an irrigated crop (rice) by a water-limited rainfed crop (soybean). Despite that yield penalty, there was no difference in net economic return between the two cropping systems due to lower production costs in soybean-rice rotation compared to continuous rice. The rotation also exhibited smaller labor requirement and higher benefit-to-cost ratio and return to labor than continuous rice. Despite these potential benefits, our long-term analysis indicated higher inter-annual variability and economic risk in the rotation compared to continuous rice. Other factors further constrain adoption of the soybean-rice rotation, including the high risk of growing soybean in fields that are prone to excess water and difficulties to change current farm logistics. Findings from this study are relevant to other rice-based systems in the world looking for opportunities to increase or maintain net profit while reducing costs and/or labor.}

The choices a society makes, whether at a local or national level, can allow or ban fracking, require a specific percentage of renewable energy, support increased use of nuclear power, or do away with it altogether. Such policies have been implemented in Pennsylvania and New York, Germany, France, and Sweden. In a world with increasing greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels, global energy policies are needed to curb climate change. This is not something that cannot be remediated by economics or technology alone, but requires political cooperation among governments. Another policy issue relates to energy poverty in the underdeveloped world. Even in this day and age, there are still about a billion people on Earth without access to electricity who use oil lamps for light and burn wood for heating and cooking. The United Nations goal is to electrify the world by 2030, but it is not clear how they intend to implement it. A third important policy issue is energy sustainability. The energy model presently in use in the world is not sustainable and even with the current abundance of shale gas and tight oil, these resources are finite and will eventually run out. Long before we reach that point, some significant thought needs to be given to the logistics of switching to a more sustainable energy mix in a responsible and economic manner. Political calls for a “Green New Deal” are admirable, but without an implementation strategy, they are just politics.}

This is the first study to analyse the environmental sustainability aspect of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from a global wine supply chain perspective, covering just over 90% of Finland's wine imports. Lacking substantial domestic production capacity, virtually all wine consumed in Finland is imported. Finland is comparable to its Nordic neighbours, Sweden and Norway, in this respect. The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology was combined with sensitivity and scenario analyses to investigate GHG emissions implications from prospective policy changes. Our results spotlight differences related to wine production in the eight main wine producing countries for the Finnish market (Australia, Chile, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, South Africa, and the United States), related logistics, and all packaging types for wine used in Finland (glass bottle, Bag-in-Box, PET bottle, beverage carton, and pouch). We found an average value of 1.23 kg CO2e for 0.75 L wine consumed in Finland, ranging from 0.59 kg CO2e for French wine in a bag-in-box packaging to 1.92 kg CO2e for Australian wine in a glass bottle. After identifying the main GHG emission hotspots in the wine supply chain, our scenario analyses highlight the effects of reducing glass bottle weight, moving away from glass packaging toward bag-in-box, increasing bulk wine export volumes to Finland, and following the European Commission's Energy 2020 strategy which targets increasing energy efficiency by 20 percent.}

Defining the future location and supply logistics of conversion plants is imperative to ultimately transform the nation’s renewable biomass resources into cost-competitive, high-performance feedstock for production of biofuels and bioproducts. Since the US has put restrictions on production levels of conventional biofuels from edible resources, the nation needs to plan for the widespread accessibility and development of the cellulosic biofuel scenario. Conventional feedstock supply systems will be unable to handle cellulosic biomass nationwide, making it essential to expand the industry with an advanced feedstock supply system incorporating a distributed network of preprocessing depots and conversion plants, or biorefineries. Current studies are mostly limited to designing supply systems for specific regions of the country. We developed a national database with potential locations for depots and biorefineries to meet the nation’s target demand of cellulosic biofuel. Blended feedstock with switchgrass and corn stover (harvested by either a two- or three-pass method) are considered in a Mixed Integer Linear Programming model to deliver on-spec biomass that considers both, a desired quantity and quality at the biorefinery. The model solves for a network of varying size depots that supply to biorefineries of 725,000 dry tons/year. A total delivered feedstock cost that is less than $79.07/dry tons (2016$) is evaluated for years 2022, 2030, and 2040. In 2022, 124 depots and 59 biorefineries could be supplied with 42.8 million dt of corn stover and switchgrass. In 2030 and 2040, the total accessible biomass could increase to 215% and 393% respectively when compared to 2022. However, an $8/dry tons reduction in targeted delivery cost could reduce total accessible biomass by 67%. Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota and Texas were identified as potential states with a strong biofuel economy given that they had six or more biorefineries located in all scenarios. In some scenarios, Colorado, Alabama, Georgia, Minnesota, Mississippi and South Carolina would greatly benefit from a depot network as these could only deliver to a biorefinery in a nearby state. To elaborate the impact of a nationwide consideration, the findings were compared with existing literature for different US regions. We also present results for biorefinery capacities that are double, triple and quadruple in size.}

Many populations in nature such as plants or animals are characterized by aggregation of tendencies, introducing a big challenge to sampling. Regardless, a biased or imprecise inference would mislead analysis, hence the conclusion and policymaking. Systematic adaptive cluster sampling (SACS) is design-unbiased and particularly efficient for inventorying spatially clustered populations. However, (1) oversampling is common for nonrare variables, making SACS a difficult choice for inventorying common forest attributes or ecological indicators; (2) a SACS sample is not completely specified until the field campaign is completed, making advance budgeting and logistics difficult; (3) even for rare variables, uncertainty regarding the final sample still persists; and (4) a SACS sample may be variable-specific as its formation can be adapted to a particular attribute or indicator, thus risking imbalance or non-representativeness for other jointly observed variables. Consequently, to solve these challenges, we aim to develop a generalized SACS (GSACS) with respect to the design and estimators, and to illustrate its connections with systematic sampling (SS) as has been widely employed by national forest inventories and ecological observation networks around the world. In addition to theoretical derivations, empirical sampling distributions were validated and compared for GSACS and SS using sampling simulations that incorporated a comprehensive set of forest populations exhibiting different spatial patterns. Five conclusions are relevant: (1) in contrast to SACS, GSACS explicitly supports inventorying forest attributes and ecological indicators that are nonrare, and solved SACS problems of oversampling, uncertain sample form, and sample imbalance for alternative attributes or indicators; (2) we demonstrated that SS is a special case of GSACS; (3) even with fewer sample plots, GSACS gives estimates identical to SS; (4) GSACS outperforms SS with respect to inventorying clustered populations and for making domain-specific estimates; and (5) the precision in design-based inference is negatively correlated with the prevalence of a spatial pattern, the range of spatial autocorrelation, and the sample plot size, in a descending order.}

Previous efforts generally produce crop planting area maps after harvest and early season cropping information is rarely available. New opportunities emerge with rapid increase in satellite data acquisition and cloud computing platform such as Google Earth Engine (GEE) which can access and process a vast volume of multi-sensor images. Here we aimed to examine earliest identifiable timing (EIT) of major crops (rice, soybean, and corn) and generate early season crop maps independent of within-year field surveys in the Heilongjiang province, one most important province of grain production in China. The Random Forest classifiers were trained based on early season images and field samples in 2017, then were transferred (applied) to corresponding images in 2018 to obtain resultant maps. Six scenarios with different temporal intervals (10d, 15d, 20d, and 30d) and data integration (Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1, a total of 16, 450 images) were compared to get the optimal crop maps. The results showed that the Sentinel-2 time series and 10-day composite outperformed in obtaining EITs and crop maps. We found various EITs for the three grain staples. Specifically, rice could be identified in the late transplanting stage (four months before harvest) with F1 score of 0.93, following by corn recognizable in the early heading stage (two months before harvest, with F1 score of 0.92) and soybean in the early pod setting stage (50 days before harvest, with F1 score of 0.91). The crop maps in the EITs based on the classifier transfer approach have comparable accuracies (overall accuracy = 0.91) comparing to the traditional post-season mapping approach based on current year’s all available images and samples (overall accuracy = 0.95). This study suggests the potential of growing fine resolution observations for timely monitoring of crop planting area within season, which provides valuable and timely information for different stakeholders and decision makers.}

abstract = {Context
Identifying and developing resilient farming and food systems has emerged as a top priority during the Covid-19 pandemic. Many academics suggest that farming and food systems should move towards agroecological models to achieve better resilience. However, there was limited evidence to support this statement during the Covid-19 pandemic.
Objective
Our objectives were to report evidence for the resilience of French organic dairy cattle farms and supply chains to the Covid-19 pandemic and to discuss the features of those farms and supply chains that promoted resilience.
Methods
We combined online surveys with farmers, semi-structured interviews with supply chain actors and a review of the gray and technical literature, and whenever possible, we compared this qualitative data against quantitative industry data. We also asked farmers to rank 19 pre-identified risks according to their likelihood and potential impacts.
Results and conclusions
We showed the pandemic had zero to moderate impacts on most farms. Among respondents, 38 farmers reported no impacts, another 43 experienced minor impacts on aspects such as their income and workload while only 5 faced major impacts, such as the closure of sales outlets. Most farms were family farms and were not greatly affected by worker availability issues. Moreover, the vast majority of these farms were nearly autonomous for livestock feeding and none reported input supply shortages or related impacts on farm functioning and productivity. The pandemic had moderate impacts on supply chains. Despite staff reductions, supply chains continued producing sufficient amounts of dairy products to meet consumer demand. To do so, they narrowed the scope of products manufactured to concentrate on a basic mix: milk, cream, butter and plain yogurt. Logistics were also adapted by hiring retired drivers to keep up with milk collection and reorganizing the delivery of products by shunting usual sub-level platforms that were saturated. Consequently, even after this pandemic, farmers remained more concerned with climate change-related risks on their farms than by sanitary risks. Several resilience factors were identified that promoted buffer and adaptive capacity at the farm level and that favored adaptive capacity at the supply chain level.
Significance
These findings confirm the relevance of agroecological models in achieving resilience in farming and food systems against shocks such as the Covid-19 pandemic. This preliminary work carried out at the end of the first lock-down period needs to be pursued in order to understand the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic over longer time horizons.}

abstract = {Last (and First) mile deliveries are an increasingly important and costly component of supply chains especially those that require transport within city centres. With reduction in anticipated manufacturing and delivery timescales, logistics personnel are expected to identify the correct location (accurately) and supply the goods in appropriate condition (safe delivery). Moving towards more environmentally sustainable supply chains, the last/first mile of deliveries may be completed by a cyclist courier which could result in significant reductions in congestion and emissions in cities. In addition, the last metres of an increasing number of deliveries are completed on foot i.e. as a pedestrian. Although research into new technologies to support enhanced navigation capabilities is ongoing, the focus to date has been on technical implementations with limited studies addressing how information is perceived and actioned by a human courier. In the research reported in this paper a comparison study has been conducted with 24 participants evaluating two examples of state-of-the-art navigation aids to support accurate (right time and place) and safe (right condition) navigation. Participants completed 4 navigation tasks, 2 whilst cycling and 2 whilst walking. The navigation devices under investigation were a handheld display presenting a map and instructions and an in-sight monocular display presenting text and arrow instructions. Navigation was conducted in a real-world environment in which eye movements and device interaction were recorded using Tobii-Pro 2 eye tracking glasses. The results indicate that the handheld device provided better support for accurate navigation (right time and place), with longer but less frequent gaze interactions and higher perceived usability. The in-sight display supported improved situation awareness with a greater number of hazards acknowledged. The benefits and drawbacks of each device and use of visual navigation support tools are discussed.}

abstract = {Background
Despite increased use of arterial grafts, the long saphenous vein (LSV) is often utilised as conduit for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). Preoperative ultrasound (U/S) vein assessment is limited to patients with varicosities, clinical signs suggestive of poor vein conduits and a history of cardiac or vascular surgery. The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness and logistics of the surgeon incorporating intraoperative U/S assessment of the LSV into their regular practice.
Methods
All patients undergoing coronary artery revascularisation and open vein harvest in our institution were recruited from July 2016 to February 2017. Demographics, including known risk factors for wound complications were documented, in addition to surgical details such as harvest time, vein length and surgical repairs of the conduit. Focussed U/S assessment was performed intraoperatively by the surgical registrar before beginning the procedure. The diameter of the leg pre and postoperatively, as well as the incidence, type and severity of wound complications were documented for further statistical analysis.
Results
A total of 103 patients were included in this study. Two patients died perioperatively and were excluded from the study. The remaining 101 patients were separated in two cohorts—U/S group (n=32) and blind technique group (n=69). Demographics were similar between the groups, whilst other risk factors for harvest complications, such as presence of superficial varicosities on clinical examination and renal failure were significantly more frequent in the U/S group. The median harvest time was significantly lower within the U/S group (25 mins versus 40 mins; p=0.001), as was the rate of overall wound complications (6.2% vs 23.2%; p=0.04).
Conclusions
Ultrasound assessment of the LSV by the surgical team intraoperatively is feasible, easy to learn and does not demand extra costs or delays. It significantly reduces surgical harvest time and it is associated with a reduced incidence of wound complications, swelling and postoperative mobility impairment.}

abstract = {The Flexible Lunar Architecture for Exploration (FLARE) is a concept to deliver four crew to the lunar surface for a minimum of seven days and then return them safely to Earth. FLARE can be implemented whenever the component vehicles are operational. FLARE was developed as an alternative to NASA's Human Landing System (HLS) reference architecture from the Design Analysis Cycle (DAC) #2 created in 2019. The DAC2 guidelines required utilization of the Gateway vehicle in a Near- Rectilinear Halo Orbit (NRHO). Instead, FLARE chooses a Low Lunar Frozen Polar Orbit (LLFPO) for lunar rendezvous of components, and an optional Gateway vehicle. The LLFPO provides a stable orbit that overflies the south pole every 2 h, ensuring easy access to the lunar surface for surface aborts with a much lower propellant requirement than NRHO. The minimum FLARE concept uses one Space Launch System (SLS) launch, one Orion, one European Service Module (ESM), and one human lander (launched on commercial vehicle(s)). FLARE adds the SpaceTug, based upon the mature and successful ULA “Common” Centaur Upper Stage vehicle, with modifications to create an Earth-Moon transfer vehicle. In the FLARE baseline mission, the SpaceTug provides propulsion needed to return the Orion + ESM from LLFPO to Earth. The SpaceTug also provides propulsion to deliver the separate human lander components – the Descent Element (DE) and the Ascent Element (AE) - from Low Earth Orbit (LEO) to LLFPO. The SLS Block 1 then launches the Orion + ESM and completes a rendezvous with the mated DE + AE components in LLFPO. FLARE offers optional phases beyond the baseline mission. The SpaceTug can deliver components of the planned Gateway, including the Power and Propulsion Element (PPE) and the Habitable and Logistics Outpost (HALO), to LLFPO. FLARE provides an option to deliver precursor equipment to the lunar surface to enhance and extend the human mission. With these components, including an inflatable habitation module and airlock, individual crew mobility vehicle(s), an In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) demonstration, and science and technology experiments, the crew can explore and conduct science on the lunar surface for up to 14 days.}

abstract = {Introduction
Laser Doppler imaging is universally considered the most evidence-based method for objective burn depth assessment by accurately predicting burn wound healing potential. This study has analyzed how exactly laser Doppler imaging measurements can be useful in the early therapeutic decision making for patients with clinically indeterminate depth burns.
Material and methods
An extensive survey, by questionnaire and in-depth interviews, was conducted among 51 burn centers worldwide to gain insight on the practical use of laser Doppler imaging.
Results
Twenty-seven (53%) of the 51 burn centers contacted almost completely answered the 32 questions. Fifty-two percent of these centers (14/27) had at least 10 years of laser Doppler imaging experience. laser Doppler imaging was considered to be mainly or almost completely accurate by 89%. In case of discrepancy between clinical assessment and LDI, 41% relied more on clinical diagnosis, 25% delayed decision to operate, while 16% re-scanned the next day. The centers most experienced with laser Doppler imaging (13%) relied on it more. Final decisions for treatment were based on the combination of laser Doppler imaging and clinical assessment by 74%. Seventy percent of the centers almost never operated burns with laser Doppler imaging-red and would almost always operate burns with LDI-blue. Treatment decisions for intermediate laser Doppler imaging colors (pink, yellow and green) varied, with 76% basing decisions on other factors: % Total Body Surface Area (TBSA), general health, age, location of the burn, potential for colonization/infection, patient preference, compliance with aftercare, logistics, and socio-economic factors.
Conclusion
Laser Doppler imaging reduces the number of clinical indeterminate depth burns. For these intermediate depth burns on laser Doppler imaging, treatment decisions are based on a combination of interpretation (‘man’) and laser Doppler imaging measurements (‘machine’). Thorough knowledge of confounding factors and validated laser Doppler imaging color code, consideration of surrounding laser Doppler imaging colors, the use of mean flux values, and not directly burn related factors are essential. Burn centers with most laser Doppler imaging experience considered laser Doppler imaging an indispensable diagnostic tool.}

abstract = {In recent years, the deployment of Cloud Computing (CC) has become more popular both in research and industry applications, arising form various fields including e-health, manufacturing, logistics and social networking. This is due to the easiness of service deployment and data management, and the unlimited provision of virtual resources (VR). In simple scenarios, users/applications send computational or storage tasks to be executed in the cloud, by manually assigning those tasks to the available computational resources. In complex scenarios, such as a smart city applications, where there is a large number of tasks, VRs, or both, task scheduling is exposed as an NP-Hard problem. Consequently, it is preferred and more efficient in terms of time and effort, to use a task scheduling automation technique. As there are many automated scheduling solutions proposed, new possibilities arise with the advent of Fog Computing (FC) and Blockchain (BC) technologies. Accordingly, such automation techniques may help the quick, secure and efficient assignment of tasks to the available VRs. In this paper, we propose an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm in a Fog-enabled Blockchain-assisted scheduling model, namely PF-BTS. The protocol and algorithms of PF-BTS exploit BC miners for generating efficient assignment of tasks to be performed in the cloud’s VRs using ACO, and award miner nodes for their contribution in generating the best schedule. In our proposal, PF-BTS further allows the fog to process, manage, and perform the tasks to enhance latency measures. While this processing and managing is taking place, the fog is enforced to respect the privacy of system components, and assure that data, location, identity, and usage information are not exposed. We evaluate and compare PF-BTS performance, with a recently proposed Blockchain-based task scheduling protocol, in a simulated environment. Our evaluation and experiments show high privacy awareness of PF-BTS, along with noticeable enhancement in execution time and network load.}

For countries considering the introduction of Dengvaxia, WHO recommends a pre-vaccination screening strategy whereby only persons with evidence of a past dengue infection would be vaccinated. Policy-makers need to consider the risk-benefit of vaccination strategies based on such screening tests, the optimal age to introduce the vaccine, communication and implementation strategies. To address these questions, the Global Dengue and Aedes-transmitted diseases Consortium (GDAC) organized a 3-day workshop in January 2019 with country representatives from Asia and Latin America. The meeting discussions highlighted many challenges in introducing Dengvaxia, in terms of screening test characteristics, costs of such tests combined with a 3-dose schedule, logistics, achieving high coverage rates, vaccine confidence and communication; more challenges than for any other vaccine introduction programme. A screening test would require a high specificity to minimize individual risk, and at the same time high sensitivity to maximize individual and population benefit. The underlying seroprevalence dependent positive predictive value is the best indicator for an acceptable safety profile of a pre-vaccination screening strategy. The working groups discussed many possible implementation strategies. Addressing the bottlenecks in school-based vaccine introduction for Dengvaxia will also benefit other vaccines such as HPV and booster doses for tetanus and pertussis. Levels of public trust are highly variable and context specific, and understanding of population perceptions and concerns is essential to tailor interventions, monitor and mitigate risks.}

abstract = {Purpose/Objective(s)
We have previously demonstrated high patient satisfaction with telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic. During the relaxation of pandemic restrictions, patients are now offered a choice of in person or remote visits. Here we report on the experience of a cohort of patients treated with radiotherapy who opted for fully remote providers.
Materials/Methods
At the time of new visit consultation scheduling, patients were offered fully remote management if availability of onsite providers was limited. Additionally, after initial consultation with the treating oncologist, if patients expressed preference for treatment at a regional facility different from the oncologist's primary site, they were offered treatment at the preferred site with fully remote on-treatment visits, without transfer of care to an onsite provider. Potentially harmful patient safety events and “near-misses” were prospectively collected with an in-house quality improvement reporting system. Patient satisfaction surveys assessing several domains of the patient experience (including appointment logistics, patient-physician communication, and overall impressions) were distributed to patients before, during and after treatment.
Results
From 10/2020 to 2/2021, a total of 192 patients treated to 208 sites opted for fully remote management. 50% were male, 50% female. 61% of patients had metastatic disease. Sites treated included prostate (10%), breast (7%), thoracic (7%), head and neck (2%), gastrointestinal (25%), and other sites including bone, soft tissue and brain (49%). There were 46 minor (no harm or near-miss) patient safety events reported, of which 85% were unrelated to patient condition or physician communication and included events associated with treatment planning, orders, prescriptions and delivery. Minor events related to patient condition and patient scheduling/communication comprised 9% and 6% of events, respectively. There was 1 temporary harm event of patient decompensation in the department requiring activation of emergency services. The safety event rate per patient was similar between this cohort and non-remotely managed patients treated during the same period. The telemedicine survey response rate was 32%. Patient satisfaction with telehealth visits remained high with 98% of experiences across all domains rated as Good to Very Good. 90% of patients either preferred telehealth or expressed no preference with the in person vs. fully remote visits.
Conclusion
Treatment with fully remote providers is safe and feasible, with no serious patient events and minimal need for onsite care. We observed high patient satisfaction, consistent with our previously reported outcomes for telemedicine visits. These findings support the continuation of fully remote management for select patients in the post-COVID era, which can only continue if the current remote/telehealth exemption is continued beyond the emergency period.}

Yet, the science of coral restoration is still very focused on ecological and technical considerations, impeding the understanding of how coral restoration can be used to improve reef resilience in the context of socio-ecological systems. Here, we visited four well-established coral restoration projects in different regions of the world (Thailand, Maldives, Florida Keys, and US Virgin Islands), and conducted key-informant interviews to characterize local stakeholder's perceptions of the key benefits and limitations associated with restoration efforts. Our results reveal that perceptions around coral reef restoration encompass far more than ecological considerations, and include all four dimensions of sustainability: ecological, social, economic, and governance, suggesting that effective coral restoration should be guided by the principles of sustainability science. Socio-cultural benefits were the most frequently mentioned (72.4% of all respondents), while technical problems were the most common theme for limitations of coral restoration efforts (58.3% of the respondents). Participants also revealed some key points likely to improve the outcomes of coral restoration efforts such as the need to better embrace socio-cultural dimensions in goal setting, evaluate ecological outcomes more broadly, secure long-term funding and improve management and logistics of day to day practices. While we identify several important limitations of coral reef restoration, particularly around amateur workforces and limited involvement of local communities, our results suggest that coral restoration can be used as a powerful conservation education tool to provide hope, enhance agency, promote stewardship and strengthen coral reef conservation strategies.}

InSys, therefore, extends the idea of industrial ecology (IE) to the industrial sector by adopting a resource-efficient approach where one firm uses the unused or residual resources (materials, energy, water, assets, logistics, and expertise) of another firm. The aim is to enhance a sustainable and cleaner production in an environmentally friendly way, one in which generation of wastes and emission of greenhouse gases (including CO2) is minimized. Although previous literatures have investigated existing InSys tools, the utilization of the process integration (PI) tools for InSys design and planning has mostly operated in isolation of each other and thus concentrated on individual resources which makes the it hard for InSys designers to select the best tools. Furthermore, there is a dearth in research on comprehensive and integrated resource optimization, which considers the integration of all resources (such as energy, water, power, carbon and wastes) within InSys simultaneously. Therefore, this study investigated and surveyed available literatures in order to identify and develop a more comprehensive description of InSys tools, through the analysis of related methodologies and applications by integration of various resources optimization tools together for the design and establishment of EIPs. The tools are inclusive of both insight-based Pinch Analysis and mathematical optimization models approaches. The review also conducted a bibliometric analysis of some keywords using Scopus over a span of twenty-two years (1998–2019). Through the insights and understanding gained from the review, designers will be more equipped to make a more informed choice of working tools to utilize. Finally, suggestions were offered on some tools that will enhance the integration of eco-industrial parks to minimize fresh water/wastewater, minimize fuel use and reduce GHGs emissions and the minimization of cooling, heating and power requirements in Total Sites. The review of integrated resource optimization tools is then followed by identifying future research directions and development.}

Only a small proportion of patients with cancer enroll onto clinical trials. Previous studies have explored patient-related barriers to trial participation; however, few studies have focused on the provider perspective. We aimed to describe referral practices and barriers to referrals of patients with breast cancer for clinical trials, including the utilization of web-based trial-matching tools.
Materials and Methods
In 2016, we distributed 120 surveys to attendees of a breast oncology continuing medical education course. The survey addressed referral patterns, trial knowledge, and perceptions of web-based trial-matching tools. After survey completion, participants were provided a link to the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute trial-matching tool. Three months later, a follow-up survey was sent to assess their use of this tool. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize survey data.
Results
Ninety-six (80%) participants completed the first survey; 5 respondents did not actively treat patients with breast cancer and were excluded. Respondents included medical (30%) and surgical (22%) oncologists, nurse practitioners/physician assistants (26%), and other (22%). Neoadjuvant and metastatic trials were deemed the highest priority. The primary reported barriers included perceived lack of patient interest, lack of trial awareness, and logistical barriers. Emailing trial investigators directly was the preferred method of trial referral. Although 80% indicated that web-based tools would increase trial referrals, our follow-up survey revealed that only 18% of respondents used our web-based tool.
Conclusion
Our respondents valued trial participation for their patients but found it difficult to manage. Further research is needed regarding how to increase the likelihood that patients are presented with appropriate trial options.}

abstract = {Background
A majority of surgical patients are prescribed opioids for pain management. Many patients have pre-existing chronic pain managed with opioids and/or opioid use disorders (OUDs), which can complicate perioperative management. Patients who use opioids prior to surgery are at increased risk of developing OUD after surgery. To date, no studies have examined the prevalence of opioid screening and electronic medical record (EMR) documentation prior to surgery.
Materials and methods
A 40-item survey was administered to 268 patients at their first postoperative care visit at a single tertiary academic center from October 2017 to July 2018. A chart review of a random sample of 100 patients was performed to determine provider opioid screening prevalence in the presurgical setting. Log-binomial models were used to calculate prevalence ratios (PRs) to determine the provider role (surgeon, advanced practice clinicians [APC], surgical trainee) association with opioid screening documentation. Exploratory qualitative interviews were conducted with surgical providers to identify barriers to screening and screening documentation.
Results
Only 7% of patients were screened preoperatively for opioid use. A total of 38% of patients self-reported that they had used opioids in the past year. Of that group, only 3% had screening by a surgical provider prior to surgery documented in their EMR. Provider role was not associated with likelihood of opioid screening (surgeon versus trainee, PR = 1.2, 95% CI 0.2-8.5) (surgeons versus APCs, PR = 1.05, 95% CI 0.17-8.53). EMRs were discordant with patient survey results for patients with no ICD-10 codes for opioid use. The most common perceived barriers to preoperative screening were insufficient clinic time; logistics of who should screen/not required as part of their clinical workflow; not perceiving screening as a priority; and lack of expertise in the area of chronic opioid use and OUD.
Conclusions
Preoperative screening for opioid use is uncommon, and EMRs are often discordant with patient self-reported use. Efforts to increase preoperative screening will need to address barriers screening practices and increasing health system support by incorporating screening into the clinical workflow and adding it to documentation templates.}

The authors found that early outcomes of real-world patients receiving axi-cel therapy were comparable to those observed in the clinical trial population, despite >40% of these patients failing to meet the clinical trial eligibility criteria. At a live meeting in February 2019, we sought the perceptions of community hematologists and oncologists (H/O) regarding their use of, referrals for and barriers to CAR-T therapy as well their perception of the value of the real-world evidence (RWE) presented. Methods A live meeting in February 2019 convened H/O with geographic representation from across the United States. The participants were shown data from selected oral and/or poster presentations from the 2018 ASH Annual Meeting and responded to questions regarding their perceptions of the data and its potential impact on current practice. Participants submitted their demographic responses via a web-based survey prior to the meeting and data impression responses via an audience response system at the live meeting. Results Among the 59 H/O who participated in this live market research program on February 22-23, 2019, 61% identified their primary specialty as hematology/oncology and 34% medical oncology. Only 27% of H/O had attended the 60th ASH Annual Meeting in December 2018. The participants were mostly community-based physicians, 50% in private community and 45% in community practices owned by a hospital or academic center. One-third have been in practice for over 20 years, one-third for 11-20 years and one-third for 10 or fewer years. This group sees an average of 20+ patients per day and reported B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma as one of the three most common hematologic malignancy they managed. 28% of H/O indicated that they have referred one patient and 24% have referred 2-5 patients for CAR-T therapy since the first approval on August 30, 2017. Of those H/O who had referred patients for CAR-T therapy, 45% indicated that none of their patients had yet received the infusion. The top two barriers to prescribing/recommending CAR-T therapy, as reported by the H/O, were the cumbersome logistics of administering therapy and following patients (52%), and the cost of the therapy (46%). Other concerns included high toxicity (24%) and lack of long-term survival data (19%), but not lack of knowledge of CAR-T therapy (2%). Furthermore, 87% of H/O agreed with the assertion that due to the limitations of randomized clinical trials, RWE is necessary to inform clinical practice. After review of the information presented on the real-world use of axi-cel, 73% of H/O indicated that this information is likely to cause them to recommend CAR-T therapy for more of their patients with DLBCL. Conclusions There is significant interest in adopting and using CAR-T therapies in LBCL amongst community H/O. This group does not perceive itself as lacking in knowledge regarding CAR-T therapy. The significant barriers of logistics and cost are potential deterrents to appropriate use. These results can inform stakeholders (manufacturers, payers, hospitals and practices) regarding the need to improve processes and develop payment models to address cost in order to facilitate access of these agents to the appropriate patients. RWE is viewed favorably by the vast majority of community H/O to inform clinical practice, due to the limitations of randomized clinical trials.

abstract = {Background
Accurate determination of probable surgical outcomes is fundamental in decision-making regarding appropriate abdominal aortic aneurysm treatment. These outcomes depend, among other factors, on patient-related factors such as physical fitness. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation between physical fitness, measured by the metabolic equivalent of task (MET) score and the five-factor Modified Frailty Index (MFI-5), and all-cause mortality.
Methods
Four hundred twenty-nine patients undergoing elective endovascular treatment of an infrarenal aortic aneurysm (EVAR) from January 2011 to September 2018 were identified in an existing local abdominal aortic aneurysm database. Physical fitness was measured by the MFI-5 and the METs as registered during preoperative screening. The primary end point was 1-year all-cause mortality and secondary end points included 5-year all-cause mortality, freedom from aneurysm-related mortality and aneurysm-related reinterventions. Correlations were analyzed using Spearman's rho and survival was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier analyses. The effect of physical fitness on mortality was assessed by binary logistics regression analyses.
Results
There was a positive correlation between the MFI-5 and 1-year all-cause mortality (Rho = 0.163; P = .001), but not between the METs and 1-year all-cause mortality (Rho = –0.083; P = .124). A significant correlation between both MFI-5 and METs and 5-year all-cause mortality was observed (Rho = 0.255; P < .001 and Rho = –0.154; P = .004). When stratified by the MFI-5, the 1- and 5-year follow-up survival rates were 95.1% and 85.9%, respectively, in the group with the lowest MFI-5 and 74.5% and 33.1% in the group with the highest MFI-5 score (P = .007 and P < .001). When stratified by METs categories for 1-year follow-up, no significant differences in survival between the groups were observed (P = .090). The 5-year follow-up survival rate was 39.4% in the lowest METs category and 76.3% in the highest METs category (P = .039). Logistic regression analysis, assessing the impact of age, sex, METs, and the MFI-5 on the risk of all-cause mortality, showed that only age and the MFI-5 made a significant contribution.
Conclusions
There is a significant positive association between the MFI-5 and both the 1- and 5-year all-cause mortality rates after EVAR; METs only correlated with the 5-year all-cause mortality. Only age and the MFI-5 contributed to predicting overall survival after EVAR; therefore, it could be recommended to add the MFI-5 for guidance in preoperative counselling.}

Unfortunately, it coincided with the major shrimp farming season in India which contributes 60% of the national annual shrimp production hence the impact was substantial. An on-line survey was carried out among the stakeholders of the shrimp farming sector to evaluate the prospective impact of COVID-19 related lockdown across the shrimp supply chain. The study estimated an economic loss of 1.50 billion USD to the shrimp aquaculture sector during the current year. It is expected that shrimp production and its export performance may be declining by 40% in the current season. The Garret ranking and Rank Based Quotient analyses projected severe constraints in shrimp seed production and supply, disruptions in the supply chain, logistics, farming, processing, marketing and loss of employment and income for the workers due to the pandemic. To mitigate the impact, the Government of India declared fisheries and aquaculture as an essential activity, facilitated the movement of inputs and services. Further, a major Fisheries Development Scheme(PMMSY) with a financial outlay of 267 million USD has been announced to usher in a blue revolution by strengthening the value chain, doubling the fisher/farmer income, employment generation, economic and social security for fishers/fish farmers adhering to the sustainability principles. Short and medium-term technical and policy measures are suggested to tide over the impact of COVID-19 related lockdown and related restrictions.}

abstract = {Delineating the stock structure of highly-mobile, wide-ranging fishes subject to exploitation is a challenging task, yet one that is fundamental to optimal fisheries management. A case in point are stocks of skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis), yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares), bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) and albacore tuna (Thunnus alalunga) in the Pacific Ocean, which support important commercial, artisanal, subsistence, and recreational fisheries, and contribute roughly 70 % of global commercial tuna catches. Although some spatial and temporal structuring is recognised within these stocks, growing evidence from a range of approaches suggests that the stock structure of each tuna species is more complex than is currently assumed in both stock assessment and climate change models, and in management regimes. In a move towards improving understanding of the stock structure of skipjack, yellowfin, bigeye and South Pacific albacore tunas in the Pacific Ocean, an international workshop was held in Nouméa, New Caledonia, in October 2018 to review knowledge about their movement and stock structure in the region, define and discuss the main knowledge gaps and uncertainties concerning their stock structure, and develop biological sampling approaches to support the provision of this information. Here, we synthesise the discussions of this latter component. For each tuna species, we identify several general sampling considerations needed to reduce uncertainty, including i) the need for broadscale sampling in space, ideally covering each species’ distribution, targeting adults in spawning condition and adopting a phased approach; ii) the need for temporally-repeated sampling of the same geographical areas to assess stability in observed patterns over time; iii) the need to resolve patterns in spatial dynamics, such as those resulting from movements associated with the seasonal extensions of poleward flowing currents, from underlying stock structure, iv) the importance of adopting a multidisciplinary approach to stock identification, and v) the need for careful planning of logistics and coordination of sampling efforts across agencies. Finally, we present potential sampling designs that could be adopted to help overcome uncertainties around the initial identification of stocks and the provenance, mixing and proportional contributions of individuals in harvested assemblages, as well as how these uncertainties could be accounted for in fisheries management via the use of management strategy evaluation.}

abstract = {Objectives
This is the first report of a successful skin grafting between monozygotic twins in the United Kingdom (UK). We discuss the process of assessing the suitability of the patients for the procedure, gaining approval and extraordinary funding from the relevant bodies, developing a new protocol within the trust and the logistics of carrying out the procedure safely.
Methods
We describe the case of a 61-year-old paraplegic woman with insensate legs who presented with a 5-week old 2% TBSA deep dermal to full-thickness scald burn which was sustained accidentally in the shower. In view of the prolonged healing time and the risk of burn wound infection, skin grafting of the wound was the recommended treatment. However, given the high risk of impaired wound healing in denervated skin of quadriplegic individuals, the patient was warned of potential donor site wound healing problems. This, along with concerns over the donor site area interfering with the use of her mobility aids prompted her homozygotic twin sister to donate the necessary skin. The process was risk assessed and approval was sought from the Trust's Caldicott Guardian, NHS Specialist Commissioners and the Trust's Human Tissue Authority (HTA) Designated Individual (DI). A new protocol for the pathway in line with HTA guidance was developed. Specific patient information documents were written, psychological assessments performed and specific consent for skin donation undertaken. One week prior to and again on the day of the procedure, the donor was serologically screened for communicable diseases. A donor medical and social history assessment was also carried out.
Results
There was 100% graft take at day 5 post-surgery. The sister's donor site healed well by day 13. At 3 months, there were no signs of hypertrophic scarring. No additional outpatient or dressing clinic appointment were required.
Discussion
This is the first case of successful skin homografting between monozygotic twins in the United Kingdom. Donation of skin grafts between such patients, however, requires clinical justification, twin zygosity DNA testing, approval from the HTA and NHS commissioners with appropriate protocols and procedures in place to ensure patient safety. Liaising with the local Tissue Bank can facilitate this process.
Conclusion
Skin grafting between identical twins is a feasible and successful procedure and offers an alternative treatment modality when wound healing in the recipient twin is suboptimal or when severely burnt. This principle should also be considered, in appropriate cases, for composite tissue transfer in situations where complex reconstructions are required.}

Yet the majority of road networks in Ghana and other countries in Sub-Sahara Africa are not geographically referenced, to facilitate their uses for road maintenance and management, transport planning, emergency services, disaster cases, logistics, tourism and other location based services. Consequently, this study takes advantage of paratransit service and the location of landmarks to provide location addressing of road networks in Ghana. The paratransit service, popularly known as Trotro in Ghana is a local transit system that uses an automobile to move people and goods along a prescribed travel route on a road network, with locally known stops where people get on and off the vehicle. The Trotro service is popular in Ghana, yet there is no critical investigation demonstrating its spatial coverage, relevance as a credible location addressing for road networks, or as a comprehensive location data for location based services. This study provides evidence for this case, and investigates the spatial coverage of road networks used by the Trotro vehicles, and the mapping of their service stops together with landmarks in the Asokore Mampong Municipality (AMM) of Ashanti region in Ghana. It was found that the location data from both Trotro service and landmarks covered about 86% of the entire road network in AMM; providing a large coverage of the road network and greater geographic detail. A service area estimation undertaken using the generated location data shows a high geographic accessibility, with travel distances as low as 160 m from any location to the nearest Trotro service or landmark covering about 80% of the road networks. These results show the capability of the generated location data to tackle the problem of spatially unreferenced road networks, and to significantly improve their effective uses. The popularity of paratransit in Sub-Sahara Africa means that this study can be adapted to other countries where the majority of the road networks are not spatially referenced.}

abstract = {The control of the environmental impacts is a considerable challenge to the daily operations of modern logistics companies, especially under the current trend of increasing carbon dioxide emission. This paper focusses on freight distribution, introduces a transportation resource sharing strategy to address the multi-depot green vehicle routing problem, and incorporates the time-dependency of speed as well as piecewise penalty costs for earliness and tardiness of deliveries. Transportation resource sharing is proposed to eliminate long and empty-vehicle trips, improve the network's fluidity and the efficiency of resource management. A bi-objective model is proposed to minimize total carbon emission and operating cost, while enforcing piecewise penalty costs on earliness and tardiness to reduce waiting time and improve customer satisfaction. Further, we combine the Clarke and Wright Savings Heuristic Algorithm (CWSHA), the Sweep Algorithm (SwA) and the Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (MOPSO) to design a hybrid heuristic algorithm for the vehicle routing optimization. CWSHA and SwA are consecutively used to generate the initial population, and MOPSO is employed for local and global solution search. Computational experiments reveal that sharing transportation resource reduces the total travelled distance, the number of vehicles, and facilitates a cost effective and environment-friendly distribution network. In addition, we also observe that the shortest path sometimes undermines minimum cost and carbon emission objectives. Moreover, sensitivity analyses reveal that vehicle routes are less influenced by piecewise penalty costs under unimodal traffic flows, while bimodal traffic flows would require more investment to reduce carbon emission.}

It was determined the physical and physical-chemical quality of soybean grains before and after drying and during the time in storage. The best option of preprocessing and storage strategy to obtain soybean flow and quality in high-capacity storage and handling unit was the combined drying (SSS1, SSS2, SSS3) and dry-aeration storage systems. The soybean grains harvested at high water contents submitted to drying at low temperatures and stored under artificially refrigerated conditions presented better grain quality over storage time but increased the operational drying time, hindering the flow of grain mass.}

abstract = {Objectives
Clinical trials are pillars of modern clinical evidence generation. However, the clinical trial enterprise can be inefficient, and trials often fail before their planned endpoint is reached. We sought to estimate how often urologic oncology trials fail, why trials fail, and associations with trial failure.
Methods
We queried phase 2/3 urologic clinical trial data from ClinicalTrials.gov registered between 2007 and 2019, with status marked as active, completed, or terminated. We extracted relevant trial data, including anticipated and actual accrual, from trial records and ClinicalTrials.gov archives. We manually coded reasons given in the “why stopped” free text field for trial failure into categories (poor accrual, interim results, toxicity/adverse events, study agent unavailable, canceled by the sponsor, inadequate budget, logistics, trial no longer needed, principal investigator left, no reason given, or other). We considered trials terminated for safety or efficacy to be completed trials. Trials marked as terminated for other reasons were considered failed trials. We then estimated the rate of trial failure using competing risks methods. Finally, we assessed associations with trial failure using a Cox proportional hazards model.
Results
A total of 1,869 urologic oncology trials were included. Of these, 225 (12.0%) failed, and 51 (2.7%) were terminated for “good” reasons (e.g., toxicity, efficacy). Of the 225 failed trials, 122 (54%) failed due to poor accrual. Failed trials had a lower anticipated accrual than successfully completed trials (55 vs. 63 patients, P<0.001). A total of 6,832 patients were actually accrued to failed trials. The 10-year estimated risk of trial failure was 17% (95% CI 15%–22%). Single center trials, phase 3 trials, drug trials, and trials with exclusively USA sites were more likely to fail.
Conclusion
We estimate that 17%, or roughly 1 in 6, of urologic oncology trials fail, most frequently for poor accrual. Further investigations are needed into systemic, trial, and site-specific factors that may impact accrual and successful trial completion.}

abstract = {Introduction
Informed consent for ionising radiation medical imaging examinations represents a recent change to medical imaging practice. This practice has not had a definitive and authoritative integration into clinical practice, and lack of direction has caused many health care professionals to be unsure of an appropriate consent methodology. Consent practices have been undertaken inconsistently and sometimes poorly. This research sought to investigate what barriers exist to meaningful informed consent, and what pathways are suggested to overcome these barriers. These views are then discussed in the context of practical health care consent practices.
Methods
A semi-structured interview explored the views of radiographers and radiologists on the practice of disclosing the ionising radiation risk of a clinical medical imaging examination. Qualitative data was analysed using a nominal method of quantitative transformation. Responses were reviewed, and a set of definitive themes constructed. Participants considered the influences, logistics and barriers to the informed consent process. Participants were then asked what pathways might be developed that would improve the process.
Results
Twenty-one (21) radiographer participants and nine (9) radiologists were interviewed. The barriers to consent identified issues of time constraints, lack of a unified message, and patient presentations. Pathways suggested included limiting the scope of the consent practice, sharing the consent responsibility, and formulation of definitive consent guidelines.
Conclusion
A unified, definitive series of guidelines for informed consent for ionising radiation examinations would alleviate many of the identified barriers. Having the consent process consistently begin with the referring doctor would facilitate more meaningful consent.}

abstract = {Context
Resilience represents the ability of systems to anticipate, withstand, or adapt to challenges. Times of great stress and disturbance offer opportunity to identify and confirm key contributors to agri-food system resilience. The COVID-19 pandemic and its related consequences constituted major shock, challenging the resilience of many agri-food systems worldwide.
Objective
This paper aimed to report the immediate effects of the COVID-19 crisis on various key actors from Flemish food supply chains. By analysing and assessing the observed impacts of and reactions to this crisis from a resilience perspective, it also aimed to gain empirical evidence on resilience-enhancing characteristics of agri-food systems to sudden shocks.
Methods
A first, quantitative step of our mixed method approach measured 718 farmers' experienced impacts and applied strategies following the crisis through an online survey. A second, qualitative step captured impacts and responses from other key actors downstream the food supply chain through 22 in-depth interviews and 18 on-line questionnaires. Data gathering and interpretation followed a conceptual framework for analysing resilience of agri-food systems to external challenges, that we developed based on the literature. The framework states that resilience actions stem from three types of resilience capacities: anticipatory, coping and responsive capacities. These are determined by both resources allocated by system actors, as well as by resilience attributes from the system.
Results and conclusions
The COVID-19 crisis induced a simultaneous dropped demand for food products in the hospitality industry and risen demand in retail. This shifted demand significantly disturbed food production, processing and marketing processes in terms of labour organization, planning, operation, logistics, and economic returns. Perceived impacts varied extensively across actors from the agri-food system, mostly depending on their marketing strategy, customer base, and flexibility and diversity of their practices. Reported reactions to this crisis revealed that resilience capacities varied according to actors' abilities to negotiate prices, adjust production processes, and maintain or reorient sales. Some agri-food sectors showed higher responsive capacity because of a higher connectivity and self-organization within the system.
Significance
Our findings suggest that flexibility and diversity, despite their tendency to diminish price optimums, increase resilience capacities, which may be more beneficial to systems for thriving in turbulent and uncertain environments. A more tangible, operationalized understanding of resilience is necessary to effectively improve agri-food system resilience. Our conceptual framework proved a valuable tool for operationalizing resilience assessments to major shocks.}
