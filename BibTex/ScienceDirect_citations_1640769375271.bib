abstract = {Multi-commodity flow problems (MCFs) can be found in many areas, such as transportation, communication, and logistics. Therefore, such problems have been studied by a multitude of researchers, and a variety of methods have been proposed for solving it. However, most researchers only discuss the properties of different models and algorithms without taking into account the impacts of actual implementation. In fact, the true performance of a method may differ greatly across various implementations. In this paper, several popular optimization solvers for implementations of column generation and Lagrangian relaxation are discussed. In order to test scalability and optimality, three groups of networks with different structures are used as case studies. Results show that column generation outperforms Lagrangian relaxation in most instances, but the latter is better suited to networks with a large number of commodities.}

abstract = {The Mackenzie River is a major transportation route serving many remote northern Canadian communities and mining sites. The river is only navigable during the summer and early fall, when clear of ice. However, the river’s water conditions have changed significantly in recent years, and are expected to continue to do so, resulting in increased uncertainty for waterway transport. This paper presents a model for providing guidance to shipping companies, customers, and government on how shipping patterns may need to evolve to effectively adapt to changing climate conditions. Future freight volumes are forecasted using time series analysis. Then, logistics cost optimization is used to incorporate predicted water flow profile changes in shipping companies’ future delivery schedule planning. Results indicate that future waterway freight delivery capacities in September and October may be insufficient to transport forecasted volumes, and shipping companies may be advised to arrange for increased delivery activities in June and July. If delivery capacities are constrained by equipment and crew availability rather than water conditions in the first half of the shipping season, shipping companies may also need to take advantage of earlier anticipated ice breakup to begin the delivery season earlier. Incorporating this method for climate change adaptation in freight schedule planning may aid both shipping companies and government agencies in rethinking current practices. The method is particularly suitable for a region where harsh environmental conditions, climate change, and extreme remoteness have an overwhelming impact on operations, and logistical delays are considered quite differently from supply chains further south.}

The produce-to-stock with production disruptions model is applicable to systems where the decision on production rate is coupled with the setting of the base stock level when production disruptions are possible.

This paper studies the transfer feasibility for elderly passengers passing through specific barriers at high-speed train stations. Questionnaires were distributed at Beijing High-Speed Train Station, with 716 valid samples involved. This paper divides the transfer procedure into seven phases, and proposes various points of interest at each phase with different barriers. These points of barriers are categorized into three major different types: Serious AND Common, Serious BUT NOT Common, and Common BUT NOT Serious. The quantitative relationships between each point of barriers and old travelers’ information have been explored using decision tree and binary logistics regression. As a conclusion, we suggest some recommendations for improving the transfer environment, long-distance mobility, as well as wellbeing of the older adults at high-speed train stations. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study the transfer feasibility at high speed train stations for seniors both qualitatively and quantitatively, especially dealing with the complicated transfer procedure.}

Lines are simulated with different values of line length, mean buffer storage capacity and configuration of uneven buffer allocation. The best patterns in terms of generating higher throughput and lower average buffer level as compared to a balanced merging line are those where total available buffer capacity is allocated as evenly as possible between workstations and to concentrate more buffer capacity towards the end of the line, respectively.}

The different approaches to administration vary in their convenience, both to staff and patients, which can translate to differences in prescription compliance. Furthermore, the choice of technique can reduce the amount of drug administered, thereby improving the side effect profile. All opiates, regardless of the technique employed, require meticulous and careful titration based upon sound understanding. Training of staff and education of patients regarding the logistics of the chosen route is important to ensure optimal opiate delivery and detection of undesirable adverse events. Abuse and diversion of opiates warrants judicious administration and prescription considerations.}

This chapter covers the fourth area of technological and market development that was necessary for print-on-demand to impact the academic book which was book fulfilment, i.e. the physical book supply chain. This includes all aspects of book fulfilment to enable sales through all possible retail channels. Four critical elements of the book supply chain that needed to be in place to make scaled-up print-on-demand sales happen: electronic data interchange (EDI) of orders for books including shipping messages; effective book metadata describing each individual book in defined industry standards which one computer can pass to another; encoded metadata information into barcodes to speed-up handling processes for thousands of unique books; and supply chain innovations in the wider business ecosystems which made small parcel logistics cost effective for customers. The chapter concludes with two interviews and an extended case study. The first interview was conducted in 2016 with John Ingram, Owner, Ingram Content Group/Lightning Source Inc. USA where he recounts the origins of the first Lightning Print service, the establishment of Lighting Source Inc. and reflects on the author services publishing phenomena that print-on-demand enabled. The second interview was conducted in 2017 with Edwin Ng, CEO, Markono Singapore and he reflects on the origins of book print-on-demand in Singapore and the increasing importance of logistics, warehousing and distribution services offered by printers. Finally the extended case study is an extract from a PhD thesis dating from 2009.

In its recent report on enhancing defense system reliability, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences has recently discredited these methods, judging the Military Handbook (MIL-HDBK-217) and its progeny as invalid and inaccurate. This paper discusses the issues that arise with the use of handbook-based methods in commercial and military avionics applications.

The multi-trip location routing problem is an integrated problem that combines two important and difficult optimization problems: the facility location problem and the multi-trip vehicle routing problem. In the facility location problem, one has to determine the set of facilities that can be used to serve the clients. To fulfill the clients needs, we generate a set of routes by solving a multi-trip vehicle routing problem which allows the assignment of more than one single-trip to a vehicle along the planning horizon. To solve the multi-trip location routing problem, we propose a column generation approach that integrates these two problems. In practice, both the facility location problem and the multi-trip vehicle routing problem are solved simultaneously. This approach leads to better solutions than those achieved by solving the two problems separately. Computational results are described at the end of the paper to illustrate the potential of this approach.}

Enhanced mechanisms of credit risk analysis are needed to safeguard banks and the flow of goods in supply chains. Little emphasis has been given to the contextual examination of such factors, either in terms of market conditions or the particular characteristics of different industries. This paper investigates the varying importance of a number of factors connected with the performance of corporate bank loans during times of financial turbulence in the shipping industry. Little extant literature exists on default risk drivers for loans made to shipping companies for new build vessels or second-hand ship purchases. A binary logit model is used to examine the criteria for assessing the security of shipping loans issued by banks. Thirty shipping loans made during the period 2005–2009 are examined. Results suggest that financial factors, non-financial factors, shipowners׳ experience, and employability and market risk indicators are the best criteria for evaluating the performance of shipping loans during turbulent market conditions and periods when financing options are restricted. The paper makes a specific contribution to the literature on risk management with regard to credit risk analysis by highlighting shipping specific factors and their importance for risk measurement. The results are of interest to banks seeking to accurately assess the credibility of shipping loans; shipowners, who can identify credit risk factors on which to focus; and supply chain participants where unfulfilled bank financing can cause disruptions to their logistics operations.}

The era of modern stabilized military foods began with the advent of aseptic canning technology and evolved through the greater use of hermetically sealed food supply systems in WW1. Contemporary concepts of 24-h combat ration packs were instituted in WW2 to sustain soldiers going in to battle until field kitchens could be set up. Military logistics supply systems require rations to be stable for up to 3 years under non-refrigerated and potentially hot conditions. Solutions in food processing, chemistry and packaging have been developed to maintain the nutritive and vitamin content of the rations as well as the organoleptic acceptability.}

Early clinical and logistics decision making can often have important effects on subsequent outcomes. There are lessons to be learned from out-of-hospital care, military medicine, humanitarian medicine, and disaster medicine that can inform in-hospital medicine, and vice-versa. The future of extreme, expedition, and wilderness medicine will be defined by both recipients and practitioners, and empirical observations will be transformed by evidence-based practice.}

abstract = {The T-Ten European program aims at optimizing the transport logistics in Europe by promoting alternative transport modes. Navigation transport offers a competitive and environmentally friendly alternative. Hence, it is foresaw an increase of the navigation transport demand that it will be necessary to accommodate. This will be very challenging particularly in a global change context where less available water resource is expected. A constraint satisfaction problem based on flow graph is proposed in this paper to study the resilience of inland navigation networks against increase of the navigation demand and extreme events. Drought and flood scenarios are simulated considering an network composed of five interconnected navigation reaches. The results show that the designed tools are well adapted to the resilience study of inland navigation networks.}

By using the economic order quantity model, we can define the optimal order quantity, along which our stock management can be guaranteed by the most favourable cost level. The theoretical approach of the model assumes a deterministic operational environment. In practice, however, there are several unpredictable factors influencing the operation of the production company. The aim of our analyses is to present the relations between the stock level and the risk of shortages. As a result of the research, the introduction of the safety stock is the solution to cover the effects of the uncertain factors in the supply chain. The avoidance of stock shortages would be possible only with the management of an infinite stock level due to the stochastic factors, but it is not feasible in practice. We need to quantify a service level, which determines the accepted probability of the shortage occurrence.}

An extensive computational study is conducted on rich and diverse problem instances. The results highlight the competitiveness of BRILS in terms of quality and time, where it provides high-quality solutions within reasonable computational times. In the context of real-world environments, the performance exhibited by BRILS motivates its incorporation in intelligent and integrative systems where frequent and fast solutions are required.}

In this study, we investigate the WEEE management system as a socio-technical system. Through interviews with 23 stakeholders, we identify conflicts of interest and technological, organisational and institutional constraints for integrating preparation for reuse as a management option within the current system. Based on this, we identify four main prerequisites for a future integration of preparation for reuse. These are: a) extended tendering periods to incentivise technological investments; b) the introduction of measures to incentivise municipal waste authorities to organise value-conserving logistics; c) the introduction of standards and/or guidelines to ensure the quality and safety of preparation operations and data management; and d) measures to avoid transboundary sales of used EEE. Based on transition management theory, we suggest pilot testing and the development of niche projects to test new constellations of collaboration between actors in the system.}

Differing from the long-term strategic problems (e.g., the two-echelon vehicle routing problem (2E-VRP), the two-echelon location routing problem (2E-LRP) and the truck and trailer routing problem (TTRP)) that make location decisions in depots or satellites, the paper introduces a short-term tactical problem named the two-echelon time-constrained vehicle routing problem in linehaul-delivery systems (2E-TVRP) considering carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The linehaul level and the delivery level are linked through city distribution centers (CDCs). The 2E-TVRP, which takes CO2 emissions per ton-kilometer as the objective, has inter-CDC linehaul on the 1st level and delivery from CDCs to satellites on the 2nd level. The Clarke and Wright savings heuristic algorithm (CW) improved by a local search phase is put forward. The case study shows the applicability of the model to real-life problems. The results suggest that the vehicle scheduling provided by the 2E-TVRP is promising to reduce the CO2 emissions per ton-kilometer of the linehaul-delivery system. Adjusting the central depot location or developing the loaded-semitrailer demand among O-D pairs to eliminate empty-running of tractors will contribute to reduce the CO2 emission factor.}

It is possible to drive and monitor these KPIs by looking at both the state of the warehouse components and the operations carried out by them. Therefore, it is necessary to represent this knowledge in an explicit and formally-specified data model and provide automated methods to derive the KPIs from the representation. In this paper, we implement a minimalistic data model for a subset of warehouse resources using linked data in order to monitor a few KPIs, namely sustainability, safety and performance. The applicability of the approach and the data model is illustrated through a use case. We demonstrate that it is possible to develop minimalistic data models through Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration (OSLC) resource shapes which enables compatibility with the declarative and procedural knowledge of automated warehouse agents specified in Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL).}

Given the need for longer-term monitoring, several autonomous ice-tethered observational platforms have been developed and deployed in the Arctic since the last decade. This review outlines their abilities, conception, and limitations. Most platforms were developed to measure physical data, which highlights a critical need for ice-tethered observatories monitoring biological processes.}

In this paper, we consider a production planning problem arising in the context of reverse logistics, namely the economic lot-sizing with remanufacturing (ELSR). In the ELSR, deterministic demand for a single item over a finite time horizon has to be satisfied, which can be performed from either newly produced or remanufactured items, and the goal consists in minimizing the total production costs. Our objective is to devise approaches to solve larger (more difficult) instances of the problem available in the literature to optimality using a standard mixed-integer programming (MIP) solver. We present a multicommodity extended formulation and a strengthened Wagner–Whitin based formulation, which makes use of a priori addition of newly described valid inequalities in the space of original variables. We also propose a novel dynamic heuristic measure based on the cost structure to automatically determine the size of a partial version of the Wagner–Whitin based formulation. Computational results show that the novel partial Wagner–Whitin based formulation with the size automatically determined in a heuristic way outperforms all the other tested approaches, including a best performing shortest path formulation available in the literature, when we consider the number of instances solved to proven optimality using a standard MIP solver. This new approach allowed to solve to optimality more than 96% of the tested instances for the ELSR with separate setups, including several instances that could not be solved otherwise.}

Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is believed to be the next generation technology for tracking and data-collection and has successfully been applied in several industries such as manufacturing, retail and logistics. RFID technology is also seen as the next disruptive innovation in healthcare and represents several opportunities for increased safety, operational efficiency and cost savings, by tagging inventory, assets, patients and personnel. Even though RFID promises several benefits for the healthcare industry, the adoption of RFID technology in the health sector has not been as striking as anticipated and still lags behind compared to other industries. Through a literature review, this paper attempts to explore the challenges of RFID adoption in healthcare, with a focus on patient safety. Our main findings suggest that high costs of adoption, concerns related to security and privacy, and human safety risks are the main barriers for adoption.}

abstract = {Science communication is becoming ever more prevalent, with more and more scientists expected to not only communicate their research to a wider public, but to do so in an innovative and engaging manner. Given the other commitments that researchers and academics are required to fulfil as part of their workload models, it is unfair to be expect them to also instantly produce effective science communication events and activities. However, by thinking carefully about what it is that needs to be communicated, and why this is being done, it is possible to develop high-quality activities that are of benefit to both the audience and the communicator(s). In this paper, I present some practical advice for developing, delivering and evaluating effective science communication initiatives, based on over a decade of experience as being a professional science communicator. I provide advice regarding event logistics, suggestions on how to successfully market and advertise your science communication initiatives, and recommendations for establishing effective branding and legacy.}

abstract = {The development, in the last decades, of technologies for precision agriculture allows the acquisition of crop data with a high spatial resolution. This offers possibilities for innovative control and raises new logistics issues that may be solved using discrete event models. In vineyards, some technologies make it possible to define zones with different qualities of grapes and sort the grapes at harvest to make different vintages. In this context, the Differential Harvest Problem (DHP) consists in finding a trajectory of the harvesting machine in the field in order to obtain at least a given quantity of higher quality grapes and minimising working time. In available literature, the DHP has been solved using Constraint Programming. In this paper, we investigate if it is possible to solve the DHP using the Cost Optimal Reachability Analysis feature of a model-checking tool such as UppAal-CORA. A model named DHP PTA has been designed based on the priced timed automata formalism and the UppAal-CORA tool. The method made it possible to obtain the optimal trajectory of a harvesting machine for a vine plot composed of up to 12 rows. The study is based on real vineyard data.}

However, due to the mobility of objects and various kinds of RFID collisions, a proper planning of RFID readers is needed. Existing RFID reader planning approaches are designed for stationary scenarios and hence cannot have desirable performance when handling mobile objects. In this paper, we investigate the RFID reader planning problem for the surveillance of mobile objects whose motion can be predicted. We define the evaluation metric for the reader planning by dividing the surveillance time into multiple time slots and compute the successful identification of tags in individual time slot respectively. We further propose several reader planning strategies to handle RFID collisions in the surveillance. Genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization are used to get the optimal result based on the evaluation metric and the reader planning strategies. We perform extensive simulations for validating the proposed approaches. The results show that our approach can achieve a good accuracy in the surveillance.}

For this purpose production systems are modeled as complex networks, in which nodes represent machines and edges represent the material flow between them. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed method taking a machine tool manufacturer with a job shop manufacturing as a research example.}

Due to this duality in role, ports are considered inseparable from the city's overall management, leading to port management by general local administration. Increasing competition with ports of East Asian counties, however, has compelled the national government to press major ports to make their terminals more efficient and competitive. Under the latest national port policy, Kobe and Osaka joined forces to form up the first strategic port alliance in the country. They established a joint port company in 2014 to manage their terminals in an integrated way. This paper investigates the Kobe-Osaka port alliance to assess how it works in reality and also discusses challenges and business opportunities. It is based on intensive interviews together with an overview of the historical evolution of Japan's container port policy and also a comparative analysis with recent cases of port alliance around the world. For Kobe and Osaka, in order to make the most of the synergy of this alliance, strengthening the autonomy of the port company and implementing a range of logistics strategies are important issues.}

Promotion of inland ports is a cross-cutting theme, since supply chain sustainability initiatives tend to involve customers—and alter the traditional cost/service trade-off in logistics.}

In order to improve their operational cost efficiency, companies have adopt lean principles in all their manufacturing activities, in particular, just-in-time supply chain. However, a consequence of this policy makes the transportation network from the local supply chain time critical. This paper uses an enterprise system model integrated with a quantitative method to study a manufacturing company’s logistics system re-development project. The quantitative risk analysis examines the project’s systems engineering management plan to see if it is sufficiently to mitigate risks in design, monitoring and validation of the project’s lifecycle processes. The computed risk profile shows a trend of decreasing risk and suggests areas of improvement in the systems engineering plan to ensure greater probability of success. The research assumes a single risk profile for the supply chain. Research is continuing in expanding to more accurate risk profile of the project when partners of the supply chain have individual profiles.}

In this paper, we propose an effective large-scale mobile crowd-tasking model in which a large pool of citizen workers are used to perform the last-mile delivery. To efficiently solve the model, we formulate it as a network min-cost flow problem and propose various pruning techniques that can dramatically reduce the network size. Comprehensive experiments were conducted with Singapore and Beijing datasets. The results show that our solution can support real-time delivery optimization in the large-scale mobile crowd-sourcing problem.}

Traders play a key role in the trade network, as they are logistics hubs and responsible for large animal movements. In order to implement targeted control measures in case of a disease outbreak, it is hence strongly advisable to use information about the holding type in the pig production chain. However, in many datasets the types of the producing farms or the fact whether the agent is a trader are unknown. In this paper we introduce two indices that can be used to identify the position of a producing farm in the pig production chain and more importantly, identify traders. This was realized partially through a novel dynamic programming algorithm. Analyzing the pig trade network in Germany from 2005 to 2007, we demonstrate that our algorithm is very sensitive in detecting traders. Since the methodology can easily be applied to trade networks in other countries with similar infrastructure and legislation, we anticipate its use for augmenting the datasets in further network analyses and targeting control measures. For further usage, we have developed an R package which can be found in the supplementary material to this manuscript.}

Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have a fundamental role in transforming a metropolitan area into a smart city. In the past two decades, many applications of ITS, e.g. city-wide traffic management and monitoring, smart parking, public transportation information services (bus, train, taxi, plane, etc.), logistics, real-time traffic, road speed limit monitoring and management etc., are deployed in smart cities. The sensors or mobile objects in ITS constantly generate mobility data and the scale at which this data is generated is witnessing an exponential increase in volumes. To store and subsequently analyze such massive data generated by sensors, new architectures are needed which are primarily designed for working with big data. In this work, we propose a big data analytics architecture for ITS. The proposed architecture has a built-in storage and analysis capability to work with ITS data and is composed of four modules, namely (1) Big Data Acquisition and Preprocessing Unit (2) Big Data Processing Unit (3) Big Data Analytics Unit and (4) Data Visualization Unit. A detailed analysis of ITS big data for monitoring the average speed of a vehicle at w.r.t. the time attribute is provided. The proposed architecture is evaluated using Hadoop thus validating the proof of concept. The empirical results are encouraging and open directions for future research.}

The proposed models aim at examining how city logistics measures could modify the restocking process of retailers and ho.re.ca. managers located within the urban area. The process is considered in terms of distribution channel: pull or push movements to bring freight to the economic activities. The analysis has been based on surveys carried out in the inner area of Rome. The study points out that deterministic behaviour exists in relation to goods types and that the choices for acquisition (i.e. distribution channel and restocking area) are generally joint choices. For this scope, different behavioural models were tested according to different hypothesis on random residual distributions.}

In order to be able to optimize their manufacturing and logistics processes, companies have to choose the most suitable lean principles to solve problems or to reach their target state. To solve this decision problem, it is important to identify objectives based on values of the decision-maker and to determine effects of lean principles and objectives. This paper presents a value-focused thinking driven identification of objectives and a system dynamics approach for understanding the interdependencies and dynamics of lean principles and objectives. This provides a transparency and better understanding for these interactions for the decision-maker in the decision-making process. Based on this knowledge, the most effective lean principles for the design of the production system can be chosen and successfully applied.}

abstract = {In this study, a method for assessing the costs of biodiesel production from waste frying oils in Beirut, Lebanon, was investigated with the aim of developing an economic evaluation of this alternative. A hundred restaurant and hotel enterprises in Beirut were surveyed for promoting them in participating in the biodiesel supply chain, and for data collection on waste frying oils generation, disposal methods and frequency, and acquisition cost. Also, waste frying oils were collected and converted into biodiesel using a one-step base catalyzed transesterification process. Physicochemical characteristics of the produced biodiesel were conforming to international standards. Data produced from laboratory scale conversion of waste frying oils to biodiesel, as well as data collected from the only biodiesel plant in Lebanon was used to determine the production cost of biodiesel. Geographic Information System was used to propose a real-time vehicle routing model to establish the logistics costs associated with waste frying oils collection. Comparing scenarios of the configuration collection network of waste frying oils, and using medium-duty commercial vehicles for collection, a logistics cost of US$/L 0.08 was optimally reached. For the calculation of the total cost of biodiesel production, the minimum, average, and maximum values for the non-fixed cost variables were considered emerging 81 scenarios for possible biodiesel costs. These were compared with information on the commercialization of diesel in Lebanon for the years 2011 through 2017. Although competitive with petroleum diesel for years 2011 to 2014, the total biodiesel cost presented less tolerance to declining diesel prices in the recent years. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the acquisition cost of waste frying oils is the key factor affecting the overall cost of biodiesel production. The results of this study validate the economic feasibility of waste frying oils' biodiesel production in the studied urban area upon enforcement of low waste frying oils' acquisition costs, and can help spur food service enterprises to become suppliers of biodiesel production feedstock and support a healthy development of the biodiesel industry in Lebanon.}

This paper provides an analytical approach to redesigning a supply chain network (SCN), considering its current infrastructure. While aiming to maximise total profit, we take into consideration the demand and price uncertainty and their correlation as two important risk factors, and formulate them using associated Brownian motions employed in a real options pricing approach. Our model captures multiple periods and cash flow aspects through a non-linear structure. In the solution approach, we apply a novel piecewise linear conversion. Our theoretical model is complemented by a realistic case study from the Australian cement industry. We demonstrate significant improvements in the financial position of the company after redesigning its SCN. For instance, SCN redesign increases total profit by 49%, while the profit from the existing product increases by 23%. The results also indicate that ignoring the effect of the correlation leads to profit overestimation.}

Colonoscopy is a complex procedure that requires bowel preparation, sedation, and has the potential for substantial risk. Given this, we investigated colonoscopy patients' perceived and actual understanding of the procedure.
Methods
Consecutive colonoscopy patients were enrolled and surveyed, with their caregivers, immediately prior to their procedure. Demographics, health literacy, socioeconomic status and perceived risks/benefits were assessed. Thematic analysis was conducted on open-ended responses and a 3-level outcome variable was created to categorize correctness of patients’ and caregivers’ understanding. Multinomial logistic regression was used to determine predictors of response level.
Results
Patients (N=1821) were 77% White, 60% female, and averaged 54 years old; caregivers were demographically similar. Among patients, bivariate analysis revealed that younger age, minority race, and low income, education, and health literacy were associated with incomplete understanding. Multinomial regression revealed that age, education, health literacy, first-time colonoscopy, and perceived risk-benefit difference discriminated among groups. Bivariate and multinomial results for caregivers were similar.
Conclusion
Patients and caregivers varied on information, understanding and misconceptions about colonoscopy. Implications are discussed for inadequate: 1. informed consent, 2. bowel preparation, and 3. emotional preparation for cancer detection or adverse events.
Practice Implications
Attention should be paid to patients’ understanding of the purpose, anatomy, and logistics of colonoscopy, preferably prior to bowel preparation.}

Many questions remain regarding the logistics of cooling (including length of treatment), and how best to manage complications of therapy, particularly shivering.

Moreover, a novel idea of integrating customer relationship management concept and supply chain management is proposed and incorporated into the mathematical modeling framework. The proposed scenario-based multi-objective model is then solved following robust optimization and revised multi-choice goal programming approaches. In order to discuss the managerial implications of the model and its results, the realization rates of the objectives, considering their importance to the supply chain, are illustrated.

abstract = {Abstract:
Strategic supply chain planning relies on accurate, long-range forecasts. Accurate forecasts, in turn, rely on the availability of suitable data and information from which a prediction can be made. In some domains, such as vendor managed inventory, product consumption data may not be available because of a lack of collaborative information. Delivery records are on occasion substituted for absent consumption data. This substitute information, however, can appear lumpy and intermittent due to the bullwhip effect and other logistics factors. The proposed ASACT (Aggregate, Smooth, Aggregate, Convert to Time-series) method applies aggregation and smoothing to transform delivery records into time-series data that creates a good approximation of actual consumption behavior; noise in the data is reduced while behavior patterns are preserved. Synthetic data is used to test the method against traditional methods, and real data is used to demonstrate the method's application in industry. Tests have shown that ASACT improves on the results produced by traditional methods.}

Considering the impact of the global supply chain and regional economy development, this study proposes different perspectives to analyse the development of the port hinterland, and applies these perspectives to Shenzhen Port in China. In accordance with the changing nature of a port's function, we view hinterland development from physical, logistics, and macroeconomic perspectives, and analyse the influencing factors from the shippers' viewpoint in terms of three driving forces: spatial, value, and organizational. We find that the influence of these driving forces and their relevant strategies differ from these three perspectives. For Shenzhen Port to develop its hinterland sustainably, its geographical boundaries should be extended in both directions (i.e. inland-bound and foreland-bound), and the structure of container throughput needs to be optimized. Some relevant strategies in this regard are proposed.}

abstract = {Decision making in biomass supply chain management is subject to uncertainties in a number of factors such as biomass yield, procurement prices, market demands, transportation costs, and processing technologies. To better understand such uncertainties requires statistical analysis and data-intensive computing enabled by cyberGIS (aka geographic information science and systems based on advanced cyberinfrastructure and e-science). Therefore, we have developed a cyberGIS approach to optimize biomass supply chains under uncertainties. Our approach (1) designs optimal biomass supply chains from regional to national scale with flexible spatial selection of study areas; (2) performs uncertainty and sensitivity analysis to quantify how various sources of uncertainty in the biomass supply chain contribute to the variation of optimal results; and (3) provides users with online geodesign features. This approach has been implemented as a decision support system through integration of data management, mathematical modeling, uncertainty and sensitivity analysis, scenario analysis, and result representation and visualization. An optimization modeling analysis of 7000 scenarios using Monte Carlo methods has been conducted to quantify the uncertainty and sensitivity impact of various input factors on ethanol production costs and optimal biomass supply chain configurations in Illinois, United States. The results from uncertainty analysis showed that the minimal ethanol production costs range from $2.30 to $3.43gal−1, considering uncertainties from biomass supply, transportation, and processing. The results of sensitivity analysis demonstrated that biomass-ethanol conversion rate was the most influential factor to ethanol production costs while the optimal biomass supply chain infrastructure was sensitive to changes in biomass yield, raw biomass transportation cost, and logistics loss rate. Leveraging high performance computing power through cutting-edge cyberGIS software, what-if scenario analysis has been evaluated to make decisions in case of unexpected events occurring in the supply chain operations.}

Furthermore, a behavioral model is presented that describes the joint choice of a hinterland transport chain, accounting for each of the above parties’ objectives: sea/dry ports seek to maximize throughput; intermodal carriers seek to maximize profits; and shippers seek to minimize logistics cost. The behavioral model is used in the analysis of unexplored areas in the hinterland transport chain literature, i.e. the fundamental issues of the existence and uniqueness of such chains.}

A BEKK-MGARCH model is employed for investigating these possible price-volatility spillovers. Overall, results suggest a limited negative effect of past volatile nonrenewable-energy prices influencing current wood-pellet price volatility. Specifically, high volatilities in nonrenewable-energy prices do not affect the volatility of wood-pellet prices.

This paper introduces a collaborative multiple centers vehicle routing problem with simultaneous delivery and pickup (CMCVRPSDP) to minimize operating cost and the total number of vehicles in the network. Distribution and pickup centers are allowed to share vehicles and customers in order to increase the entire network's efficiency and maximize profit. To provide the coalition coordinators with good routing solutions, we propose a hybrid heuristic algorithm which properly combines k-means and Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II). Based on clustering solutions, the proposed Hybrid NSGA-II (HNSGA-II) first generates a real coded population to bind our mathematical model constraints and to obtain a large number of feasible solutions which converge to optimality. Chromosomes are divided for genetic operations with partial mapped crossover and swap mutation algorithms, before their recombination to ensure the quality of our results. Comparisons with the traditional NSGA-II and the Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) algorithm indicate better performances of HNSGA-II in terms of objective function values. We also apply Cost Gap Allocation method (CGA) and the strictly monotonic path selection principle to examine profit allocation schemes. Numerical analyses on part of Chongqing city's logistics network show the superiority of HNSGA-II over MOPSO and NSGA-II on the practical case study, as well that of CGA over the Minimum Costs-Remaining Savings (MCRS), Shapley and Game Quadratic Programming (GQP) methods. In addition, the proposed profit allocation approach has supported the establishment of a grand coalition instead of two sub-coalitions. CMCVRPSDP optimization reduces long-haul transportation, improves the vehicle loading rate and facilitates sustainable development. Through the rational allocation of profits, the proposed solution methodology assures the stability and fairness among coalition members. The implementation is also important to design sustainable urban transportation networks.}

This study aimed to explore contextual factors and strategies that influenced physicians' engagement in efforts to improve IPCP in emergency departments.
Methods
This study was conducted within a HRSA-sponsored project that aimed to improve IPCP in four rural emergency departments. Data collection included in-depth interviews (n = 12) and observations over two years. Content analysis was applied to code and integrate findings.
Results
Physician engagement in efforts to improve IPCP was influenced by five categories of contextual factors (employment arrangements, scheduling, competing priorities, leadership, infrastructure) and six strategies (build on existing infrastructure, attend to logistics, strengthen interpersonal relationships, take physicians' perspective into account, engage leadership, communicate goals and successes).
Discussion/Conclusion
Emergency department staff can use these results to promote physician engagement in efforts to improve IPCP, an essential step toward improving patient outcomes.}

The sources of strategic inefficiencies that affect competitiveness are identified in the context of political, technological, economic, and social aspects. Strategic inefficiencies, business and operational, that affect the decision-making process, are detected in port activity. These are related to port governance, loss of time, logistical costs and lack of human capital. Critical factors affected by inefficiencies in export/import logistics chains are also detected which, if overcome, may reduce their logistical costs and increase port competitiveness. The greatest inefficiencies found in the public components and the private companies are related to waiting time (lead time) and time delays caused by the actors in the port business. It is observed that all strategic interest groups are not involved in the system and a lack of synergy is also perceived at business and operational levels in both public organizations and private companies. Logistic costs related to transport, inventory, storage, together with administrative and supply costs are also considered.

An interventionist strategy is compared against an existing dynamic picking strategy via a case study. We report benefits both in terms of order completion time and travel distance. This paper also introduces a set of system requirements for deploying an interventionist strategy based on a further case study.}

abstract = {Slow steaming has become common among shipping liners, with an estimated 75% of shipping liners and tramp traders employing the practice of cruising at a speed of 21 knots or less (down from the previous common cruising speed of 24 knots). The claimed benefits are reduced fuel costs, reduced emissions, and improved logistics, and it is clear that these benefits have been realized to varying extents by shipping liners. However, the shipping customers have not benefited to the same extent, and in fact the prevailing opinion is that they have actually suffered mainly via increased transit times (particularly significant for perishable goods such as foods) and increased inventory costs (affecting most if not all shippers). Shipping customers also claim that rather than having savings passed on from the shipping companies via lower freight rates, rates have actually increased.}

abstract = {Nowadays, industrial production environments are complex, volatile and driven by uncertainties. Manufacturing companies are striving for flexibility and adaptability to cope with these challenges and remain competitive. Decision-making and real-time reaction systems are promising concepts to cope with complex situations in industrial production environments. However, digitalization leads to an increasing amount of data describing the status of products and resources within an industrial production environment. In order to achieve near real-time monitoring and control of production and logistics processes, intelligent processing and analysis of the acquired data is necessary. As a result of this development, continuous data analysis plays a decisive role for analyzing extensive data streams in real-time. Patterns have to be recognized during the production process and actions have to be defined in order to realize an event-based production control. The main focus within this paper is the development of a methodology for an event-based production control. Furthermore, an exemplary implementation of the methodology will be presented by means of a prototypical implementation to optimize the exchange of material.}
