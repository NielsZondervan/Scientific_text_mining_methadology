abstract = {New infectious disease diagnostics are being introduced into clinical practice at high rates. For tests that are better, faster, and less expensive than what came before, adoption is easy. However, many new tests, though faster than conventional diagnostics, are more expensive. Whether they will add value to patient care must be evaluated and can best be assessed by randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs). Here, an overview of RCTs of new blood culture diagnostics is presented. Operational logistics of executing RCTs of new diagnostics are presented based on the authors' experience. For tests that facilitate appropriate use of antibiotics, involvement of an antimicrobial stewardship team in the associated clinical trial is important.}

Given a set of transportation requests, where the origin and the destination of each request are located far apart from each other, a logistics service provider must find feasible vehicle routes to fulfil those requests at minimum cost. When transporting freight over long distances, multimodal transportation provides a viable alternative to traditional unimodal road transportation. We introduce this new problem, which we call the multimodal long haul routing problem (MMLHRP), and present a mathematical formulation for it. Furthermore, we propose a matheuristic, using iterated local search within a column generation framework, for solving the MMLHRP. Results show that large cost savings can be achieved through multimodal transportation compared to unimodal road transportation.}

With global greenhouse gas emissions from maritime logistics accounts for about 2.5%, this study would take to account for shipment containerization strategies under carbon tax regulation to explore the influence of carbon tax regulation on maritime logistics carbon emission reduction. The motivation of this study comes from a real case example of freight consolidation and containerization problem (FCCP) in Indonesia. This study tries to model an actual problem faced by a third-party logistics provider in consolidating goods into various sizes of containers while keeping the total transportation costs as low as possible. The most significant contributions of this study are to incorporate environmental factors into the FCCP model and to illustrate the impacts of various carbon footprints schemes on both cost and carbon emissions. Therefore, shipment containerization strategies under various carbon footprints schemes are formulated to minimize the transportation costs, as well as to lower the amount of carbon emission from maritime and land transport modes. The methodology used is a case-based approach; it depicts product delivery activities from one origin hub in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, to the biggest retailer stores in Jakarta, Indonesia. The aim is to incorporate environmental factors and illustrate how the proposed policy balances both cost and carbon emissions. Under the proposed policy, a new mixed-integer programming model is introduced considering the freight consolidation and containerization problem. Based on the different groups of numerical results, we found that the shipment containerization strategy under carbon tax regulation gives a better outcome in terms of total transportation cost and total carbon emissions compared with the business as usual policy.}

At the end, they go to their laboratory to update the patients' health records. In addition to scheduling and routing of the caregivers, there are some other optimization decisions which can increase the competitive advantages of HHC organizations as a supply chain network. The location decisions of the pharmacies and laboratories and the assignment of patients to the nearest pharmacies are two of the several important logistics factors for an HHC organization. The literature shows that the green emissions and sustainability achievements for HHC logistics are still scarce. To cover more logistics and sustainability factors and make the HHC more practical, this study contributes a Green Home Health Care Supply Chain (GHHCSC) for the first time by a bi-objective location-allocation-routing model. Already applied successfully to this research area, the Simulated Annealing (SA) is also employed in this study. Another main innovation of this paper is to propose a set of new modified SA algorithms to better solve the proposed NP-hard problem. As a bi-objective optimization model, the epsilon constraint method is also utilized to check the algorithms’ results in small sizes. By using some multi-objective assessment metrics, the algorithms are compared with each other and their performance is evaluated. As such, some sensitivity analyses are performed to reveal the efficiency of the developed model. Finally, some managerial insights are deployed to achieve the sustainability for the HHC organizations.}

Due to restrictions in Bangkok and its metropolitan area, the routing problem becomes one with two types of time windows. A mixed integer programming model is formulated, which aims to minimize a cost function which consists of fixed vehicle costs, variable vehicle costs and fuel costs. This approach has its limits in terms of problem size. Therefore a genetic algorithm (GA) has been developed to approximate the optimal solution. The proposed GA has a specific initialization algorithm which generates feasible random solutions. A partial factorial design of GA parameters is implemented to determine the suitable parameter values, which guide the genetic algorithm. The solution of the GA and the mixed integer programming model of the current problems were compared. The maximum optimal gap was between 0 and 0.21%, while the computational time was reduced between 67.78 and 99.45%. The results show that the planning time by a dispatcher is reduced significantly and the cost is strongly reduced, due to the fact that less vehicles are used.}

This paper is the first attempt to explore the factors impacting Less-than-Truckload (LTL) freight load factors at a disaggregated level to the best of our knowledge. The paper analyzes the operation data provided by a leading LTL logistics company in China, using the beta regression finite mixture models. The results show that the under-loaded tours and over-loaded tours behave differently in terms of load factor determination. All variables' impacts vary across the different components, confirming the need to analyze these two scenarios separately using finite mixture models. For under-loaded tours, high shipping demand and the use of small vehicles are always positively and significantly associated with the load factor. For over-loaded LTL tours, the effects of transportation distance and leased vehicles are always positive and significant. Finally, implications for operations strategies and public policies are discussed based on the estimated results. These findings shed light on an in-depth understanding of LTL freight load factors and provide essential references for LTL logistics companies, transportation planners, policymakers, and researchers.}

To make procurement and production decisions simultaneously, a mixed-integer nonlinear mathematical programming model is proposed in a hybrid fuzzy-stochastic environment. To solve the proposed model, an efficient multi-stage algorithm is developed by re-formulating with a linearization scheme and employing a novel defuzzification process to cope with the proposed possibilistic programming. Then, a robust two-stage stochastic programming method is applied. Finally, the application of the model and the effectiveness of the solution method are examined through comprehensive numerical studies for the apparel industry.}

abstract = {Food system shocks are mediated through value chains and underlying market structures, characterised by elements of power. Power imbalances are assumed to be detrimental to food security and to economic welfare, but the links between market power and food system resilience have not been extensively explored. This paper considers how shocks are potentially mitigated or amplified by the increasing consolidation of market power in globally interconnected food supply chains. We use UK examples to highlight evolving power-resilience dynamics and challenges from the perspectives of supply chain actors and regulators. We find that the impact of market power on the resilience of food supply is mixed. Low functional diversity levels, inflexible contracts and homogenous processes may increase supply chain vulnerability. A degree of power in terms of financial capacity, robust logistics and cooperation can enable firms to better mitigate shock impacts. Episodic crises appear to highlight the value of cooperation and of supply chain redundancy or slack, rather than the efficiency of perfect competition. This suggests a more nuanced perspective on market power than the largely detrimental perception implied by dominant economic theory. The discussion of the role of power in the food system should also consider social and environmental accountabilities of dominant food system actors, and whether these are sufficiently considered by existing regulatory structures.}

abstract = {For many food products, such as fresh vegetable and fruit, proper handling of product leftovers is critical. In recent years, food leftover sharing (FLS) platforms that can provide a means to collect the unsold food products from individual retailers and create values from them have emerged. Motivated by this real world observation, we build a single supplier multi-retailer analytical supply chain model to explore the value of this kind of FLS platform. In the decentralized supply chain setting, we prove that the presence of FLS platform is beneficial to the retailers, the supplier, the consumers and the environment. Whether it benefits the supply chain economically depends on the logistics costs (incurred from the food product leftover collection by the FLS platform). We extend the analysis to the case with a centralized supply chain and show that the FLS platform is guaranteed to help improve the environment, but the consumers and the supply chain are only benefited when the logistics costs are sufficiently small. Sensitivity analyses are conducted which show that for both centralized and decentralized supply chain settings, the FLS platform is especially helpful in enhancing social welfare when the unit food product leftover cost is higher, the unit benefit derived from reusing the food product leftovers is higher, or the unit logistics cost is lower. We further consider the case when the logistics cost with the use of platform is high, propose the use of government sponsors to help and provide the conditions under which this sponsor is well-justified with respect to social welfare enhancement.}

Since VRPSPDTW is NP-hard and exact methods are only applicable to small-scale instances, heuristics and meta-heuristics are commonly adopted. In this paper we propose a novel Memetic Algorithm with efficienT local search and Extended neighborhood, dubbed MATE, to solve this problem. Compared to existing algorithms, the advantages of MATE lie in two aspects. First, it is capable of more effectively exploring the search space, due to its novel initialization procedure, crossover and large-step-size operators. Second, it is also more efficient in local exploitation, due to its sophisticated constant-time-complexity move evaluation mechanism. Experimental results on public benchmarks show that MATE outperforms all the state-of-the-art algorithms, and notably, finds new best-known solutions on 12 instances (65 instances in total). Moreover, a comprehensive ablation study is also conducted to show the effectiveness of the novel components integrated in MATE. Finally, a new benchmark of large-scale instances, derived from a real-world application of the JD logistics, is introduced, which can serve as a new and more challenging test set for future research.}

This paper theoretically studies the moderating role of government in pricing and greening decisions of chain-to-chain competition in developing substitutable green products under government involvement in supporting green product distribution and/or recycling through assigning monetary tariffs to customers and practically adjusts a real-world case study of the Iranian motorcycle industry issues. We examine two competitive supply chains (SCs) consisting of one retailer and one manufacturer under two-way logistics, i.e. forward SC that distributes green products and backward SC that collects pollutant products from the market. In addition to maximizing the profit of each SC member and minimizing government expenditure, reductions in environmental pollution are also examined. This study examines the impact of government policies in equilibrium strategies through six scenarios, based on different government elective policies, and using Nash or Stackelberg game structures. A computational analysis of the case study reveals that under more constrained budget situations, the government should resist the urge to reduce recycling tariffs, compared with distribution tariffs. The greatest reduction in environmental pollution is achievable through: government financial support only for recycling with the lowest investment rejection behavior, following a Nash game, reducing greening costs, increasing tendencies towards environmental protection, and increasing the rate of recyclable products. The greatest profit for firms is obtainable through: government financial support of distribution and recycling logistics with the lowest tendency towards environmental protection, following a Nash game, reducing greening costs, reducing the investment rejection behavior of the government, and increasing the rate of recyclable products.}

Accounting for a product’s reputation, we build a Stackelberg differential game model to study the optimal strategy between the e-commerce platform and the supplier. In our model, the supplier is offered two options of entry into the platform, namely, Fulfillment by Plan of Open Platform (FBP) and Sales on Plan of Open Platform (SOP). We then discuss, based on the results of numerical analysis, the supplier’s optimal entry mode and the dynamic pricing method associated with each mode. We find that the supplier would be more likely to choose the FBP mode if the product’s reputation is better or the commission rate the platform charges the supplier is higher. In our model, the e-commerce platform’s profit is always higher in the FBP than the SOP mode. Our results indicate that, to induce the supplier to choose FBP, the e-commerce platform should enhance its logistics service, put more efforts toward sales promotion, and attempt to lure suppliers with good reputations to participate.}

The aim of this paper is to capture the reasons for the small share of multimodal transport and suggest measures to promote multimodal transport. To collect data, a multiple-case study was conducted involving ten logistics service providers. The barriers to multimodal freight transport are analyzed in a holistic manner using interpretive structural modeling. Overall, fifteen barriers are presented which are classified as demand-related barriers, shipment characteristics, infrastructural/supply-related barriers, organizational barriers and legal / political barriers. Based on that, a bottom-up approach involving the ten logistics service providers (LSPs) is used to develop user-centered policy measures for multimodal transport. The direct involvement of LSPs facilitates acceptance of the proposed measures. The internalization of external costs, efficient information provision and education/training/awareness raising are rated as high impact measures to promote multimodal transport.}

We primarily examined the LC's lessons-learned reports, supported by semi-structured interviews with the managers of LC and its supply network members. The findings revealed that: (i) early anticipation of needs in disaster-affected areas and lessons-learned exercises are the microfoundations of sensing capabilities; (ii) building capacity, supply network service provision, collaboration with logistics service providers, local partner engagement, building trust, and reconciliation are the microfoundations of seizing capabilities; and (iii) coordination and adaptability are the microfoundations of reconfiguring capabilities in the humanitarian aid context. Additionally, we identified relevant microprocesses for this context, which are preparing, engaging, strengthening, streamlining, and responding.

The research was develop on the ba-sis the following research methods: literature and legal acts analysis, market situation review, statistical data analysis and survey research. The time scope of the survey research covered the period 2020. The research was carried out in two directions. The first area concerned the spread of remote work in Polish enterprises during the pandemic. The second area concerned the study of this phenomenon in the case of companies from the logistics industry. The diagnosis of the prevalence of remote work among Polish enterprises and the analysis of the survey results showed that during the pandemic, solutions typical of the Smart City concept, working from home or working remotely have become a reality for many organizations. Remote work has become, in the case of many organizations, the basic form of work. However, the necessary legal and organizational solutions in this area do not keep up with the speed and universality of re-mote work implementation. The results of the diagnosis in the field of implementing remote work solutions and the results of research conducted by companies from the logistics industry can be used as reference material in further research on remote work as one of the Smart City concepts in other industries and types of organizations, e.g. public.}

Researching hinterland logistics in Sweden, this article conducts a case study on a dry port and the warehouse industry. The results show that the traffic share of inland terminals was higher during and soon after the conflict. Thus, this study suggests that dry ports are significant as potential solutions for this kind of disruption.}

We present a procedure based on data envelopment analysis (DEA) to identify those candidate zones, using the density of deliveries received in each zone as the output and indicators related to street pattern, zone population or transportation accessibility as inputs. Using this data, DEA identifies which zones are saturated, and should therefore be the ones requiring more attention from the authorities in terms of improving freight deliveries in the urban area. This procedure thus provides a useful tool for determining priority locations for implementing city logistics measures, helping local authorities in the decision-making process. We have illustrated this methodology with an application to the city of Seville, in Spain, resulting in the identification of 15 zones out of 129 as saturated.}

Meanwhile, it is essential to identify the transformation path towards sustainable freight transport for every nation. This paper has presented a framework based on transition management (TM) theory to identify, classify, and measure the important environmentally responsible transport practices (ERTPs). This work utilizes a two-step methodology comprised of a grey clustering (GC) algorithm and a compromise ranking method, i.e., VIseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) for prioritization of ERTPs performance. The GC algorithm is used to classify the ERTPs based on their impact on selected transport processes. Initially, this study identifies thirty-five ERTPs and four transport performance clusters. The proposed framework is validated with the Indian freight transport industry. The GC algorithm classifies twenty-one and fourteen practices as a high priority and moderate priority, respectively. The VIKOR method is used to compute the group utility, individual regret, and possibility value of high priority ERTPs. The ERTPs such as developing efficient freight terminal, compliance with government transport emission law and practice, promoting the use of the green container, environmental certification of freight carriers, and using alternative fuels are found as poor performing practices in the Indian freight transport industry. The proposed decision model robustness is tested with the sensitivity analysis, and a final ranking of the high priority ERTPs is presented. The outcomes of this research help logistics practitioners and policymakers in managing the ERTPs of freight logistics systems and develop a roadmap for improving freight transport sustainability.}

abstract = {The Paris Agreement appeals to all countries around the world for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Nowadays, logistics companies do not only consider improving service quality and reducing operating costs but also should take a particular corporate social responsibility: reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Minimizing greenhouse gas emissions has been emerged in vehicle routing problems in many investigations, while most of the models are deterministic. The feedback from logistics practice reveals that the workers often encounter uncertainties when providing services to customers. The decisions made without considering uncertainties show less robustness when carrying the logistics activities according to the given scheduling. Consequently, in this study, this is the first attempt to develop a relative robust optimization model for a vehicle routing problem with synchronized visits and uncertain scenarios considering greenhouse gas emissions. In this study the greenhouse gas emissions is evaluated by the fuel consumption cost. Due to the NP-hard of the studied model, a hybrid tabu search and simulated annealing is proposed to solve it. The experimental results on the popularly used benchmark instances demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is efficient and effective. The comparison performed among the solutions obtained by different types of models has highlighted the importance of considering uncertainties. Then, the sensitivity analysis is performed to observe the change of fuel consumption cost with varying types of vehicles. Statistical analysis is carried out to further validate the different models. Finally, two bi-objective optimization based scenarios have been established to demonstrate the trade-off between GHG emissions and robustness indicators. The proposed models can be applied to some practical applications, such as logging truck routing planing.}

Growing demand for freight movement, along with industry commitment to minimize its environmental impact, has increased emphasis on port and vessel efficiency. Yet, few objective performance measures exist to inform decision making for system improvements. There is an existing gap in quantifiable and objective metrics for maritime transport systems which motivated this work to investigate waterway performance efficiencies through big data analytics. Availability of big data affords practitioners and researchers the opportunity to develop new performance-based metrics to improve maritime logistics. This study focused on short sea shipping logistics of iron ore in the Great Lakes and makes three fundamental contributions. Principally, we propose a maritime transport efficiency (MTE) metric attained through fusion of data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) and navigation lock data that integrates travel time and vessel payload. We present a linear model to predict vessel capacity based on water surface elevation which will enable practitioners to better adapt to seasonal changes and dredging needs specific to the Great Lakes. Additionally, we present travel time statistics for bulk carriers on the waterway observed through historical AIS data which extends the body of knowledge from earlier works and establishes a reference for system performance. Techniques presented here are effective in capturing travel time statistics in a non-linear interconnected system. This data-driven approach offers new insights for logistics planning and optimization with direct applications to short sea shipping and inland waterways systems. These insights to port and fleet performance allow for querying and simulation of cost impact from investment strategies aimed to improve efficiency or maximize value for operational expenses.}

In this context, this work aims to introduce a system that is able to adjust order processing dynamically, and optimise intralogistics transportation regarding various generic intralogistics target criteria. The logistics system under consideration consists of various means of transport for autonomous decision-making and fulfilment of transport orders with defined source-sink relationships. The context of this work is set by introducing the Learning Factory Werk 150 with its existing hardware and software infrastructure and its defined target figures to measure the performance of the system. Specifically, the important target figures cost and performance are considered for the transportation system. The core idea of the system’s logic is to solve the problem of order allocation to specific means of transport by linking a Genetic Algorithm with a Multi-Agent System. The implementation of the developed system is described in an application scenario at the learning factory.}

In the aftermath of recent disasters, the SE played significant roles to help the affected people and support official responders. However, the literature has not effectively explored these roles, and thus, no framework can support the systematic inclusion of the SE in disasters management. This paper aims to address the gap through a two-stage exploratory research approach. First, we conduct a systematic literature review to identify the extent to which the SE is taken into consideration in disasters. After that, we investigate the role of three Iranian SE-based companies that were involved in the 2019 Iran floods response. We collect empirical data by conducting semi-structured interviews and reviewing official reports. Our findings indicate that very few studies discuss the different roles of the SE in disasters, although SE companies have often provided effective solutions to address critical post-disaster logistics challenges. Four research propositions are presented to describe emerging roles for SE companies. The contribution of our study is twofold. First, our research identifies the different roles that the SE could play in disasters and therefore, brings a new perspective to the literature. Second, the study suggests opportunities for collaboration and partnership models from the point of origin to delivery that can support coordination and logistics in disasters.}

However, little research has been completed on the comfort of head mounted displays such as smart glasses and how to alter them to increase their product lifecycle. Altered Vuxiz® glasses are used in this work to study comfort, preference, and performance while executing common logistical order picking and shipment putting tasks. The impact of design type (weighted front, side, or back) was investigated using comfort rating scales. Device preference surveys, the participants adjustments made to the glasses and task performance were also captured. There was no significant difference in device preference regardless of task type. Despite the side weighted arrangement being the most comfortable, the participants still were uncomfortable. For companies considering investing in smart glasses, other alternatives should be considered to extend the lifecycle of head mounted display devices.}

Two main reasons for this are the relative infancy of a macroeconomic view of logistics as well as the paucity of the data building blocks that can facilitate the development of this view, especially in emerging economies. Objective, comprehensible, and useful intelligence is required to enable data-driven policy development and to facilitate targeted investments and efficiency initiatives over the medium and long term for the management of transport as a strategic national resource. Established freight demand models in developed economies cater to the information availability and infrastructure requirements of mature economies.

In some countries, where legislation is appropriately applied to the logistics of marine fishing operations, some measures of containment and fisheries management are being implemented. However, other countries have no effective plans for the sustainable development of the sector. In this paper, we have compiled information on the historical discrepancies in fisheries management in the extensive Brazilian waters and used it to illustrate the institutional neglect of this important blue-economy sector. Since the 1930s, when the first management agencies were registered, fisheries management has been handled by at least 10 different federal agencies. This discontinuity has resulted in a country that is ignorant, overall, of the quantity fished, where fishing occurs, and the status of its fish stocks. The only available long-term fishing production data is held by small state departments or marine protected areas and does not come close to reflecting the total catch of the country, with its continental dimensions and its mix of artisanal and industrial fisheries. For this reason, the present work has compiled information on the years of neglect in the governance of the fishing sector. In addition, we suggest the creation of a pivotal management model, based on three main pillars, for sustainable fisheries development.}

The evidence presented herein upholds the importance of IT and R&D team structure for strategic decisions and to better exploiting firm’s innovation capabilities. Concretely, we argue that R&D team structure (centralized vs formalized vs autonomous) moderates the relationship between IT processes and innovation because it influences the way in which IT is utilized. Considering these facts, we focus on a specific type of innovation, Product-Service Innovation (PSI), largely underexplored despite being increasingly important in modern manufacturing companies. PSI differs from other technological innovations in that it involves continuous engagement with customers and logistics. Through estimation of a Multiple-Indicators Multiple-Causes (MIMIC) model with a unique sample of 352 Manufacturing Multinational Enterprises (MMNEs), we find that customer and logistics IT processes are positively linked to higher levels of PSI and that, as hypothesized, service R&D team structure moderates this relationship. In firms with autonomous R&D teams, customer-based IT processes lead to higher PSI levels, whereas in firms with formalized R&D teams, logistics-based IT processes is conducive to higher PSI levels. IT processes are not an input of PSI in centralized service R&D teams.}

However, such potential cannot be achieved without blockchain “oracles” needed to bridge the on-chain (i.e., blockchain system) and off-chain (i.e., real-life physical project) worlds. This study presents an innovative solution that exploits smart construction objects (SCOs). It develops a SCOs-enabled blockchain oracles (SCOs-BOs) framework. To instantiate this framework, the system architecture of a blockchain-enabled construction supply chain management (BCSCM) system is developed and validated using a case study, whereby four primary smart contracts are examined in the context of off-site logistics and on-site assembly services. The validation results show that accurate data is retrieved against malicious data in each request, and the corresponding reputation scores are successfully recorded. The innovativeness of the research lies in two aspects. In addition to mobilizing SCOs as blockchain oracles to bridge the on-chain and off-chain worlds, it develops a decentralized SCO network to avoid the single point of failure (SPoF) problem widely existing in blockchain systems. This study contributes to existing research and practice to harness the power of blockchain in construction.}

In the algorithm, the temporal-spatial distance is introduced to cluster the customers to generate an initial population to improve the quality of the initial solution. Adaptive neighborhood search times strategy and simulated annealing inferior solution acceptance mechanism are used to balance the diversification and exploitation in the algorithm iteration process.

However, Urban Freight is not a very well understood among the administrators and decision makers, especially in Indian cities. In order to make our cities sustainable, this particular field of transport planning is extremely important because an efficient and effective logistics sector is vital to the economy. New models for management of freight are required in urban areas in which, the local authorities need to play a pro-active role. In larger cities, there are still some considerations towards the urban freight but in the emerging medium size cities, it is completely missing. So, this paper attempts to contribute towards laying a groundwork towards understanding of the characteristics of urban freight logistics in medium size cities of India. For this, detailed primary surveys were done in the case city Udaipur and they have been used to create a profile of Freight Generating and Freight Handling areas in the city, along with detailed understanding of Supply Chain of the most important commodities.}

A predictive tool to determine the end-date of cheese maturation (E-index, in days) was developed using a set of 425 NIR-HS images acquired during industrial-scale cheese production. The NIR-HS images were obtained by scanning the cheeses at 14, 16, 18 and 20 months of ripening, before a final sensorial assessment in which all cheeses were approved by 20 months. Regression modelling by partial least squares (PLS) was used to explore the relationship between average spectra and E-index. The best PLS model achieved 69.6% accuracy in the prediction of E-index when standard normal variate (SNV) correction and mean centring pre-processing were applied. Thus, NIR-HS image modelling can be useful as a complementary tool to optimise the logistics/efficiency of cheese ripening facilities by rapid and non-destructive prediction of the end-date of ripening for individual cheeses. However, the commercial application will require future improvements in the predictive capacity of the model, e.g. for larger datasets and repetitive scans of cheeses on random occasions.}

While order acceptance and scheduling feature of the problem includes the joint decision of which orders to accept and how to schedule them due to the limited capacity in production environment and due to the order delivery time requirements for the customers, logistics aspect of the problem entails the decision of how to batch the accepted orders for the delivery in conjunction with the production scheduling. The objective is to maximize the net revenue in line with the literature of order acceptance and scheduling problem. We first present a mixed integer linear programming and a constraint programming model for this problem. To tackle large size problem instances in which these models fail, we propose an iterated local search algorithm using a new local search scheme. To evaluate the performance of the proposed local search scheme, a variant of this algorithm is developed which replaces the relevant scheme with tabu search. Computational results show that the proposed models achieve small optimality gaps for the small size problems, but their performances deteriorate significantly as the problem size enlarges. For the large size problem instances, the iterated local search algorithm using the proposed local search scheme achieves smaller optimality gaps compared to the one with the tabu search algorithm.}

Despite that previous studies have examined external determinants such as input resource, labor pooling, and knowledge spillovers, a small portion of literature aims at emphasizing the impacts from local contexts. This research therefore attempts to investigate the spatial variations of the sectoral agglomeration economies and their relationships to built environments and socio-demographics. By computing the location quotient (LQ) of sectoral employment in Hong Kong, the spatial distribution of agglomeration economies is measured at the level of District Council Constituency Area (DCCA). We then derive built environment and socio-demographic factors and evaluate their associations with the agglomeration economies using ordinary least squares regression (OLS) and geographically weighted regression (GWR) models. Our results exhibit a considerable spatial heterogeneity across economic sectors, highlighting that sectoral economies tend to be concentrated in a few particular regions. Further, the findings from regression analysis reveal that such clustering activities have distinct and close relationships with locational factors, suggesting that sector-specific agglomerations economies are preferential to various locational factors. Ultimately, data-driven geographical evidence is supplemented by this study to current literature for understanding local agglomeration economies in a metropolitan context. The implications from our research findings and policy recommendations for local and regional economic development are discussed.}

Decoupling based on event mechanisms and multi-objective optimization will be used in the design of methods, which will be continuously optimized in the simulation and will eventually be validated. After the implementation of an air conditioner line, the production capacity increased by 58.3 %, the WIP decreased by 77.8 %, the balance rate of the production line increased by 25.2 %, and the per capita production capacity increased by 29.8 %.

abstract = {Research Objectives
To identify individual- and dyadic-level factors associated with caregiver burden in couples experiencing post-stroke swallowing difficulties (dysphagia). As burden negatively impacts survivor and caregiver well-being, it is important to understand the variables that contribute to post-stroke caregiver burden.
Design
Cross-sectional online survey.
Setting
General community.
Participants
A volunteer sample of 28 adult stroke survivors with dysphagia (mean age 60 years) and their spouses (mean age 57 years). Survivors were >3 months post-stroke (median 12.5 months) and living with their spouse who was providing some degree of caregiving.
Interventions
Not applicable.
Main Outcome Measures
Dependent variable: dysphagia-related caregiver burden. Independent variables: swallowing-specific quality of life; stroke impact (Stroke Impact Scale; SIS); dietary restrictiveness (based on consumption of texture modified food and drink); survivor, spouse, and dyadic congruence of appraisal of dysphagia's impact on the social aspect and logistics of mealtimes (e.g., socializing during meals; meal preparation).
Results
Increased burden was significantly associated with greater survivor- and spouse-perceived impact of dysphagia on the logistics of mealtimes (r=.547, p=.002 and r=.758, p < .001, respectively), but was not associated with dyadic congruence of perceived impact (p=.113). Increased burden was also associated with increased dietary restrictiveness (r=-.647, p < .001) and decreased swallowing-specific quality of life (r=-.566, p=.001). Finally, burden was not associated with measures of stroke impact/severity (p=.265, .692, .120, .099 for physical, cognitive, emotional and social SIS subscales).
Conclusions
Factors related to dysphagia-related caregiver burden are multifactorial and include both survivor (dietary restrictiveness, swallowing-specific quality of life, perceived impact of dysphagia on mealtime logistics) and spousal (perceived impact of dysphagia on mealtime logistics) variables. These results support the interrelatedness of stroke survivor and caregiver health and well-being. There is a need for speech-language pathologists and other rehabilitation professionals to focus on the lived experience of both patients and their families in developing treatment plans. Further, incorporating increased dietary education and counseling into dysphagia management may facilitate reduced burden for stroke survivors and their families.

Future initiatives will also need to enhance safety and well being of residents. City Logistics provides a framework for systematically identifying problems and developing innovative solutions that involves a multi-stakeholder approach, building effective partnerships between shippers, carriers, and receivers while considering the impacts on residents. Schemes such as Urban Consolidation Centers and off-hour deliveries have good potential for minimizing the impacts of freight in urban areas. The Physical Internet based on open, shared, and integrated logistics systems involving coordination between modes to achieve high levels of consolidation provides a useful direction for future urban freight systems. A description of how parcel lockers, loading dock reservation systems, and shared freight systems can be designed and implemented to improve the sustainability of urban is presented.

Since the location of marine debris is not fixed, we first apply the GNOME software to predict the trajectory of marine debris and determine its location. Then, the logistics network is used to optimize the collection of marine debris. A mixed integer linear programming model for debris vessel routing is proposed. The objective function is to minimize the total cost, which includes the fuel cost consisting of is a piecewise linear function, labor cost, and fixed cost consisting of rent and insurance relative to the vessels used, taking into account the vessel weight capacity, fuel tank capacity, and time windows constraint at each debris location. We propose a hybrid algorithm of adaptive large-scale neighborhood search, combined with a wolf pack algorithm. This paper takes Yangtze River Estuary to the East China Sea as an example to verify the proposed model and algorithm. The results show that, compared with the worst-case, the most appropriate collection time can save up to 6.38% of the cost, which is about $75,590 per calendar year. The sensitivity analysis of debris weight and vessel capacity is also performed.}

While there is a lack of research on the CLP optimization with the goal of achieving CLSS, particularly lacking research that taking the main grain production areas at the provincial scale as a study area. Hence, taking Heilongjiang Province in China as the study area, this paper uses the regional interpolation of ArcGIS spatial analysis and Auto-Logistics method to diagnose the common driving factors of CLSS and CLP change, and further sets up different development scenarios with the goal of CLSS to carry out the study of CLP optimization through the introduction of Future Land Use Simulation (FLUS) model. The results showed that: Firstly, the dynamic changes of paddy field, dryland and cultivated land were the most intense in the eastern Sanjiang Plain, the second in the western Songnen Plain, the weakest in the north-south axis, and the changes of paddy field and dryland were more intense in the later period (2010–2015) than in the earlier period (1995–2010); Secondly, regional interpolation in ArcGIS and Auto-Logistics method can effectively and reasonably spatialize, and diagnose the key factors (terrain and geomorphology including elevation and slope, socio-economic (distance to residential area, agricultural three wastes index) and farmland productivity potential) which affect the change of CLSS and CLP; Thirdly, the Kappa test coefficient of CLP optimization based on FLUS model is 0.898, with good simulation accuracy, meaning the combination of Auto-logistic and FLUS can achieve high-precision simulation of CLP. The simulation results that under the integrated control scenarios of food security, ecological protection and economic development, the regional food security, ecological protection and economic development are considered comprehensively, and the contradictions among the three are coordinated, which is more reasonable and conducive to the improvement of CLSS. Fourthly, the policies on controlling the growth rate of paddy fields, rationally reducing rural residential areas and decreasing agricultural three wastes should be strengthened to implement the optimal CLP and improve CLSS. The results bestow convincing insights on decision-making for the implementation of the optimal distribution of cultivated land resources and the compilation of the national land space plan, and also provide an important reference for the study area to improve CLSS by optimizing CLP.}

We derive upper bounds from Lagrangian and surrogate relaxations of a mathematical model of the problem. We introduce a constructive heuristic and a metaheuristic refinement. We study the computational complexity of the proposed methods and evaluate their practical performance through extensive computational experiments on benchmarks from the literature and on new sets of randomly generated instances.}

To solve the problem, we first propose an innovative search algorithm for solving the traditional multi-customer joint replenishment problem in a given zone. Then we design a GA-based framework to handle the corresponding districting problem based on the performance of each district evaluated by using the proposed search algorithm. The proposed methodologies are demonstrated by using an example of solving MJRPDC for a bank.}

In this outlook, blockchain is a cutting-edge technology that is already transforming and remodeling the relationships between all members of logistics and supply chain systems. Yet, while studies on blockchain have gained a relative pace over the recent years, the literature on this topic does not report sufficient research cases on blockchain adoption behavior at the individual level. The present study, therefore, aims to bridge this gap, notably by helping understand the individual blockchain adoption behavior in the logistics and supply chain field in India and the USA. Drawing on the emerging literature on blockchain, supply chain and network theory, as well as on technology acceptance models (TAMs), we have developed a model based on a slightly-altered version of the classical unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT). The model being developed was then estimated using the Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). As the model was eventually supported, the results obtained revealed the existence of distinct adoption behaviors between India-based and USA-based professionals. In parallel, the findings appear as a useful contribution to and a sign of progress for the literature on IT adoption, SCM, and blockchain.}

It is the purpose of this paper to describe the basis and the use of an integral methodology for defining better loading/unloading bays in terms of location, capacity and number. The methodology is used in a congested Mexican medium size city: Queretaro. The procedure consists of several steps that start with the modeling of the freight generation in order to build scenarios under micro-simulation techniques, thus creating a potential solution under the consideration of such infrastructure as service areas. Having as inputs the number of attracted local freight trips; the commercial activity needs; the types of vehicles, and the geometry of the streets, the output from such procedure consists of a proposal for the ideal of such infrastructure in terms of its location, size and number. The use of such methodology could become a valuable tool for planners and practitioners in the field of urban logistics, to better manage the delivery of goods and the urban space in congested areas, further mitigating the nuisances due to urban freight.}

More specifically, the action research method was applied in two industry case studies that implemented and tested the designed architecture in a global logistics environment. Case Study A examined the blockchain application in cross-border cargo movements whereas Case Study B investigated the application in a liquid chemical logistics company serving to petroleum industries. Our research analysis has identified that the Case A subject had disconnected systems and services for blockchain wherein the big data interactions had failed (failure case). Whereas in Case B, the company has achieved nearly 25% increase in revenue through its customer service after the blockchain implementation and thereby reduction in paperwork and carbon emissions (success case). This research contributes to the advancement of the body of knowledge to big data and blockchain by identifying key implementation guideline and issues for blockchain in supply chain management. Further, action-based research coupled with a case study approach has been used to evaluate the application aspects of the architecture's scalability and functionality of bigdata and blockchain in supply chain management.}

As a vital operational component, manual order picking operations are highly prone to infection spread among the workers, and thus, susceptible to interruption. This study revisits the well-known order batching problem by considering a new overlap objective that measures the time pickers work in close vicinity of each other and acts as a proxy of infection spread risk. For this purpose, a multi-objective optimization model and three multi-objective metaheuristics with an effective seeding procedure are proposed and are tested on the data obtained from a major US-based logistics company. Through extensive numerical experiments and comparison with the company’s current practices, the results are discussed, and some managerial insights are offered. It is found that the picking capacity can have a determining impact on reducing the risk of infection spread through minimizing the picking overlap.}

Shippers, brokers, and third-party logistics providers have the duty to exercise reasonable care in the selection of carriers by examining the safety record and practices prior to engaging their services and to continue monitoring their performance throughout the engagement period. The trend toward the one vehicle, owner-operator “carrier,” with a known risk to the traveling public through a record of a high rate of regulatory violations and crashes, reinforces the responsibility on the part of shippers, brokers, and third-party logistics providers to ensure that they analyze the safety record and management practices of these “owner-operator” drivers.}

This study investigates the decision-making problem of an O2O freight platform facing uncertain demand and carbon emission constraints to achieve sustainable development and establish an environment-friendly image. By receiving customer orders online and then delivering them offline, the platform chooses the optimal dispatching time and pricing level to maximize its profit under a limited carbon cap. We consider a stochastic model with two kinds of demand functions, i.e., additive and multiplicative cases, and solve the optimization problems. By adopting a data set from a leading O2O freight platform in China, we find that the proposed model can effectively increase the revenue of the platform by more than 20 % if the platform increases the price appropriately. The results further show that market parameters such as potential market size and price elasticity have a more significant influence on the price decision than logistics parameters such as the fixed shipping cost and holding cost per unit volume per unit time, while logistics parameters affect the dispatching time decision more significantly than market parameters. With respect to the profit, as the carbon cap increases, the profit of the platform first climbs up to a peak point and then decreases with the further increase of the cap due to rising inventory holding costs. Furthermore, the O2O platform can benefit from a large-scale market and thus might suffer a loss at its start-up stage. Our study contributes to the literature on the O2O platform and the freight transportation planning with the consideration of sustainable development.}

In the omnichannel scenario, the retailer can provide time-sensitive consumers with a quick logistics service by implementing the Ship-from-Store option. We focus on the value of the Ship-from-Store option and explore the effects of this option on the pricing decisions of the retailer and platform. We also explore how consumer heterogeneities (time sensitivity and transportation costs) affect the retailer’s omnichannel operations. In addition, we identify conditions under which the retailer can benefit from the Ship-from-Store option. Some managerial insights are provided.}

It is important to note from the outset that one of the activities of supply chain management is logistics. The Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals (2014) states that “logistics is that part of the Supply Chain Management that plans, implements, and controls the efficient, effective forward and reverse flow and storage of goods, services, and related information between point of origin and point of consumption in order to meet customers’ requirements.” Christopher (2011) defines logistics as “the process of strategically managing the procurement, movement and storage of goods.” Within the supply chain, any decision of one activity will inevitably spread up and downstream, and the interaction among activities is not always positive. In fact, gains in one activity may result in loss in another one. This chapter provides a global overview of the forces that influence freight transport sector. The discussion of key drivers and trends in logistics and supply chain management will follow the STEEP approach.

The reasons for the difficulties in transport and logistics services are the complex climatic and geographical features of the region. By comparing the branching of the road network in the western and eastern regions of the Arctic zone of Russia, it was determined that the western part is much more developed than the eastern one. This is due to the uneven distribution of the population in the territory of the Arctic zone. However, in these conditions, a significant part of the residents of the eastern part is not provided with proper transport services. Since large-scale construction and reconstruction of transport infrastructure facilities in the field of road transport throughout the Arctic zone of the Russian Federation will involve enormous material costs, the most rational solution to the problem is to develop an intelligent transport and logistics system for servicing the area based on the categorization of its territories according to the parameters of the transport process as well as natural and social factors using a mathematical apparatus. Within the framework of the developed system, one of the starting points for planning the transport process is the mechanism for selecting rolling stock, taking into account the peculiarities of the Arctic zone of the Russian Federation.}

Therefore integrating different transportation modes have become crucial for achieving cost and time savings in most supply chain systems. This paper presents a framework for evaluating the potential for implementing air-maritime integration. First we identified ten most influencing factors to establish a air-maritime integrated logistics hub using expert opinion and literature. Meanwhile two methods of integration, substitution and complementary were identified. AHP analysis was used to derive important weights to influencing factors and to determine the best method of integration. Finally IPA analysis was used to identify relative importance and current performance of individual factors and to classify them to four quadrants. Future actions required for implementing air-maritime integrated logistics were discussed based on the IPA classification. The framework was applied to assess the air-maritime integration potential of Sri Lanka. As per the results of the analysis, the best suited method for Sri Lanka was found to be the complementary method. Results also suggested that worldwide connectivity and centralized location are the most important criteria for implementing integrated logistics. By further improving the analysis procedure, this can be used for any other scenario in the world for evaluating the potential for air-sea integration.}

Firstly, the scope and boundary are defined, and the processes of the method and preparation are illustrated. Then, emergy models for the sustainability evaluation that comprise production quality emergy, production time emergy, production logistics cost emergy and production resources consumption emergy models are established. An integrated assessment is performed to acquire a best plan of outsourcing machining, and the corresponding evaluation indicators can be determined.

abstract = {The present study aims to present new archaeometric data from a wide typological rank of ceramics collected in Ksar Seghir (Morocco) and Ceuta (Spain), two different archaeological sites in the south bank of the Strait of Gibraltar occupied by the Portuguese from the 15th to the middle of the 16th centuries. We characterise and illustrate the most common ceramic fabrics and shapes found in these settlements, only possible by the intensive excavation of these two sites. Its mineralogical and chemical analyses confirm the idea that Seville and Lisbon were the most significant production centres in the Iberian Peninsula to supply the two Portuguese North African strongholds. These results reinforce the idea that Seville and Lisbon, besides being two great pottery workshops, played a complementary role as key cities in the logistics of the Iberian overseas expansion since its early beginning. The combination of the typological and archaeometrical studies will allow to better identify the centres of production of these ceramics, which were widely disseminated in the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean during this period.}

abstract = {The paper presents a cleaner production and distribution model for global facility network that offers reverse logistics services under the warranty period. Hybrid manufacturing and storage facilities with flexible capacity are considered to save the extra setup and maintenance cost linked with establishing new reverse logistics facilities. The carbon emissions are accounted for the various activities related to product manufacturing and return. The carbon cap and trade policy is considered for regulating emissions. The dynamic mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model discussed in the paper optimizes the total cost of the network including costs associated with reverse logistics. The model is analysed on two hypothetical data sets. The results for the smaller data set reveal that the inventory holding is a better alternative to capacity expansion to deal with fluctuations in market demand. However, for the bigger data set, capacity expansion is recommended to satisfy the increased demand instead of relying completely on inventory management. The results are further analysed for varying carbon price and it is observed that increase in carbon price initially causes an increase in the carbon emissions but later it starts decreasing. This indicates that the increase in carbon price does not provide quick results and is more effective in controlling the emissions in the longer run. Furthermore, the proposed model investigates how different trade policies viz. free trade agreement (FTA), FTA with cap, and an increase in tariff barriers influence the total carbon emissions and the total cost. The results indicate that the total cost and the total emissions are relatively less under FTA with cap, however, there is a slight increase in the emissions of one country.}

In this paper, we examine the role of promised-deliver-time (PDT) for the transport of vaccines in the imported vaccine provider’s agent selection: It can either rely on a non-competitive domestic agent (referred to as Pure Agent Marketing Strategy) or a rival domestic agent (referred to as Rival Agent Marketing Strategy) that produces and sells its self-branded vaccines. PDT is made by the logistics service provider (LSP), which helps keep the high quality of the imported vaccines but also significantly constrains the delivery volume. This further alters the imported vaccine provider’s agency marketing strategy. Interestingly, we find that the Rival Agent Marketing Strategy is not necessarily harmful for the imported vaccine provider, especially when the imported vaccine’s brand image advantage is significant and the PDT is long. We further study the impact of the brand substitutability and the imported vaccine provider’s social responsibility, finding that the main results are qualitatively unchanged.}

Countries worldwide rely on the COVID-19 vaccine to contain the spread of the pandemic. However, because of the inequality in distribution, people in many demographic groups and regions still do not have access to a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine.
Objective
To aid vaccine promotion campaigns that target populations with different access to the COVID-19 vaccine, this study examined how vaccine availability and vaccination intention influence people's consideration of the COVID-19 vaccine.
Method
We conducted a two-wave longitudinal survey and choice-based conjoint experiment to examine the influence of vaccine availability and vaccination intention on perceived barriers of vaccination (e.g., safety and cost concern) and preference in different vaccine features (e.g., FDA approval status and number of doses administered).
Result
We found that low availability and intention increased attention to global behavioral barriers such as safety concern and high-level vaccine attributes such as efficacy. In contrast, high availability articulates practical considerations such as cost and logistics associated with vaccination.
Conclusion
Based on such findings, we conclude that health communicators need to strategically customize their messages based on audience access to the COVID-19 vaccine and their intention to get vaccinated. Highlighting the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine may be more effective in low-accessibility and low-intention groups, while emphasis on practical considerations such as vaccine cost and logistics may be more effective in high-accessibility and high-intention groups.}

This study reviews the development of electric vehicle routing problem (EVRP) in transport logistics. The review found that few existing EVRP models considered integrally the unique characteristics of EVs, such as the nonlinear charging function, nonlinear electricity-consumption function, and dynamic driving ranges. This study develops a new comprehensive model of the EVRP that considers a general energy/electricity consumption function for EVs that factor in energy losses (aerodynamic, tire friction, drivetrain, ancillary, and kinetic/potential losses), nonlinear charging function with the piecewise linearization technique, efficient visits to charge stations, and continuous decision variables for speed, payload, travel time, recharging, etc. The newly developed model is much closer to reality by integrating most of the unique characteristics of EVs known so far, and therefore it advances the state-of-the-art in EVRP. Computational experiments on Solomon's instances were done to exhibit the effectiveness and efficiency of the developed model under the effects of air conditioner, battery capacity, and travel speed. These experiments demonstrated that the model can obtain more practical logistics plans for an EV fleet with a lower total emissions cost and higher energy utilization.}

Links are drawn between these models, PRSV characteristics and the need for scientific capabilities and transport logistics in polar science. An adapted model is then applied to the data collected, enabling the assessment of PRSV capabilities. The assessment is based on the following key characteristics: (1) icebreaking, (2) logistics, (3) science and (4) ship size, each using attributes from the database to provide a normalised score. Data pertaining to five PRSVs are examined and the results are depicted as a radar diagram. The results show the general applicability of the model.}

abstract = {In this study, we consider an integrated production and transportation scheduling problem faced by make-to-order manufacturers that adopt a commit-to-delivery business mode and cooperate with third-party logistics providers to deliver processed products to customers. The third-party logistics providers typically offer multiple shipping modes chosen by the manufacturers to deliver products, each shipping mode with a shipping time guarantee and a shipping cost function that is non-increasing in shipping time and sub-additive, non-decreasing in shipping quantity. The problem involves inventory holding costs which not only depend on the time that the products spend in temporary storage but also depend on customer types. The problem is to determine an integrated production and shipping schedule that satisfies the committed delivery due date limitations for the customers, such that the total cost of shipping and inventory holding is minimized. We investigate two cases with and without split delivery. For both cases, we first show that both of them are ordinarily NP-hard, prove that there exist no polynomial-time approximation algorithms with constant worst-case ratios, propose exact algorithms to solve them, and finally design column generation-based heuristic algorithms to find feasible solutions. The computational results demonstrate that the heuristic algorithms are capable of generating near-optimal solutions efficiently. We also consider two interesting practical variants of the problem.}

The investigated problem is concerned with the routing of a set of delivery vans equipped with a number of self-driving parcel delivery robots. To tackle the VRPTWDR, an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search heuristic algorithm is developed. Experiments show the performance and effectiveness of the algorithm for solving the VRPTWDR, and provide insights on the use of self-driving parcel delivery robots as an alternative last mile service.}

We then explore the possibility of accommodating historical information to design efficient online algorithms to serve online orders. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work on incorporating historical information to solve the online bipartite hyper-matching problem. Depending on whether orders can be partially served, we investigate two practical situations, i.e. separable and inseparable cases. For the inseparable case, we propose a randomized online algorithm, named Hyper-Matching, whose competitive ratio is a non-decreasing function of the amount of historical information. For the separable case, we modify Hyper-Matching to present another randomized online algorithm, named Separable-Hyper-Matching. It is worth noting that the competitive ratios of Hyper-Matching and Separable-Hyper-Matchingeither beat or match the current best online algorithms when no historical information is considered. We then present four computationally efficient heuristic algorithms, including a greedy variant and a batch-processing variant for each of the inseparable and separable cases. We perform a sequence of experiments using synthetic and real-world datasets, with an emphasis on the influence that historical information has on algorithm performance. The experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms and particularly the positive influence of historical information on our algorithms.}

abstract = {In this paper we address an optimization problem that arises in two- or three-echelon distribution network design whereby there is an interplay between the production and transfer schedule of semi-customizable products and their delivery under tight time windows. It is motivated by a real-world problem of optimizing the joint newspaper last-mile distribution network for SPDL (São Paulo Distribution and Logistics), a dedicated logistics provider established by the two major newspaper publishers in São Paulo, Brazil. Such collaborative logistics comprises servicing a very large number of customers in the urban setting of a large metropolitan area. The last-mile delivery is performed daily by a fleet comprising several hundreds of motorized vehicles (mainly motorcycles and light vans) that may originate either from a distribution center (that receives and consolidates different newspapers originating at the two printing sites for the delivery routes) or from informal transit points to where they are transferred, forming a multi-echelon delivery system. The resulting problem is complex not only due to its dimension but also as it involves three main types of decisions that should be taken simultaneously: the number and location of the distribution centers (DCs), the optimal synchronization of the transfer schedule of newspapers from the two printing sites to the selected DCs and the newspaper last-mile delivery. The main theoretical contribution of this work is a multi-stage solution approach whose core is a schedule-to-distribution model that allows integrating printing ramp-up constraints with the transfer shipment schedule and distribution routes. Together with a facility location model and a two-tier delivery districting, we could redesign the multi-echelon distribution operation in a more cost-efficient manner while ensuring the current service level to be maintained without service disruptions. This approach allowed us to obtain a new optimized network configuration and the corresponding delivery clusters with vehicle type choice as well as the optimal transfer schedule that yielded a significant cost reduction of nearly 18%.}

Food industry players have also become increasingly involved in these issues due to stakeholder pressures, and this highlights the importance in understanding what sustainability practices and best practices are being utilised. This review identifies the current state of knowledge of how food manufacturing companies implement sustainability in their operations and across their supply chains. A thematic analysis was conducted on 130 papers that were published over a 21-year time frame from 1999 to 2020 to identify eight key sustainability themes in the literature. These themes included – life cycle assessments, drivers, barriers and incentives to sustainability, waste and recycling management, food chain logistics, sustainability practices in small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), supplier management, partnerships and relationships and “other” sustainable supply chain management practices. Through examining the extant literature, it is clear that there remains substantial scope for research on the role of SMEs and food logistics, as there is scant research on both areas despite their critical role within sustainable supply chain management. It is also clear that large multinational companies have a critical role in supporting supply chain practices through not only driving practices but also in providing critical resources and collaboration for partners across the supply chain. Circular economy is emerging as a key research area that is experiencing increasing focus in recent years, although it is argued that future research should focus on digitisation efforts such as through Internet of Things and blockchain that has been highlighted as a major disruptive and supportive element in increasing sustainability across supply chains.}

A hybrid algorithm of the ant colony system and virtual transformation method (ACS-VTM) is then designed to explore the vehicle routing plan for the VRPSDPTI problem; it adopts a flexible split of the time period for re-optimisation and an improved partial service policy for customer demand. Based on it, a practical case of the VRPSDPTI problem is used to verify the proposed model and algorithm. One major finding is proposed through the study of the practical case that adopting the hybrid ACS-VTM algorithm can effectively reduce the total travel cycle for the VRPSDPTI problem. The main contributions of this study are that it can provide an efficient decision tool to solve the VRPSDPTI, and can not only reduce the total travel cycle, but also improve the efficiency of vehicle utilisation.}

abstract = {This study presents a novel approach to forecast freight rates in container shipping by integrating soft facts in the form of measures originating from surveys among practitioners asked about their sentiment, confidence or perception about present and future market development. As a base case, an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model was used and compared the results with multivariate modelling frameworks that could integrate exogenous variables, that is, ARIMAX and Vector Autoregressive (VAR). We find that incorporating the Logistics Confidence Index (LCI) provided by Transport Intelligence into the ARIMAX model improves forecast performance greatly. Hence, a sampling of sentiments, perceptions and/or confidence from a panel of practitioners active in the maritime shipping market contributes to an improved predictive power, even when compared to models that integrate hard facts in the sense of factual data collected by official statistical sources. While investigating the Far East to Northern Europe trade route only, we believe that the proposed approach of integrating such judgements by practitioners can improve forecast performance for other trade routes and shipping markets, too, and probably allows detection of market changes and/or economic development notably earlier than factual data available at that time.}

In these environments, even short-term machine or tool failure carry risks that can hardly be predicted, since single sites cannot usually continue to compensate incidents autonomously. This paper introduces a new optimization model for integrated machine scheduling with logistics planning at press-shop network level. The approach enables optimal capacity utilization for overcoming machine unavailability, and supports decision management for reconfiguring short-term production plans. Furthermore, the comprehensive integration of suppliers and subcontractors within the holistic concept is illustrated.}

abstract = {Intensive livestock production has a negative environmental impact by producing large amounts of animal dejections, which, if not properly managed, can contaminate nearby water bodies with nutrient excess. However, if the animal manure could be transferred efficiently to nearby crops and used as a fertilizer for the plants, pollution/contamination would be mitigated, transforming manure from a waste to a resource. This valorization of manure from waste to a resource falls within the circular economy principles, but the transportation of manure also comes at an environmental and economic cost. It is a single-objective optimization problem regarding finding the best solution for the logistics process of satisfying nutrient crops needs through livestock manure. This paper uses a centralized optimal algorithm (COA) to solve the problem, based on a realistic simulator that considers numerous real-world constraints that related work has not yet addressed. Implementation and evaluation of this method have been carried out based on extensive geolocalized data from Catalonia (Spain), one of the densest European farming regions, as a case study. The findings show that the use of treatment units in pig farms is not profitable, while applying treatment units on selected cow farms for composting manure has its merits, under an intelligent choice of cow farms. Finally, a comparison of our findings with those of two similar studies in Hangzhou, China and Minnesota, USA, are performed.}

Although the current literature regards the circular economy as a guide for more sustainable business models, it is not clear the main implications to key business areas. Therefore this study aimed to present the key impacts of circular economy practices within different business areas that help guide a sustainable management of businesses. To that end, it was identified, by means of a systematic review of the existing literature, the business areas impacted by circular economy practices within an organization. The business areas identified were strategic planning, cost management, supply chain management, quality management, environmental management, process management, logistics and reverse logistics, service management, and research and development, allowing a discussion on the main contributions of the circular economy to each area. A key-impact map was provided summarizing the most influential changes in each area that assist in the management of businesses towards greater sustainability. It is important that organizations understand and accurately internalize circularity principles within their strategic plan. On that note, adopting a circular thinking might enable an organization to obtain more sustainable (economic) results while reducing impacts.}

abstract = {There is a substantial body of literature relating to freight transport sector's economic impact at the macro-level, but less is known about how freight demand gets translated to an establishment's expenditures at the micro-level. This paper addresses this research gap by collecting data about expenditure patterns of establishments and applying market segmentation technique based on finite mixture models. Three latent segments - heavy spenders, medium spenders and light spenders – and their associated profiles are identified. The results indicate that significant differences exist between the three expenditure-based segments of establishments in terms of spending patterns, business size indicators, locational characteristics and freight travel patterns. The heavy spenders tend to be strongly influenced by employment, gross-floor area, business age and fleet ownership levels. The length of haul and truck type choice have a strong incremental effect on the volume of expenditures and larger shipment sizes are associated with expenditure reduction due to economies of scale. The diverging characteristics of expenditure segments emphasizes the need of the logistics providers to “identify their markets” and planners to “identify how demand translates to transport expenditures”. The overall conclusion is that segmenting establishments based on unobservable heterogeneity with respect to their freight transport expenditure is preferable and more informative than treating them as one homogeneous group. The study findings provide important information that planners and logistics providers can utilize in developing effective logistics plans and marketing strategies.}

Clinical development shows promising results and several candidates may be progressing to licensure in the coming years. This study aimed at exploring future acceptance and uptake of such regimens (also called heterologous prime-boost) and to identify implementation-associated benefits and challenges. Survey tools were developed based on findings from a previous literature search shared with the study team, and exploratory interviews with global stakeholders. An online survey and key informant interviews in six countries were conducted with stakeholders at national and sub-national level, including policy-makers, regulators and implementers. The interview guide and the online survey covered: (a) awareness of, and knowledge about, heterologous vaccine regimens; (b) rating of regimen-associated perceived benefits and challenges; (c) anticipation of possible challenges in relation to four hypothetical introduction scenarios; (d) potential acceptance benefits and challenges at the policy, health facility and recipient level. Sixty-two interviews were conducted at national level. The online survey was completed by 50 participants. Across the four introduction scenarios, respondents considered the highest potential for the introduction of heterologous regimens for immunoprophylaxis was among adolescents/adults for diseases against which no vaccines are currently available. Most reservations were related to logistics, record keeping, and recipient compliance. Adding a new heterologous vaccine regimen to the routine immunization calendar for children was considered feasible if it could generate an increased and longer-term immune response. Introduction in preparation of or following a disease outbreak was considered less favourably, with respondents stressing the difficulty of logistics in emergency situations, and the potential lag in the onset of protection. The recent approval of the first heterologous vaccine regimen for the prevention of Ebola Virus Disease will soon bring new light to the topic.}

In this chapter, the outputs of disaggregated national freight demand models (FDMs) are applied to identify opportunities to alleviate these challenges through targeted policy development and large-scale collaborative infrastructure investment planning. In the case of South Africa, key focus areas are the implementation of domestic intermodal solutions on the country’s two general freight corridors (Gauteng–Cape Town and Gauteng–Durban) to reduce logistics costs for domestic and international trade and the revitalization of rural branch lines to improve social and spatial equities. In India, the dedicated freight corridors initiative is a primary focus area, where the FDM outputs enable data-driven integrated planning between road, rail, ports, and inland waterways. This includes the creation of logistics hubs to facilitate seamless integration between modes, relieve inner-city congestion, and support hinterland development. The challenges that need to be overcome to attain full leverage of these outputs relate to the lack of trust between public and private logistics service providers to yield to collaborative solutions, exacerbated by political agendas. Continuous engagement is required, which is facilitated by the availability of impartial, interrogable data.}
