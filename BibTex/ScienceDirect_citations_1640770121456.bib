abstract = {CONTEXT
Given the need to expand food production to satisfy an increasing world population; regional land-use planners must direct this expansion to available, permitted areas (i.e., not legally protected forests) where production can be maximized and transportation costs, production costs and environmental impacts can be minimized. In this balancing act, the capabilities and layout of the current and future transport system are crucial in determining the spatial distribution of future agricultural production.
OBJECTIVE
The objective of the present study was to develop a modeling framework to determine the optimal spatial distribution of new soybean and corn production areas in Brazil and transport flows needed to move these commodities to maximize economic gains and limit or reduce negative environmental impacts.
METHODS
Initially, we applied Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to classify regions suitable for expanding soybean and corn production according to an area's potential for superior agricultural performance. Subsequently, we used a Network Equilibrium Model (NEM) to determine the best spatial distribution of new soybean and corn production areas so that their production added to existing production meets the estimated 2050 demand and the optimal configuration of existing and proposed transportation infrastructure required to move this production to appropriate locations.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
When compared to a 2018 baseline, the complete operation of planned railroads and the positioning of future grain production to occupy regions indicated by the modeling could increase soybean and corn production by 66% without simultaneous deforestation, reduce carbon dioxide emissions due to interregional soybean and corn transport by about 14%, and reduce combined transport and production costs by about 2%.
SIGNIFICANCE
The proposed modeling framework should be an extremely useful tool when determining sites for future agriculture production and the network matrix needed to transport this production, especially when considering the relationship between land use and transportation infrastructure.}

abstract = {In today’s logistical environment, companies must quickly deliver many kinds of products to customers, owing to intensifying competition, shortening product lifecycle. Mid-supply-chain logistical warehouses play an important role of adjusting the difference between manufacturer supply and customer demand. At the warehouses, most of the work comprises picking. Thus, it is imperative to make the picking process more efficient. The working time for picking is determined by a combination of elements, such as warehouse layout, storage assignment, order batching, and routing. And, adaptive storage assignments to change of demand have been effective. In practice, if the storage assignment changes, the picker will have a learning curve negatively affecting picking time. A model handling such effects has already been proposed. However, it is assumed all of the picker learning is reset. This is impractical. Our study proposes a new model in which the picker only relearns the shelf for which a storage assignment has been changed. Furthermore, pickers’ learning grows with the number of storage-shelf accesses, the degree of picker’s learning affect the probability of picking errors and search time. Our study specifies the effectiveness of the storage-shelf learning method for handling adaptive storage assignments.}

abstract = {City users gladly apply comfortable and time-saving e-commerce solutions as an alternative to traditional purchase. The present pandemic crisis made this issue even more important. It significantly increased the number of transport operations within the city area, as each order has to be delivered directly to the purchaser. Consequently, city authorities are confronted with the important challenge: how to fulfil the expectations and needs of city users in the context of transport system functioning in view of reducing the negative impacts of urban freight transport in terms of safety, air pollution or noise. This is one of the most important elements of social sustainability in cities. One of the solutions that help reduce the negative environmental impacts of urban freight transport is making use of vehicles that produce less air pollution, such as electric vans. It proved to be very effective in decreasing transportation footprint by reducing local emissions of e.g. PM or NOx. However, one of the key limitations is the potential short driving range of such vehicles, which results from the battery capacity and charging infrastructure availability. In recent years, some analyses related to that issue have been made. Nevertheless, the studies have taken into account passenger cars only. This paper presents the results of the research study aimed at verification of electric vans energy efficiency in real-life conditions, i.e. when delivering courier consignments. The electric van used for the purposes of the experiment was Nissan eNV200. This paper fulfils the important knowledge gap and could be helpful from both theoretical and practical perspectives. It should be emphasised that the experiment was carried out in real-life conditions, i.e. in the course of performing business processes in one of the worldwide known CEP companies. The research study was carried out under the EUFAL international project, funded under the Electric Mobility Europe programme. The results of the research shown high potential of electric vehicles and usefulness of electromobility in last mile deliveries. The business partner of the research is now on the stage of electric freight vehicles implementation into vehicles fleets.}

These characteristics undoubtedly put significant strain to the human worker (picker) creating both body fatigue and feelings of monotony and dissatisfaction usually leading to employee underperformance and demotivation. In this paper, we conducted a questionnaire-based survey to supervisors and pickers from different large distribution centers to evaluate the individuals' acceptance of introducing Augmented Reality (AR) in the picking process to support pickers in their everyday tasks, gamification elements as a tool for increasing their motivation and last but not least, a combination of the two approaches.}

This study aims to evaluate the economic and environmental performance of alternative fuels in Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), through measurement and quantification of potential adverse effects of the emitted pollutants on human health and ecosystem quality. Accounting for fuel emissions, especially pollutants of concern (i.e., NOx, HC and CO) and GHG emissions (i.e., CO2, N2O) during production, distribution, and combustion phases, several mixed-integer programming models have been developed based on Well-to-Wheel and Tank-to-Wheel analysis. Aside from factors such as distance, load and speed, the proposed models incorporate the transmission gear ratio as a major factor affecting vehicle mileage and emissions. Several numerical tests were conducted to examine the effects on fuel type and gear selection on fuel consumption and pollutant intensity. The results show that though pure biodiesel combustion emissions have the same negative impact on environmental quality, further analysis, taking into account the whole fuel chain activities leading to produce and consuming the product, demonstrate 37% reduction in GHG emissions compared to conventional diesel based on equivalent carbon dioxide measure.}

The formulation is shown to significantly increase in computational complexity as the number of demand sites increases, and therefore an efficient heuristic algorithm is presented to solve large-size problems.

There are shortcomings such as the incomplete comprehensive supporting system, lacking of logistics technology and low effective infrastructure in cold chain logistics. Scientific and optimal selection of distribution mode is crucial to the operation of fresh e-commerce and urban circulation efficiency. Owing to the problem that urban logistics distribution limits the cold chain logistics of fresh agricultural products, we propose the distribution mode and synergistic mechanism of cold chain logistics of urban fresh agricultural products. By leveraging the theory of logistics and supply chain management, we explore the high logistics cost of fresh e-commerce, inconsistent cold chain logistics standards, and poor consumer viscosity. We introduce the self-established logistics, third-party logistics, self-established logistics, third-party logistics and other three main logistics distribution modes. Due to the impact of cold chain logistics distribution on the existing urban transportation, an integrated mode of self-established logistics/third-party logistics + joint distribution is designed. In order to promote the collaborative development of cold chain logistics distribution and fresh electricity, it is significant to establish three collaborative mechanisms from the perspective of government, enterprises and third-party logistics According to the green logistics, the carbon tax cost and cargo damage cost in the process of cold chain logistics distribution are discovered by a graphical model. The graphical model is constructed under the optimization objective of minimizing each cost. In order to avoid the problem that basic artificial fish swarm algorithm is prone to local optimum, a global artificial fish swarm algorithm is designed and solved. Extensive experimental results have shown the usefulness and effectiveness of our proposed method.}

These elements have been subject to a significant supply uncertainty. A promising strategy to alleviate supply risk is value recovery from end-of-life (EOL) products. This paper proposes a reverse supply network to optimize: 1) the locations and capacities of dismantling and recycling facilities, and 2) the transportation flows between collection centers, dismantling facilities, recycling facilities, and sales points. Two objectives are considered: maximizing profit and environmental benefits. A Pareto front is created that shows non-dominated optimal solutions. When the model was applied to the United States, California was found to be the most important state for EOL product collection, representing up to 22% of the total collection volume. Nevada, Tennessee, and Delaware were the key states for EOL product dismantling, and Nevada, Texas, and Delaware were the key states for NdFeB magnet recycling. A sensitivity analysis was performed to measure the impact of different NdFeB magnet price on the overall network design. While REE recovery is still at an early stage of the development, this research serves as a blueprint for constructing a profitable and environmentally friendly NdFeB magnet reverse supply chain.}

In this modelling approach, the network design decisions are integrated with the multi-period response operational decisions where the number of casualties with different levels of injuries coming from the affected areas is uncertain. Furthermore, the transportation capacity for the evacuation of casualties to CCPs and hospitals is also uncertain. To solve this complex problem, a robust sample average approximation method with the feasibility restoration technique is proposed, and its efficiency is examined through a statistical validation procedure. We then evaluate the proposed methodology in the backdrop of a hypothetical case of Bhopal gas tragedy (with the same hazard propagation profile) at the present day. We also report the solution robustness and model robustness of 144 instances of the case-study to show the proficiency of our proposed solution approach. Results analysis reveals that our modelling approach enables the decision makers to design a humanitarian logistic network in which not only the proximity and accessibility to CCPs are improved, but also the number of lives lost is decreased. Moreover, it is shown that the proposed robust stochastic optimization approach converges rapidly and more efficiently. We hope that our methodology will encourage urban city planners to pre-identify CCP locations, and, in the event of a disaster, help them decide on the subset of these CCPs that could be rapidly mobilised for disaster response.}

Hybrid AM enables Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) who can offer post-processing services to integrate into the growing AM supply chain. Most near-net metal AM parts require heat treatment processes (e.g. residual stress relieving/annealing) before machining to achieve final engineering specification. This research investigates a two-stage facility model to optimize the locations and capacities for new metal AM hubs which require two sequential post-processing services: heat treatment and machining. Using North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) data for machine shops and heat treatment facilities in the U.S., a p-median location model is used to determine the optimal locations for AM hub centers based on: (1) geographical data, (2) demand and (3) fixed and operational costs of hybrid-AM processing. Results from this study have identified: (a) candidate US counties to locate metal AM hubs, (b) total cost (fixed, operational and transportation), (c) capacity utilization of the AM hubs and (d) demand assignments across machine shops – heat treatment facilities – AM hubs. It was found that 2-stage p-Median model identified 22 A M hub locations as the initial sites for AM hubs which grows to 35 A M hubs as demand increases. It was also found that relatively fewer number of heat treatment facilities than machine shops resulted in a more concentrated locations of AM hubs. In addition, transportation costs were not adversely affected by the inclusion of as-build plates and showed that including heat treatment facilities as part of the hybrid AM supply chain will be mutually beneficial to all stakeholders of metal hybrid AM supply chain, i.e. AM → Heat treatment → Machining.}

One way to improve urban delivery operations is to use public transport capacity to move goods to intermediate transfer locations from which they can be delivered by (small) vehicles to the final customers. We study the distance savings that can be achieved by such a two-tier urban delivery system. In particular, we focus on determining which transit stop is best located to be used as a transfer location. We present several special cases to get insights into the transfer location decisions. Moreover, we present a mixed-integer linear programming formulation and a heuristic to solve it. To evaluate the different approaches, we run several computational studies. We also perform a sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of different system parameters on the location decisions and system performance. For very conservative benchmarks, the results show that savings up to 7.1 percent are possible from using public transport capacity to support urban delivery. The savings increase with the distance to the depot, tighter deadlines and customers that are clustered around the transit line.}

Hence, there is an urgent need for a new generation of computational theories and tools to assist humans in extracting useful information from the rapidly growing volumes of digital data. A well-known fundamental task of data mining to extract information is clustering. However, with the modified applications for various domains, several researchers have developed and have provided many clustering algorithms. This complexity makes it difficult for researchers and practitioners to keep up with clustering algorithms development. As a result, finding appropriate algorithms helps significantly to organize information and extract the correct answer from different queries of the databases. In this respect, the aim of this paper is to find the appropriate clustering algorithm for sparse industrial dataset. To achieve this goal, we first present related work that focus on comparing different clustering algorithms over the past twenty years. After that, we provide a categorization of different clustering algorithms found in the literature by matching their properties to the 4V’s challenges of Big data which allow us to select the candidate clustering algorithm. Finally, using internal validity indices, K-means, agglomerative hierarchical, DBSCAN and SOM have been implemented and compared on four datasets. In addition, we highlighted the best performing clustering algorithm that gives us the efficient clusters for each dataset.}

According to some experts, herd immunity for COVID-19 can be achieved by inoculating 67% of the population. India may find it difficult to achieve this service level target, owing to several infrastructural deficiencies in its vaccine supply chain. Effect of these deficiencies is to cause frequent lead time disruptions. In this context, we develop a novel modelling approach to identify few nodes, which require additional inventory allocations (strategic inventory reserves) to ensure minimum service level (67%) under the possibility of lead time disruptions. Later, through an illustrative case study on distribution of Japanese Encephalitis vaccine, we identify conditions under which strategic inventory reserve policy cannot be practically implemented to meet service level targets. Nodes fulfilling these conditions are termed as critical nodes and must be overhauled structurally to make the implementation of strategic inventory policy practically viable again. Structural overhauling may entail installation of better cold storage facilities, purchasing more quality transport vans, improving reliability of transport network, and skills of cold storage manager by training. Ideally, conditions for identifying critical nodes for COVID-19 vaccine distribution must be derived separately by substituting COVID-19 specific parametric values in our model. In the absence of the required data for COVID-19 scenario, JE specific criteria can be used heuristically to identify critical nodes and structurally overhaul them later for efficiently achieving service level targets.}

In the collaborative network, the customer demand splitting scheme based on customer clustering aims to achieve the balance of demands’ spatial distribution and improve the efficiency of logistics transportation. The multi-depot pickup and delivery vehicle routing problem focuses on establishing a collaborative network optimization model to coordinate the pickup and delivery services among multiple depots and determine the optimal routes with reduced operating cost through logistics resource sharing. A 3D customer clustering algorithm with split load strategies is developed to reassign each customer to its favorable service provider considering multiple customer service characteristics. A hybrid genetic algorithm with tabu search is designed to optimize the pickup and delivery routes and maximize the logistics resource utilization. A realistic logistics network in Chongqing, China is used to test the performance of the proposed solution methods for the CMDPDLN optimization. Computational results show the effectiveness of customer clustering and demand splitting in simplifying and improving the large-scale collaborative network, and the adaptability of the hybrid algorithm in finding the minimal-cost vehicle routes. Therefore, the collaboration and demand split strategy adopted in network optimization can provide a reference for logistics operational management and facilitate sustainable pickup and delivery networks.}

Besides that, we give a rule-based method to estimate the number of relocation moves in a bay. The local search heuristic produces solutions that are close to the optimal solution. Finally, for instances in which the benefits of moving containers in the two different phases are in balance, the solution of the heuristic yields significant improvement compared to the existing methods in which containers are only moved in one of the two phases.}

In this era of climate change concerns and political discord, a more holistic approach to biorefinery siting may yield alternative locations that meet stakeholder goals for community acceptance and reduced environmental impacts. A multi-criteria decision support tool (DST) that incorporates economic, environmental, and social metrics concurrently is introduced to assess the repurpose potential of existing facilities as a wood-based biorefinery. Economic siting criteria are represented by biorefinery operational cost components that vary geospatially. The environmental criterion is the Global Warming Potential of the supply chain, as measured through greenhouse gases emitted from the feedstock procurement, preprocessing, and transport equipment. Social criteria are represented by 1) the number of regional jobs created through the installation of a biofuel supply chain, and 2) county-level social assets that may influence biorefinery project success. Weights and scale values are derived for each set of metrics. An overall facility score is produced by summing the three metric scores. Additionally, overall user-defined metric weights are used to adjust the importance of the three metrics, thus altering the overall facility scores. The DST is applied to a case study in Western Oregon and Western Washington to refine a list of candidate pulp mills down to a select few for further investigation. It was found that the mills scored differently when overall metric weights were adjusted. Therefore, different stakeholder preferences may yield a different priority list of facilities.}

abstract = {This paper considers the Quay Crane Scheduling Problem (QCSP) with non-crossing and safety clearance constraints for a single vessel. The problem determines the order of unloading and loading operations that a specific number of quay cranes (QCs) perform to serve a vessel in minimum time. The QCs move on a single rail and therefore cannot cross each other, and every two consecutive cranes must leave a specific safety distance between them. Due to the difficulty of this problem, most researchers have used heuristics to solve it. However, the QCSP is normally used as a building block of bigger ports’ optimization problems that are very difficult to solve without some decomposition techniques like Lagrangian relaxation. For these methods to succeed, the sub-problems must be solved to optimality in reasonable computational time. This paper presents an improvement on a recent novel formulation for the problem, followed by a new exact and computationally fast technique to solve it. The technique is a two-step approach initiated by a partitioning heuristic and terminated by a Branch and Price algorithm. Through computational experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed solution approach can solve real-sized cases in a fast computational time and has low sensitivity to all parameters. Finally, we introduce a method, formulated as a traveling salesman problem, to acquire operationally practical solutions by minimizing crane re-positioning movements and accounting for crane initial positions.}

For the second formulation, we first devise a task adjacency graph, that we use to develop a path-based integer linear program. We then propose a column generation framework to solve large-scale instances. Finally, we perform numerical experiments to compare the performance of the two models. Our computational results show that the path-based formulation solved using our proposed column generation framework outperforms the arc-based mixed integer linear program in solution time, without sacrificing solution quality.}

Central to the efficacy of the proposed B&P algorithm is the development of a specialized dynamic programming procedure that extends works on elementary shortest path problems with resource constraints in order to solve the more complex column generation pricing subproblem. Our computational study demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed approach using a set of 60 problem instances. Moreover, the proposed methodology has the merit of providing optimal solutions in run times that are significantly shorter than those reported for decomposition-based heuristics in the literature.}

Robots bring movable shelves, called pods, to workstations where inventory is put on or removed from the pods. This paper simulates both the pick and replenishment process and studies the order assignment, pod selection and pod storage assignment problems by evaluating multiple decision rules per problem. The discrete event simulation uses realistic robot movements and keeps track of every unit of inventory on every pod. We analyze seven performance measures, e.g. throughput capacity and order due time, and find that the unit throughput is strongly correlated with the other performance measures. We vary the number of robots, the number of pick stations, the number of SKUs (stock keeping units), the order size and whether returns need processing or not. The decision rules for pick order assignment have a strong impact on the unit throughput rate. This is not the case for replenishment order assignment, pod selection and pod storage. Furthermore, for warehouses with a large number of SKUs, more robots are needed for a high unit throughput rate, even if the number of pods and the dimensions of the storage area remain the same. Lastly, processing return orders only affects the unit throughput rate for warehouse with a large number of SKUs and large pick orders.}

Under the European Union (EU) Battery Directive, EV manufacturers are classified as battery producers and are responsible for the collection, treatment and recycling of waste or damaged vehicle batteries. The European agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (ADR) stipulates that damaged or defective LIB packs must be transported in approved explosion proof steel containers. This necessitates costly testing in order to meet ADR requirements. Furthermore, the extra size and weight of this packaging adds further prohibitive expense to the transportation of damaged or defective LIB. In this study, cryogenically frozen cells are shown to be unable to release any energy even in extreme abuse conditions. This is demonstrated on two different cell chemistries and form factors. Experiments have shown that the possibility of thermal runaway is completely removed and therefore it is argued that LIBs may be transported safely whilst cryogenically frozen. Moreover, flash freezing is shown to have little effect on the electrical performance (energy capacity and impedance) even after five repetitive cryogenic cycles. Thus, facilitating the potential reuse and remanufacture of individual LIB cells from a complete damaged pack, prolonging the useful life, reducing the consumption of raw materials, and improving environmental sustainability of EV introduction.}

One area that is traditionally reliant on human operators and optimization is the trucking industry. In recent years, this industry has started to explore how the above-mentioned technologies can be utilized to improve their operations, and new policies are further amplifying this process, e.g., by mandating Electronic Logging Device (ELD) to be used by commercial drivers in the USA. This development forces companies to collect digital, high-resolution data – and the question emerges how to utilize this data in the most value-adding way. In this paper, we analyze the current state of the art of digital transformation in the trucking industry by conducting a bibliometric study of recently published papers to identify the main research areas and themes in this field, the leading authors, countries, and journals in this domain.

The model allows for the purchasing of the relief items, both locally and nonlocally, includes a budget constraint for each humanitarian organization, along with imposed lower and upper bound demand constraints at each point of demand by a higher level organization. The governing concept is that of Generalized Nash Equilibrium, since not only does the utility function of a given humanitarian organization depend on its own strategies and the strategies of the other humanitarian organizations, but the constraints do as well. The concept of a variational equilibrium is utilized to derive the variational inequality formulation of the governing equilibrium conditions and the model is analyzed qualitatively. Lagrange analysis of the marginal utilities is conducted to gain insights on the impact of the constraints and an alternative variational inequality constructed, with nice features for computations. An algorithm is proposed and explicit formulae provided for the logistical flows and Lagrange multipliers at each iteration. Numerical examples, inspired by Hurricane Harvey hitting Houston, Texas, as occurred in August 2017, illustrate the framework. This work adds to the still nascent literature on game theory and disaster relief and also to the literature on variational inequality models with nonlinear constraints, which is limited.}

abstract = {The last mile of freight distribution is a critical part of the supply chain because of its significant costs and customers’ increasing expectations from e-commerce and same-day delivery services. Automated technologies in freight transportation represent an opportunity to develop more efficient systems characterized by the integration of different and complementary modes. In this study, we focus on the possibility of implementing an integrated truck-robot system for the last-mile delivery. This typology of problem shares similarities with truck-drone problems, although robots are characterized by much slower speeds and can perform several consecutive deliveries. Based on these particular features, a heuristic that efficiently identifies solutions based on initial truck tours and corresponding joint robot operations is presented. This solution approach leverages a special version of the “Weighted Interval Scheduling Problem,” which allows for a very efficient Dynamic Programming solution. The developed solution approach is adopted to analyze the influence on efficiency of different features concerning the robot’s design and operation, and the surrounding environment. The results show that robot-assisted last-mile delivery systems are quite efficient if robots are employed in heavily congested areas and appropriately retrofitted to accommodate several compartments in the robot’s storage.}

The GVRP is developed as a multi-objective mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model that incorporates a fuel consumption calculation algorithm. The proposed model considers the vehicle load and capacity as well as time-varying speed in order to account for traffic congestion. An improved non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) with adaptive strategies and greedy strategies is developed to solve the GVRP. The results of numerical experiments show that the consumption of fuel in a supply chain can be decreased sharply without any significant loss in customer satisfaction. The proposed NSGA-II has a better capability and efficiency than the original NSGA-II. Our experiments also indicate that the proposed model outperforms most of the best-known solutions obtained from the traditional modeling approaches.}

The proposed auction framework consists of announcement, construction, and evaluation phases. In the announcement phase, the relief organization provides suppliers with information about demand and required relief items. In the construction phase, a fuzzy bi-objective mathematical model is developed from a supplier’s perspective; by solving the model, the suppliers offer their bids, each of which stipulating price, quantity, and delivery time for each item. The evaluation phase is formulated from the relief organization’s perspective; suppliers are first ranked based on their proposed bids and other qualitative criteria by the fuzzy PROMETHEE method. Then, a fuzzy tri-objective mathematical model is solved to determine winner(s) and allocate orders. For the first time, this paper develops a multi-objective robust possibilistic programming (MORPP) approach to cope with the uncertainty of parameters in the relief chain. Furthermore, multi-objective models are solved by an augmented ∊-constraint method.

The pickup velocity of lump coal particles were determined by the weight loss method and observed by a high speed camera. The results show that the pickup mechanism, the pickup process, and the variation in the weight loss curve of the lump coal particle are similar to the results of Geldart D particles and Geldart B particles. Notably, two observations are worth highlighting: (1) the pickup of lump coal particles is determined by the critical motion, namely, initial shaking and rolling, which are mainly affected by the disturbance of airflow, the disturbance of particle impact, and the disturbance of unstable-support; and (2) the K & R model has a favorable adaptability to large lump coal particles, and an exponential equation, based on the foundation of the K & R model and taking the dimensionless particle size into account, is employed to predict the pickup velocity of lump coal particles. The prediction deviations agree well with the experimental results.}

Distribution and collection of agricultural crops can be challenging duties as world demand and production are substantially increased. Accordingly, resource depletion, environmental concern, and the importance of the circular economy have convinced this research group to focus on a Closed-Loop Supply Chain (CLSC) network design. In this study, a new mixed linear mathematical model for a CLSC was developed which minimizes the CLSC’s total costs and which tackles and controls air pollution. Contrary to previous works about supply chain network design, we firstly consider citrus fruits’ crates in our model. To solve the model, two leading algorithms, Genetic Algorithm and Simulated Annealing, are employed and a third recently successful method, Keshtel Algorithm, is utilized. Further, two hybridization algorithms stemmed from mentioned ones are applied. Finally, the results are assessed by different criteria and compared, and then the two best algorithms are chosen in this case. Consequently, in order to achieve the most effective result, a real case study of crates was conducted. The results obviously presented applicability and efficiency of the proposed model. Thus, the most suitable network for CLSC of citrus fruits’ crates was designed in which the costs and emissions were reduced.}

The objective is to minimise the total transportation and holding costs. We formulate the problem as a mixed integer linear program and solve it by means of an adaptive large neighbourhood search metaheuristic in combination with the solution of a reduced formulation.

More recently, its growth has been substantial and 2020 witnessed a huge increase due to COVID-19-related mobility restrictions. In principle, e-grocery could reduce the number of shopping trips, yet an exponential increase in shipping and deliveries could have a negative impact on the environment. In order to explore the willingness to e-grocery, and delivery preferences (self-delivery, home delivered grocery or collected in a specific place) - and estimate their market shares - a stated preference survey was carried in Rome and Milan. Respondents were asked about their grocery shopping habits and to choose among different shopping and delivery options. Discrete choice modelling allows investigating preference heterogeneity and estimating willingness to pay measures. Main results indicate that respondents, characterised by distinct socio-economic, attitudinal, and geographical elements, react differently to attribute variations for alternative grocery shopping channels. Scenario simulations can help in defining successful business-strategies and possible solutions to external costs. Under this respect, results suggest that the best strategy to increase e-grocery shares in the two cities should be non-monetary, but rather aimed at expanding the product range available online.}

TOPTW-TDS builds a set of paths to maximize the collected scores. The score of visiting an attraction is different depending on the time of visit. A mathematical formulation is proposed for this new problem. Since the problem is NP-hard, a hybrid artificial bee colony (HABC) algorithm is proposed to find the optimal solutions for small instances and near-optimal solutions for larger instances. Three datasets (small, medium and large) are generated with 168 TOPTW-TDS instances. Computational results reveal that the proposed HABC algorithm can generate high-quality TOPTW-TDS solutions. The proposed HABC obtains the optimal solution of each small TOPTW-TDS instance. For medium and large TOPTW-TDS instances, HABC results are comparable with the SA results. Additionally, results from solving TOPTW benchmark instances indicate that the proposed HABC compares well with the state-of-the-art algorithms for TOPTW.}

A limited number of engineers are employed while also stocks of the various spare parts are limited. In case any resource (engineer or spare part) is not immediately available, the service provider may follow a full backlogging policy. Alternatively, in case of spare parts stock out, he has the option to revert to an emergency supplier with ample capacity of resources. We present an original model to analyze the problem dynamics between this service provider and the emergency supplier. Especially, we determine the optimal emergency shipment cost and the optimal multi-resource level of the service provider. To this end, we propose a computationally efficient algorithm to find the Stackelberg equilibrium. Furthermore, we design a revenue-sharing cooperative contract between these players which always results in coordination. Finally, we examine the risk of uncertainties in such a contract and find the optimal contract parameters by considering the utility functions of the players.}

abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the contract design in a multi-resource service supply chain between a first line service provider and an emergency supplier under information asymmetry. The service provider is contractually responsible for the timely repair of the assets that fail, under a given service level agreement with the asset owner. To execute a repair, the service provider needs both engineers and spare parts to replace malfunctioning parts. In case of a spare parts stock out, the service provider can either wait for the regular replenishment of parts from the central depot or decide to hand over the entire call to an emergency supplier. For the latter case, a contract between the service provider and the supplier is necessary that specifies how the emergency supplier is compensated by the service provider. Particularly, we investigate what is the best contract the supplier can offer when information on asset reliability only resides with the service provider but remains hidden for the emergency supplier (information asymmetry). In the first type of contracts, the supplier charges the service provider a price, specified in a so-called price-only contract, for each time he takes over a call. As an alternative, we study the so-called revenue-sharing contracts in which the supplier receives a fraction of the service provider’s annual revenue and in return agrees to charge a lower price per call. In addition to the standard (single) revenue-sharing contract, we study the implementation of a menu of revenue-sharing contracts. We show that finding a menu of revenue-sharing contracts is not always possible and, if possible, does not necessarily give a higher profit to the supplier than a single revenue-sharing contract. In an extensive numerical experiment, we show that the combination of the single and the menu of revenue-sharing contracts results in, on average, less than 5% loss of the supplier profit under perfect (symmetric) information. Additionally, we find that, while having private information on the assets’ failure rates increases the service provider profit, the increase is insignificant, resulting in an additional profit of only 0.06% on average. Finally, we observe that the supplier can increase his profit, on average, up to 14% if he incites the LSP by means of a side-payment mechanism to share his private information.}

Sensor data (features) and activity data (target values) are used for data acquisition. Data preprocessing is performed using the moving average method to suppress data noise; data outliers are filtered using the box method. Feature selection is based on statistical considerations and the SHAP values. A total of five supervised machine learning algorithms are used to classify the existing data: (1) Decision Tree, (2) Logistic Regression, (3) Support Vector Machine, (4) Naive Bayes, (5) Artificial Neural Networks.

They show the impact of using full stochastic information instead of using mean values in a deterministic setting. The proactive/reactive approach, based on iterated tabu search and stochastic dynamic programming, provides good results when uncertainties on arrival times remain limited, while requiring only a few minutes of computing time on average. For larger levels of uncertainty, the proposed pure reactive approach clearly outperforms the others.}

Otherwise, failed parts are backordered and fulfilled when a spare of the same type becomes available (repaired). The repair servers are heterogeneous and can process certain types of repairables only if they have the necessary skill. In this system, in contrast with the other skill-optimization models, there is a trade-off between adding extra skills to servers (training) or adding extra inventory. In this paper, we formulate a mathematical model to optimize the assignment of skills to servers taking into account inventories for the ready-to-use spares and backorder costs (penalties). To optimize the skill assignments and inventories, we use a hybrid approach combining a Genetic Algorithm (GA) with simulation modeling. The proposed simulation-based optimization heuristic is used for extensive analysis of optimal skill assignments where we show that partial flexibility for repair servers with limited cross-training will lead to lower total system cost.}

This paper presents a mathematical model to schedule these operations. The need for redistribution stems from having surplus inventories in some locations and severe shortages in other areas, as new information on the losses becomes available. The proposed model represents a particular inventory routing problem, which includes a vehicle routing problem with pickup and delivery in the first period, and a network flow problem for each of the following periods. As a result, it can produce itineraries and loading plans for the fleet in each period when it is solved in a rolling horizon manner. The objective function is to minimize the sum of deprivation costs, operating costs, and costs of breaching the previous decisions. The fairness in the distribution of relief goods is embedded in the model. The distinction between the characteristics of relief goods further complicates the model. Due to the difficulty of solving the routing problems, a specialized simulated annealing algorithm with a novel solution encoding is developed. In each iteration of the proposed algorithm, the routing decisions are made using the simulated annealing algorithm. Then, the resulting subproblem is solved using CPLEX to evaluate the objective function. Parameter tuning of the algorithm is done in a systematic fashion. Finally, the proposed model and solution algorithm has been tested on a set of randomly generated problems and two instances of a real-world case study. Analysis of the numerical results shows that the proposed algorithm can produce high-quality solutions in a reasonable time. It is shown that redistribution can significantly improve the performance of the relief operation.}

abstract = {In the inventory management of automated teller machines (ATMs) many activities affect the total costs, such as forecasting, replenishments and the denomination mix used. The denomination mix is the combination of bills used to fulfill a customer’s demand. We investigate whether allowing the denomination mix to vary over time based on the forecast withdrawals at an ATM reduces actual operating costs of an ATM. To verify this, we propose a time-varying denomination mix strategy, which is validated by benchmarking it against the case of a bank’s denomination mix strategy. The bank’s predetermined strategy typically consists of a least note strategy or a one-smallest strategy. In all strategies we simultaneously optimize denomination mixes and replenishment decisions. We define the problem and solution strategies as mixed integer programming formulations and solve them via a rolling horizon algorithm using different frequencies of denomination mix updates, rolling horizon lengths, numbers of ATMs, cost parameters, and forecast qualities. By implementing the time-varying denomination mix, we show that the operational costs of managing an ATM can be reduced by 21% or €153.77 per ATM per month on average, which can represent over €10 million per year in the Netherlands only.}

abstract = {This paper presents an optimisation formulation for consolidated planning of railway hump yard operations. The objective is to minimise the average dwell time of railway cars in the yard, while satisfying constraints related to (i) incoming (outgoing) train arrival (departure) times and composition, (ii) car movement sequencing, and (iii) the limited capacity and number of classification tracks. We present a mixed-integer linear programming formulation that combines three stages of decision making; inbound train humping, railcar classification and outbound train construction. The consolidated approach enables a natural linking between capacity constraints at various stages of the system. However, the scale and complexity of the resulting problem requires some relaxation, with the optimisation model providing a high-level plan, and a low-level heuristic handling the detailed implementation. The high-level optimiser determines hump schedule of the inbound trains, block-to-classification track assignment, and pull-out schedule at coarse level by dividing the planning horizon into discrete time intervals and trains into groups of consecutive cars (segments). The low-level heuristic converts the resulting instructions into fine-grained decisions spatially (at the individual car level) and temporally (the actual duration required for each action). The proposed approach is implemented on a rolling horizon basis, and is used to solve a 42-day, 52246-car example.}

Considering that the real weights of goods to be recycled from the customers are fixed but cannot be precisely given while making one-time routing scheme in the daily operations, the pickup demands are considered as fuzzy numbers, and accordingly a fuzzy chance-constraint programming model for obtaining a prior route solution from the perspective of risk is presented. Afterwards, by demonstrating the continuity and monotonicity of the objective functions, a two-phase approach based on the operational law of the inverse credibility distribution is introduced to solve the model, including translating it into an equivalent nonlinear programming model and resorting to the existing algorithms for obtaining optimal solutions afterwards. Subsequently, in order to validate the performance of the proposed approach and in consideration of the inherent complexity of the vehicle routing problem, a two-phase-based genetic algorithm and the conventional fuzzy simulation-based genetic algorithm are designed and compared by a clothes delivery and pickup problem. The computational results demonstrate that the proposed solution framework is competitive in effectiveness and efficiency, and the parameter analyses provide some suggestions for guidance.}

We propose a model in this study to find an effective toll charging scheme to minimize total network vehicular emissions while maintaining reasonable revenue for investors. A bi-level modeling approach is used, where toll prices for multi-class vehicles are decided in the upper level and user response to toll charges are predicted using user equilibrium conditions with multi-class traffic assignment in the lower level. The model takes into consideration both toll revenue and total vehicle operating costs to produce an acceptable solution for both investors and road users. All major components of hazardous emissions were considered and estimated using secondary data, quantifying their impact on human health and the environment. The application of the model was illustrated using two networks considering different toll charging scenarios and near-optimal solutions were found for each toll-charging scenario. The results revealed that commonly used toll schemes are inefficient with respect to multi-stakeholder objectives. The optimized toll charging scheme was able to reduce the total emission costs of the network by 12 % compared to the toll scheme currently used by a toll facility in a real network in Melbourne, Australia.}

The multiple steps in the medicine delivery process impact the efficiency and increase the risk of contamination. Many hospitals are therefore on their way to automate this process. The Telelift-based automated medicine delivery system provides high health safety, low operational cost, and high system efficiency. This paper develops a stochastic model to evaluate and analyze the medicine delivery process by such an automated medicine delivery system. We adopt a two-moment approximation method and an aggregation approximation algorithm to solve the nested queuing model, considering regular and peak demand. We use simulation to validate the analytical model. The numerical experiments show that our analytical model is sufficiently accurate to evaluate the automated medicine delivery process. Our model can help decision makers of hospitals to reduce the patient waiting time and medicine response time. Our method can also be extended to other automated overhead material handling systems.}

abstract = {The current trend towards mass customization confronts established mass production systems with specific challenges. In future production layouts will have to provide a high degree of flexibility and changeability in order to be able to respond to the demand for individualized mass products. This leads to a production network in which the work schedule of each product and thus the sequence of the individual production resources are flexibly arranged. A challenge in this scenario is the implementation of material transport between the machines. The use of mobile transport robots to realize a flexible connection of all material sources and sinks proves to be effective. However, the current design forms, as a monolithic AGV system or the use of flexible autonomous units, show specific weaknesses. The paper describes the research approach to establish an intralogistics service-based software architecture as an intralogistics execution system, which contains the elementary functions of a cross-platform use of mobile autonomous systems. One key application is to digitize the workspace of the mobile systems with a distributed system of infrastructural sensors. An embedded unit separates the scenario into static and dynamic obstacles. The method discussed also includes the aggregation of the images with static obstacles to a world model as a basis for global cross-platform routing. Thus, it is possible to include the static obstacles in an early phase of path planning. The researched architecture integrates a routing service, which offers a cross-platform map for each type of transport robots in use. The dynamic obstacles of the respective scenery are tracked directly by the embedded decentralized ceiling sensors. By combining the Hungarian method with a Kalman filter, the trajectory of the detected dynamic obstacles can be determined. Within the discussed method, this information is transmitted directly from the sensor units to the autonomous systems and allows the local path planner to avoid collisions. Within the implementation of both methods in an industrial demonstrator, the functionality of both services could be validated. The necessary real-time capability for a valid collision avoidance was not achieved due to the computing capacities in use.}

Deploying UAVs from the truck enables customers located further from the depot to receive drone-based deliveries. The problem is first formulated as a mixed integer linear program (MILP). However, owing to the computational complexity of this problem, only trivially-sized problems may be solved directly via the MILP. Thus, a heuristic solution approach that consists of solving a sequence of three subproblems is proposed. Extensive numerical testing demonstrates that this approach effectively solves problems of practical size within reasonable runtimes. Additional analysis quantifies the potential time savings associated with employing multiple UAVs. The analysis also reveals that additional UAVs may have diminishing marginal returns. An analysis of five different endurance models demonstrates the effects of these models on UAV assignments. The model and heuristic also support anticipated future systems that feature automation for UAV launch and retrieval.}

abstract = {The closed-loop dynamics of sustainable supply chains play a key role in their performance, as the reverse flows of returns and remanufactured products entail new sources of uncertainty that alter the normal performance of the supply chain. However most of the studies assume a linear supply chain with a single reverse flow of returns, which is a simplification that may not hold in most of the existent supply chains, which often show more complex structures with several flows of returns. When there are several return flows, a critical decision for the supply chain dynamic performance is whether the remanufacturing process should be centralised (i.e. a single facility jointly remanufactures the returns from all the locations) or decentralised (i.e. the remanufacturing takes place independently in each location). This paper explores the impact of this critical decision on the performance of a divergent closed-loop supply chain with several point-of-sales and reverse flows. A simulation model is developed considering different return rates, information transparency levels, and number of nodes in the supply chain. Findings reveal that a centralized configuration reduces the uncertainty in the reverse flows of remanufactured products, smoothing the production orders of the involved organizations and improving their inventory performance. As a drawback, upstream members of the supply chain may face a higher uncertainty due to some correlation of orders. As such, this configuration may not be recommended in long supply chains with a significant number of return flows and high average return volumes, unless there is a high transparency of information. Furthermore, guidelines for managers are provided in order to reduce the bullwhip effect when implementing these circular economy practices.}

Additional damages will occur if isolated areas cannot be supplied relief goods quickly. Therefore, to provide adequate relief goods to the demand area in time, it is essential to recover the destroyed roads and make the isolated areas accessible. In addition, relief goods should be distributed on the basis of optimal scheduling. If the order for repairing destroyed roads and supplying relief goods to an isolated area is established from the respective viewpoints, a delay will occur compared to optimal schedule considering both of them simultaneously. Thus, this study proposes a mathematical model based on Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) and an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm providing optimal scheduling by taking into account both reconstruction and delivery. By conducting various numerical experiments, the solution from the MILP and ACO could lead to more effective results than decisions based on two points of view that are not synchronized. Some meaningful findings are also found by numerous computational experiments. This research can help to make the optimal decision for scheduling of recovery and supply that thus reduces any additional damage after a major disaster.}

The paper addresses the open design and application questions discussed in the literature and satisfies the operational requirements of the Swedish Armed Forces (SwAF). The proposed segmentation model builds on three dimensions: the operational requirements of the SwAF, the market's ability to deliver supplies on time, and limitations in the SwAF operational capability if the market does not deliver supplies on time. To reduce complexity, we propose a two-stage model in which we use one dimension as a precursor to a two-dimensional model. In the latter, we merge sixteen elements into one square along with three other segments which users should treat differently. The paper contributes to extant academic knowledge on PPMs by eliciting practitioners' views on open design and application questions. We develop the proposed segmentation model in cooperation with practitioners and believe that it will be of value in defence procurement practice.}

A combinational approach, which integrates the steady-state probabilities of repairable reconfigurable machine tools (RMTs) and inventory-state probabilities of buffers through an improved universal generating function, is introduced in this study to assess the compound performance indicators (CPIs) of a repairable RMS. This paper contributes to the existing literature by considering the availability of buffers to calculate the CPIs of an RMS. In the proposed approach, the dynamic-state probability for each RMT is determined with a homogeneous continuous-time Markov model, and steady-state probability is obtained as the limit of the dynamic probability as time tends to infinity. In addition, a descriptive input-output information flow, which combines the conveying processes of the machined parts through buffers with the Poisson process, is proposed to determine the inventory-state probabilities of the buffers. Moreover, the explicit expressions of the CPI and expected performance rate (for the RMS and its constituent RMTs) are determined, and the validation procedure and technical details of the performance analysis for the Monte Carlo simulation are presented. Finally, a non-serial, repairable, multi-state RMS with multiple buffers that produces three types of engine cylinder heads is presented to validate the proposed approach. The simulation results verify the accuracy of the performance assessment of the RMS. It is useful for performance improvement in terms of machine reliability, resource utilisation efficiency, and decision-making concerning the configuration of RMS with buffers.}

The rising number of initiatives to establish and operate urban consolidation centers and their low success rates signal the need for better mechanisms to manage cooperation in this context. We introduce and study cooperative situations comprising a set of carriers with time sensitive deliveries who can consolidate their cargo to obtain savings. We introduce the class of Dispatch Consolidation (DC) games and search for ways to fairly allocate the obtained savings among the participating carriers. When delivery capacities are not restrictive, i.e. when waiting costs trigger truck dispatches, we show that stable allocations in the core always exist and can, in their entirety, be found by solving a compact linear program. With restrictive capacities, however, the core of a DC game may become empty. We introduce the notion of component-wise core for DC games to preserve stability first and foremost among the carriers whose deliveries are dispatched together in the chosen optimal solutions. The novelty of our approach is to link the stability requirements of an allocation rule with the structure of selected solutions for the underlying optimization problems. We characterize the component-wise cores of DC games, prove their non-emptiness, and suggest proportionally calculated allocations therein. Finally, we discuss a refinement of component-wise core allocations that minimizes envy among the carriers who are dispatched separately.}

Order splitting can lead to higher shipping costs, the use of more packages, and possible dissatisfaction from customers. This paper presents a multi-warehouse package consolidation approach aimed at consolidating multiple suborders’ stock-keeping units (SKUs) through transshipments among warehouses. A combined multi-commodity network flow model is proposed to determine the consolidation warehouses for each order and make transshipment decisions for individual SKUs. An enhanced logic-based Benders’ decomposition algorithm is proposed to decompose the model into a general multi-commodity network flow master problem and a set of bin packing with conflicts sub-problems. Two proposed Benders’ cuts guarantee the algorithm to converge to optimality. The proposed algorithm can generate the near-optimal result with only about 25% of the CPU time required by CPLEX to solve the proposed model. Numerical experiments reveal that the proposed package consolidation approach outperforms the order splitting fulfillment approach in reducing the total costs, the number of packages, and the delivery times, especially for cases with a small number of SKUs in each suborder which are typical for online retailers. Sensitivity analyses are performed to provide managerial insights of adopting the proposed approach in the real world where order splitting is a common phenomenon.}

In this paper we analyze the effect of improved global logistics and trade facilitation on transport mode choice in international trade using the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) model of global trade which we modify to incorporate modal choice. To parameterize this model, we develop a continuous modal choice model and estimate the associated elasticities of substitution between transport modes. We find that modal substitution elasticities have values ranging from 0.57 to 2.14, indicating significant response to changes in the relative cost of different modes of goods transport. The quality of logistics infrastructure is also found to influence modal choice in international trade with improved logistics performance generally leading to increased reliance on air transportation. We validate the modified and parameterized GTAP model by simulating the impact of improvements in logistics, measured as a change in the Logistics Performance Index (LPI). We find that improvement in LPI in the poorest countries of the world reduces the overall cost of transport and amount of services required to transport a given product along a given route by a given mode. Importantly, the reduction in modal cost of transport results in modal substitution. We use the framework to explore the consequences of an improvement in low income country logistics performance for GDP and economic welfare.}

abstract = {The withdrawal from rural homesteads (WRH) refers to a mechanism to encourage villagers to withdraw from their vacant homesteads or give up their occupied homesteads (including the houses built on them) voluntarily and move into high-rise buildings with compensation. WRH aims to address inefficient utilization of rural land in China. However, the endowment effect, a behavioral tendency for villagers to value rural homesteads more highly when they own them relative to when they do not, may affect the process of implementing WRH policy. Based on survey data from 878 villagers in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, this paper estimates endowment effects for different types of villagers whose rights to their rural homesteads could be withdrawn. It then makes an empirical analysis on the differences and influencing factors of villagers’ endowment effects related to WRH via a binary logistic model querying emotional attachment, property right status, and substitutability of rural homesteads. The results show 70.62 % of sampled villagers exhibit an intensive endowment effect after WRH. Meanwhile, as non-agricultural economic activities increase, villagers’ endowment effects intensify. In terms of influencing factors, emotional attachment and cognition of inheritance rights strengthen the degree of pain experienced by villagers when they withdraw from their rural homesteads, thereby enhancing endowment effects. Property certificates and cognition of disposal rights negatively affect villagers’ endowment effects. From the perspective of villagers’ differentiation, cognition of mortgage rights intensifies the feelings of security within rural homesteads for full-time agricultural households, thereby intensifying endowment effects. Substitutability of villagers' livelihood positively affects endowment effects in full-time agricultural households and negatively affects endowment effects in non-agricultural households. This paper concludes by discussing the land use policy implications of these findings.}

abstract = {This paper considers the design of a supply chain network for the delivery of asteroid-derived resources to customers in Earth orbit. The network features orbital nodes consisting of an asteroid source, an orbital propellant depot, arrival and departure parking orbits, and customer spacecraft. Edges between nodes represent transfer trajectories modelled as impulsive manoeuvres. Two classes of spacecraft vehicles are assigned to transport the product through various edges in the network. We determine the optimal location of nodes, and vehicle routes through the network (a location-routing problem) with the objective of maximizing either the total sellable mass delivered to customers, or the total net present value of the asteroid mining venture. The depot and parking orbit locations are to be selected from a discrete set of candidate locations with variable orbital radius and orientation. Vehicle routes are to be chosen from two candidate routes that ensure reusability over multiple mining trips. A mathematical formulation is presented to describe the objective function as a function of the candidate node locations and vehicle routes. We develop a set of constrained optimization problems to determine the optimal location and orientation of parking orbits, depot location, and vehicle routes though the network. Solution methods are developed using integer programming. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the method for the case of maximizing total sellable mass delivered from a near-Earth asteroid to a single customer in Geostationary Orbit. The results showed that the maximum sellable mass is achieved with a delivery route in which the mining spacecraft remains in a highly elliptical parking orbit before returning to the asteroid, while a small transport spacecraft retrieves the load of material and delivers it to an orbital propellant depot and customers. The optimal location of a propellant depot is found to be at the same orbital radius and orbital plane as the customers. This depot location and vehicle routing can deliver between 33.15 and 52.63% of the mass extracted from the asteroid in a single trip (depending on the trajectories to/from the target asteroid), with the ability to conduct numerous return trips to the asteroid.}

The goal is to improve routing decisions by adopting appropriate travel time functions between pairs of locations that are built upon the basis of freely available information gathered from collaborative consumption platforms. In first place, data collected from Uber Movement ® platform is used to identify the 1-hour consolidated traffic patterns based on coordinates and time of the day for all pairs of neighborhoods within the city. However, not all the information is available, as there might exist some journeys scarcely required by Uber users. To overcome this problem, a K-nearest neighbor regression is used to predict missing travel times when required and considering as an input the coordinates and the time of the day. Then, a piecewise linear function representing the travel time between pairs of locations is constructed by assuming that a breakpoint, or change in the travel time behavior, takes place at the middle point of each one-hour time frame. A set of piecewise linear functions is then obtained after solving a system of linear equations. Following, two different approaches are used to generate solutions for a technician routing and scheduling problem with hard time windows. The first consists in an approximation Integer Programming model that represents the problems using an acyclic directed graph. The second consist in a Memetic Algorithm that minimizes the number of vehicles and vehicles field time. Preliminary results show that both approaches present similar results and can be used in practical applications.}

We show how it can be used to improve algorithms in automated storage and retrieval systems. An automated storage and retrieval system includes storage blocks and storage and retrieval machines that either move to retrieve unit loads from their current locations in the system to a depot or take unit loads from a depot and store them to specific locations in the system. Given n storage and retrieval requests in a system with k depots and one storage and retrieval machine, we show that our algorithm for HMATSP-kFVS can solve the problem of minimizing total traveling time of the storage and retrieval machine in O(nk+n3) time when all depots are specialized (each depot fulfills one type of requests) and in O(n2k+n3) time when depots are regular (each depot fulfills both types of requests). The best previous algorithm only solves the special case of the problem with 2 regular depots in O(n6) time. The applicability of our algorithm for several generalizations and special cases of the problem is also discussed. Furthermore, to evaluate the performance of our solution method, we perform extensive numerical experiments.}

Generalised costs include transportation costs, handling costs and transit time costs. The models of the transportation infrastructure network (roads, railway lines, ports, intermodal terminals) and of transportation and handling costs are described, including the definition of nonlinear unitary transportation costs. The methodology and models are implemented in a computer code and applied in a case study focused on the characterization of container terminal potential hinterlands across the western Iberian Peninsula. The results allow the identification of the main hinterland of different terminals in a multi-port system and the analysis of the effects of intermodal terminals in promoting a regionalization process, enabling the characterization of ‘island formations’. A hinterland contestability index is proposed and used to evaluate the degree of competition between container terminals.}

In a typical forest, the supply of chips from roadside landings to the end-using facilities, such as combined heat and power plants, the balance of production capacities between chippers and the transportation of the chips by truck-trailer combinations substantially influence the performance of the system. The aim of this study was to investigate how new innovative chipper and vehicle types with increased chip carrying capacity would affect the cost and energy efficiency of the entire supply system. A method involving discrete-event simulation was used to investigate efficient solutions for the forest chip supply chain. By running several case scenarios, the aim was to examine the supply costs and efficiencies of new supply systems, and to investigate the difference at supply level between logging residues and small-diameter trees as raw materials. The study confirmed that new vehicle types with an increased chip load capacity can improve the cost, fuel economy and efficiency of forest chip supply. The results indicate that for most scenarios and transportation distances, the use of larger, 69-tonne truck-trailers with electronic trailer steering systems in combination with a highly productive traditional chipper unit was the set-up with the lowest cost per megawatt hour. However, smaller, 52-tonne semitrailer alternative vehicles also increased their competitiveness in cases where the material being transported had a higher moisture content or higher bulk-weight density.}

abstract = {Most existing facility location and network design models assume the facility cost as either a fixed cost term or a linear/concave function of the volume of demand assigned to a facility. In particular, a concave cost function implies decreasing marginal cost and exhibits economies of scale. However, when the assigned demand volume exceeds a certain level, diseconomies of scale may occur due to facility congestions, overuse of resources, increasing operational complexity, and so on, leading to a convex cost function with increasing marginal cost. This paper studies a warehouse–retailer network design problem, which simultaneously optimizes the warehouse locations, the warehouse–retailer assignment, and the multi-echelon inventory replenishment policy to minimize the total cost, including the warehouse location and operating costs, the inventory replenishment cost, and the transportation cost. In this paper, the warehouse operating cost is defined as a general function of the volume of demand assigned to a warehouse, which could be concave first due to economies of scale and then convex due to diseconomies of scale. We formulate this problem as a set-covering model and propose a column generation algorithm to solve its linear relaxation. The pricing problem of the column generation process, although formulated as a nonlinear mixed integer program, has nice structural properties and can be solved efficiently by a branch-and-bound method. To validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed column generation algorithm, we conduct numerical studies based on randomly generated instances. Numerical results also demonstrate the impact of economies and diseconomies of scale on network design decisions and warehouse operating cost.}

ROS, established based on the fruitful studies of vehicle routing problem (VRP), has been applied in various industries and forms. During daily operations, dynamic traffic conditions, varying restriction policies, road constructions, drivers’ progressing familiarity with the routes and destinations are all common factors affecting the performance of ROS. However, most current systems are designed in a one-way and open-loop manner, i.e. these systems do not track how the planned vehicle routes are performed, which hinders the continuous improvement of the system and would lead to the failure of the system. This study proposes a smart product-service system (SPSS) approach to design an IoT-based ROS, arguing that the product (i.e. the ROS) and services (updating base data and learning users’ behaviors automatically to optimize the system) should be designed as a bundle. For this end, IoT devices are employed to acquire real-time information and feedbacks of vehicles and drivers, which are used to assess the execution of planned routes and dynamically modify the base data. Moreover, the driving records from IoT devices reveal drivers’ improving familiarity with routes and destinations, which will be considered to optimize the assignment of routes to drivers. Finally, we use a case of retailing industry to show the advantages of the proposed SPSS approach.}

A scenario-based robust approach is adapted to the model to tackle the inherent uncertainty of the problem, such as a great deal of a periodic variation in demands and facilities disruptions. It is considered that the effect of disruption in facilities depends on the initial investment level for opening them, which are affected by the allocated budget. The usage of the model is implemented by a real-world case example that addresses the demand and disruption probability as uncertain parameters. For large-scale problems, two meta-heuristic algorithms, namely the self-adaptive imperialist competitive algorithm and invasive weed optimization, are presented to solve the model.

The impact these systems have on downstream order picking performance is largely unknown. To study the interactions between upstream storage and downstream picking systems, we develop a novel analytical model for integrated storage and order picking systems. The resulting semi-open queuing model is solved using the matrix-geometric method. Using the queuing network model, we are able to study the effect of storage system technology on order throughput times, and the effect of the picking station input buffer size on order picking performance. Further, we analyze the effect of a constant work-in-process (CONWIP) control for orders on system performance. Our results indicate that using SBS/R instead of AS/R-based storage systems yields investment cost savings (i.e., fewer aisles in the storage area and fewer picking stations), paired with a lower total throughput time at a given order arrival rate. Numerical studies show how the total throughput time, first, benefits and then becomes stable by increasing the input buffer size at the picking stations. Retrieving item tote at the storage system in advance with respect to the picker availability is also advantageous, especially in the SBS/R system.}

This is the problem of determining the quantity and time of the returned products to be disassembled while satisfying the demand of their parts or components over a planning horizon. Due to the existence of yield (in a disassembly system) and demand, which are not well balanced during planning horizon, surplus inventory of leaf items will be conducted. The integer programming (IP) can be used to arrive at optimal solution, with the disadvantage that the computational time explodes with increasingly complex product structure and larger size of problem. In this case, LP relaxation approach can be useful. Two integer programming models (aggregate formulation (AGG) and disaggregate formulation (FAL)) with considering disposal decision are developed to cope with the unnecessary surplus inventory. This paper focus on the problem with no capacity restriction on disassembly resource, and single product type with two-level product structure. The computation experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of proposed models using CPLEX solver for different generated instance sizes. For large-sized problem, LP relaxation approach is suggested and compared with integer/optimal solution to show its effectiveness. The LP relaxation gives a strong lower bound (LB) for the proposed mixed-integer programming models.}

We present a dedicated lift operating policy under which it uses one lift for storage and another for retrieval, and a general operating policy under which it uses both lifts for storage and retrieval. We propose queuing networks for single-tier and multi-tier systems based on two different policies for operating the lifts (a dedicated and general operating policy). We validate the analytical models using simulation based on a real application. We also conduct a sensitivity analysis in which we vary speeds of lifts and car rotation. Then we use the analytical models to optimize the system layout by minimizing the retrieval time. Furthermore, combining time efficiency and system cost, we find an appropriate system layout for designers. Third, we compare two lifts under dedicated and general operating policies. Forth, we find the optimal number of the lifts through a general compact automated parking system.

We develop the tool to run on a spreadsheet environment rather than producing a standalone application by aiming at providing more convenience for the user to perform tasks such as data manipulation and reporting. The paper also presents an example case for illustration. The tool allows the user (i.e., decision makers) to allocate temporary-disaster-response facilities under many different after-disaster situations (scenarios) considering the possible uncertainties to occur after a disaster (i.e., different affected population rates, planning periods etc.). Although we present some example cases in the paper for illustration purposes, the flexibility of the tool allows its users to consider other cases with many other scenarios.

abstract = {Road freight transportation accounts for a significant share of the worldwide CO2-Emissions, indicating that respective operations are not sustainable. Regarding the forecasted increase in CO2-Emissions from this sector, undertaking responsibilities for its environmental impact are needed. Although technical and strategic solutions to reduce emissions have been introduced, or are in development, these rarely yield instant emission reduction potentials. A strategic approach to reducing them instantly, based on the given infrastructure and existing vehicle fleet, may be achieved through route optimization. Route optimization is a well-researched topic in the transportation domain. However, it is mainly used to reduce transportation times and expenses. Rising expectations towards sustainability by authorities and consumers led to an increased interest in route optimization in which environmental externalities, such as fuel consumption and CO2-Emissions are minimized. This paper introduces a Geographic Information System (GIS) based 3D-Routing-Model, which incorporates models to estimate vehicle fuel consumption while taking effects, such as road inclination and varying velocities into account. The proposed model utilizes a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) to enrich a road network with elevation data. The 3D-Routing-Model is applied in different distribution scenarios within the framework of an artificial company in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, Portugal to evaluate the effects of road inclination on vehicles fuel consumption and its proportional CO2-Emissions. Results indicate that eco-friendly routes can yield significant fuel and emission saving potentials of up to 20% in the tested scenarios. However, eco-friendly routes are characterized by longer distances as well as operation times, which leads to increased expenses. The question remains if companies within the transportation sector are more interested in maximizing their profits, or investing in a sustainable future.}

The area covered by the research is the Szczecin Metropolitan Area, Poland. The study has demonstrated that despite the features that univocally determine the place and role of rail transport on the service market, it is important to implement innovative solutions that involve rail transport. The concept presented by the authors can help use railway to carry cargoes on short distances in urban areas. The proposed system is in line with the assumptions of sustainable development of transport. The conducted research has shown that implementation of the LFR is conditioned by a number of factors of technical and organisational nature, but it can contribute to achieving certain short- and long-term benefits. The LFR concept is an autonomous solution that can be implemented in individual urban areas, regardless of any solutions applied in other areas within a given transport chain.}

Introducción
La prematuridad extrema se asocia a altas tasas de mortalidad. Para profesionales y familias, es prioritario establecer de forma individualizada las probabilidades de muerte en diferentes momentos. El objetivo de este estudio es efectuar una revisión sistemática de modelos predictivos de mortalidad en prematuros publicados recientemente.
Métodos
Doble búsqueda de artículos publicados en PubMed sobre modelos predictivos de muerte en prematuros. Población estudiada: prematuros con edad gestacional ≤ 30 semanas o peso al nacer ≤ 1.500g. Inclusión: trabajos publicados con nuevos modelos desde junio del 2010 hasta julio del 2019, tras revisión sistemática de Medlock (2011). Se valoran: población, características de modelos, variables utilizadas, medidas de funcionamiento y validación.
Resultados
De 7.744 referencias (primera búsqueda) y 1.435 (segunda búsqueda), se seleccionaron 31 trabajos, incluyéndose al final 8 nuevos modelos. Cinco modelos (62,5%) se desarrollaron en América del Norte y 2 (25%) en Europa. Un modelo secuencial (Ambalavanan) permite realizar predicciones de muerte al nacer, 7, 28 días de vida y 36 semanas posmenstruales. Análisis de regresión logística múltiple en el 87,5% de modelos. La discriminación poblacional se midió por odds ratio (75%) y área bajo la curva (50%). La «validación» se ha realizado en 5 modelos (interna). Tres modelos disponen de acceso online. No hay modelos predictivos validados en España.
Conclusiones
La toma de decisiones basada en modelos predictivos permite una mayor individualización de la atención dada a un niño prematuro y una mejor utilización de recursos. Es necesario desarrollar modelos de predicción de mortalidad en prematuros de España.
Introduction
Extreme prematurity is associated with high mortality rates. The probability of death at different points in time is a priority for professionals and parents, and needs to be established on an individual basis. The aim of this study is to carry out a systematic review of predictive models of mortality in premature infants that have been published recently.
Methods
A double search was performed for article published in PubMed on models predicting mortality in premature neonates. The population studied were premature neonates with a gestational age of ≤30 weeks and / or a weight at birth of ≤1500g. Works published with new models from June 2010 to July 2019 after a systematic review by Medlock (2011) were included. An assessment was made of the population, characteristics of the model, variables used, measurements of functioning, and validation.
Results
Of the 7744 references (1st search) and 1435 (2nd search) found, 31 works were selected, with 8 new models finally being included. Five models (62.5%) were developed in North America and 2 (25%) in Europe. A sequential model (Ambalavanan) enables predictions of mortality to be made at birth, 7, 28 days of life, and 36 weeks post-menstrual. A multiple logistic regression analysis was performed on 87.5% of the models. The population discrimination was measured using Odds Ratio (75%) and the area under the curve (50%). “Internal Validation” had been carried out on 5 models. Three models can be accessed on-line. There are no predictive models validated in Spain.
Conclusions
The making of decisions based on predictive models can lead to the care given to the premature infant being more individualised and with a better use of resources. Predictive models of mortality in premature neonates in Spain need to be developed.}

The government has forced the manufacturer through regulations to take care their end-of-life products for reducing the environmental damage. Meanwhile, an increase in the consumers’ environmental awareness leads to a competitive advantage to the manufacturer who has environmentally friendly products and processes. This study considers the green efforts from the manufacturer and retailer to deal with the government regulations and the consumers' environmental awareness. The purpose of this study is to investigate the behavior of supply-chain members in the green supply chain management under the reward-penalty mechanism from the government. Under the game-theoretical settings, the manufacturer seeks to maximize his/her profit by considering the optimal behaviors of the retailer and/or independent third party. The equilibrium solutions of the proposed models are obtained in the closed-form format. We found that the return rate and green effort can be improved by the reward-penalty mechanism. When considering decentralized channels under the reward-penalty mechanism, the manufacturer collects used products is deemed more effective when he/she cannot offer a higher transfer price.}

abstract = {The joint economic lot sizing problem (JELP) model provides a global view to facilitate the development of a production-inventory policy for an integrated system. However, when a deteriorating item is involved, previous studies have neglected the following two important issues: (1) the deterioration quantity increases the demand for the supplier's capacity, which consequently requires the supplier to recalculate the corresponding average cost and reevaluate the capacity utilization, and (2) given the supplier's production rate, in-transit deterioration imposes restrictions on the delivery distance or in-transit time. Therefore, the existing integrated policies may lead to infeasible solutions for the distribution channel when a deterioration item is included. In view of these two issues, a generalized JELP model under delay in payments is formulated to investigate the integrated production-inventory policy for an item with two-stage deterioration (in-transit and retail deterioration) while incorporating both transportation time and capacity utilization. By developing the average cost functions of the supply chain members and employing several new definitions (e.g., variable capacity utilization), this paper provides a mechanism for measuring the influence of two-stage deterioration on the supplier's capacity utilization for the JELP. Three algorithms are proposed to obtain optimal decisions based on the theoretical results. This paper demonstrates that the supplier's variable capacity utilization is relevant to transportation time and two-stage deterioration, which can be applied to evaluate the feasibility of the integrated production-inventory policy for the deteriorating item. Furthermore, there is a maximum allowable value for the retailer's order cycle.}

This study investigates the input procurement and semi-processed item allocation decisions of a producer in a multi-product-type and two-stage production system subject to yield uncertainty. A make-to-order production environment with deterministic production leadtimes is considered. For the problem, a discrete stochastic optimization model with binomial yield at each production stage is proposed. Optimal solution is determined with a novel solution algorithm developed by showing the convexity of the problem. The model is applicable not only to production in industries such as chemical, electronic, and mechanical manufacturing, but also to process types such as transportation and remanufacturing. As result of a comprehensive sensitivity analysis, it is found that improving yield in a single stage may not be effective in ensuring cost savings, improvements in different stages should be considered together. More interestingly, higher demand does not always lead to higher production, in contrast it may even reduce production amounts under yield uncertainty.}

Customer demand is met from either newly manufactured items, remanufacturing used items collected from customers for recovery, or from both. Mathematical models are developed to find the production (manufacturing and remanufacturing) and inventory policies that minimize the CLSC total cost. One of the models considers emissions from production and transportation and accounts for energy usage. The results showed that higher collection rates of used items reduce the supply chain costs and improves its environmental performance. A mixed strategy of manufacturing and remanufacturing was found to be best for the chain.}

This paper focuses on optimizing a closed-loop citrus supply chain. To this end, a multi-objective mathematical model is formulated that it attempts to minimize total costs, to maximize demands' responsiveness, and to minimize CO2 emissions as environmental damages. To solve the proposed model, five meta-heuristic algorithms include a multi-objective version of the recently published algorithm called tree growth algorithm (MOTGA) and four well-known algorithms called NSGA-II, NRGA, MOKA, and MOSA are utilized. It should be noted that these algorithms are tuned using the Taguchi method to achieve better performance and these are validated using the ε-constraint method in small size examples. It shows that the ε-constraint cannot solve the large size problems and it implies the NP-hardness of the problem. Moreover, the MOTGA is selected as the best approach with the least distance from the ideal point. Finally, to more measurement, a sensitivity analysis is performed and the results confirmed the efficiency of the proposed algorithms. Based on the results, it is shown that multiple transportation vehicles can reduce CO2 emissions and improved all objective functions’ values. In addition, considering multiple vehicles improved responsiveness by about 14%. So, considering two new assumptions include CO2 emissions and multiple vehicles in this model, can lead to improve demand responsiveness and emissions reductions.}

The concept of Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM) ensures that eco-friendly practices have been adopted by many global fashion brands. Fashion industries in developing countries such as Vietnam, one of the leading fashion manufacturing countries in South-East Asia, are under tremendous pressure to comply with sustainability norms. Therefore, this paper aims to review the recent trends in SSCM in Vietnam's fashion and retail industries. A four-step approach was adopted: collection of information through literature or data collection (Step 1), classification and codification (step 2), input of industry experts (Step 3) and analysis of the above three inputs (Step 4). The findings showed that although Vietnam is among the top five exporting countries of textiles and garments globally, the concept of a sustainable supply chain is new to many of the Vietnamese supply chain players. Four out of five stakeholders claimed that they are attempting to achieve sustainability by reducing environmental pollution, taking care of the labor force, and pursuing future sustainable materials as well as renewable energy resources. In addition, one of the stakeholders, the retailers, regularly focus on ethical practices in their sustainable sourcing. These practices help Vietnam to concurrently diminish its environmental impact and ensuing negative consequences as well as improve the country's social and economic sustainability.}

Probabilistic results describe a distribution of the minimum selling price and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of Jatropha-based biodiesel, respectively, with an average of $1.35/L and 46.51 gCO2e/MJ-biodiesel, and the 95% likelihood to be less than $4.57/L and 127.67 gCO2e/MJ-biodiesel. Considering direct, and then both direct and indirect land use changes increase the GHG emissions relative to the baseline by 3.5 and 8 times, respectively. Jatropha oil yield, biodiesel yield and recovery rates, and Jatropha seed production rates were found to be the most influential factors on the selling price of biodiesel and associated GHG emissions. The results imply that at the Jatropha oil yield of 50 wt%, a Jatropha seed yield of at least 3.9 t/ha and 5 t/ha are required to achieve a market-competitive biodiesel selling price of $1/L, and GHG emissions including direct land use change effects below the petroleum baseline of 87.2 gCO2e/MJ. Avoiding the disturbance of forest lands in favor of Jatropha afforestation is one of the identified strategies to minimize the impacts from land use changes. These methods demonstrate a pathway towards addressing current challenges and developing an environmentally and commercially viable Jatropha-based biodiesel industry in many countries including Nepal.}
