abstract = {The real-time location systems (RTLSs) with different positioning technologies allow real-time and high-precision localization of assets. Since the usage of RTLSs technologies and their population increase, RTLSs technology selection problem that addresses many factors should be considered. Therefore, it is important to determine the performance criteria and evaluation of these technologies should be investigated before RTLSs technology is applied to the system. This paper aims to select the most appropriate RTLSs technology by using a combined fuzzy based decision-making approach. Thus, the first paper for selection of RTLSs systems in a holistic approach by combining benefit and risk factors has been revealed. The developed approach is applied to humanitarian relief logistics warehouse with four alternatives which are given as Ultra-Wide Band, Wi-Fi, UHF RFID and Active RFID for the selection. The proposed approach has been integrated with interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy (IVIF) sets that allow to deal with fuzziness inherent in decision making processes. For this aim, firstly IVIF DEMATEL is used to determine the inner and outer dependencies of the sub and main criteria; secondly, weights of the sub-criteria are obtained by using IVIF ANP. Finally, the best RTLSs technology to be used in humanitarian logistics warehouse is selected by using IVIF TOPSIS. As a result of the calculations, the best system is determined as the “Wi-Fi RTLS” system based on the given context. By the way, a sensitivity analysis has been also implemented to test and validate the developed methodology.}

Aiming at the influence of the hollowed floorboard structure of the mezzanine shelving system on the fire hazard of the logistics warehouse, the paper analyzes the smoke temperature under the impact of the hollowing rate of the mezzanine shelving system through the fire smoke spread process, and evaluates the hollowing rate of 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, and 50%. Through FDS (Fire Dynamics Simulator) simulation study, the results verify that along with the decrease of the hollowing rate and the increase of the distance, the smoke temperature gradually reduces; Furthermore, the functional relationship between respond temperature of the automatic sprinkler system and the hollowing rate was fitted by the functional relationshipY=a(1−e−bx). The R value of the position which directly above the fire source was about 0.99, and the fitting result was desirable. The research results have certain practical value for the design of automatic sprinkler system and fire risk analysis of logistics warehouses with mezzanine shelving system.}

We investigate how the choice of MC strategy (approach) affects the effectiveness of last-mile distribution. Specifically, we investigate the relative performance of the two frequently used MC approaches in terms of their ability to facilitate (propel) effective last-mile distribution. These two approaches are: (1) p–method (in which the most-urgent material always flows into disaster areas first) and (2) m–method (in which every shipment bound to disaster areas is comprised of a mix of urgent and less-urgent materials). We first analyze advantages and disadvantages of each approach from the theory perspective, and then perform numerical experiments to examine the specific conditions under which each approach performs most, or least, effectively. Results indicate that, in 83.3% of cases, the m–method (less widely used approach in practice) works more effectively than the p–method (more widely used approach).}

However, hydrogen has its drawbacks such as its fast burning speed. This suggest that studies should be conducted in order to assess and minimize the associated risks. Hence, this study aims to analyze the risk factors that lead to hydrogen logistics incidents by capturing the complexity of interdependencies in a network modeling approach. In this study, facts and figures from incident cases were acquired, and the assessment was enhanced by considering incident chains and the interdependencies among factors and effects. Then, network analysis was used to identify significant factors and significant effects in the occurrence of hydrogen logistics incidents. The results reveal that each factor plays its own role in the occurrence of an effect. The occurrence of a hydrogen logistics incident cannot be truly reduced by only considering the factors, it must consider both the factors and the effects. Tackling the occurrence of a significant factor and effect is effective for controlling and reducing the occurrence of hydrogen logistics incidents. By modeling and analyzing the interdependencies, this study contributes in revealing the topological structures and characteristics of each factor and effect in the occurrence of hydrogen logistics incidents, and the network diagrams with probabilistic estimations are useful for enhancing safety in hydrogen logistics as well as developing associated precautions.}

abstract = {This paper is among the first that proposes a synchronization measurement model for the distribution centre operation synchronization (DCOS) problem, which aims to ensure the E-commerce order’s punctuality and synchronization at the same time. The main motivation of DCOS is that the intensified competition in E-commerce market makes efficient E-commerce logistics service extremely important, which means saving logistics cost and ensuring customer service at the same time. The synchronized operation may be a possible solution to ensure efficient order transhipment in the distribution center and to save cost. We thus introduce a measurement approach that is able to address the distribution center operation synchronization (DCOS) problem such as the trade-off relationship between synchronization and punctuality. In order to get persuasive conclusions, we adopt data from a real practice case and apply CPLEX to get the optimal solution. Our computational results show that considering the asynchronous cost in the total cost objective function will greatly improve the operation synchronization in the distribution center, by saving the storage space, the equipment, and the labour resources. And if the storage cost is in a reasonable range, the synchronized operation can be realized while the punctuality is also optimized. It is found in our case that the most efficient way to improve distribution center operation is expanding inbound operation capacity.}

The goal is to determine daily tours for a traveling salesperson who collects rewards from activities in cities during a fixed campaign period. We refer to this problem as the Roaming Salesman Problem (RSP) motivated by real-world applications including election logistics, touristic trip planning and marketing campaigns. RSP can be characterized as a combination of the traditional Periodic TSP and the Prize-Collecting TSP with static arc costs and time-dependent node rewards. Commercial solvers are capable of solving small-size instances of the RSP to near optimality in a reasonable time. To tackle large-size instances we propose a two-phase matheuristic where the first phase deals with city selection while the second phase focuses on route generation. The latter capitalizes on an integer program to construct an optimal route among selected cities on a given day. The proposed matheuristic decomposes the RSP into as many subproblems as the number of campaign days. Computational results show that our approach provides near-optimal solutions in significantly shorter times compared to commercial solvers.}

At the national level, the results indicate that positive spillover exists in each period of logistics infrastructure. At the regional level, each logistics infrastructure variable’s spillover effects vary considerably among China’s three macro-regions: land transport in the central and western regions are significantly negative; air transport is positive but not significant in eastern, central, and western regions; water transport is negative in eastern and central regions; courier delivery is not significant in eastern and western regions; internet is negative in eastern and western regions; storage is positive in eastern and central regions. The findings of this study imply that suitable infrastructure investment in states with different development levels could promote regional economic development.

abstract = {This paper addresses the integration of the planning decisions concerning inbound logistics in an industrial setting (from the suppliers to the mill) and outbound logistics (from the mill to customers). The goal is to find the minimum cost routing plan, which includes the cost-effective outbound and inbound daily routes (OIRs), consisting of a sequence of deliveries of customer orders, pickup of a full truck-load at a supplier, and its delivery to the mill. This study distinguishes between three planning strategies: opportunistic backhauling planning (OBP), integrated inbound and outbound planning (IIOP) and decoupled planning (DIOP), the latter being the commonly used, particularly in the case of the wood-based panel industry under study. From the point of view of process integration, OBP can be considered as an intermediate stage from DIOP to IIOP. The problem is modelled as a Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhauls, enriched with case-specific rules for visiting the backhaul, split deliveries to customers and the use of a heterogeneous fleet. A new fix-and-optimise matheuristic is proposed for this problem, seeking to obtain good quality solutions within a reasonable computational time. The results from its application to the wood-based panel industry in Portugal show that IIOP can help to reduce total costs in about 2.7%, when compared with DIOP, due to better use of the delivery truck and a reduction of the number of dedicated inbound routes. Regarding OBP, fostering the use of OIRs does not necessarily lead to better routing plans than DIOP, as it depends upon a favourable geographical configuration of the set of customers to be visited in a day, specifically, the relative distance between a linehaul that can be visited last in a route, a neighboring backhaul, and a mill. The paper further provides valuable managerial insights on how the routing plan is impacted by the values of business-related model parameters which are set by the planner with some degree of uncertainty. Results suggest that increasing the maximum length of the route will likely have the largest impact in reducing transportation costs. Moreover, increasing the value of a reward paid for visiting a backhaul can foster the percentage of OIR in the optimal routing plan.}

In the case of the textile and clothing industries, consumption has increased steadily, especially in the clothing business, which generates large amounts of post-industrial waste. The objective of this article is to identify opportunities for improvement in the use of reverse logistics (RL) in clothing industries, as well as to list the existing strengths in the valuation of textile waste (TW) and minimize environmental impacts. To achieve this objective, a questionnaire was developed, validated and applied in a clothing cluster. The questionnaire assessed strengths and weaknesses in 8 dimensions using 32 assertions involving reverse logistics and management of textile waste. We identified in the research that: (i) there are no route facilitators between RL and TW in clothing industries; (ii) there are opportunities for the textile companies to increase the adoption of RL to combat TW; (iii) the main improvement opportunities for increasing cluster advancement in terms of RL and TW are: reuse of TW by the generating company and separating waste according to the composition of materials, which would facilitate the possibility of recycling and disclosing to consumers the importance of social and environmental practices. Conclusion remarks point that, despite the existence of strengths in the use of the RL for the TW valuing in the clothing industry, it is still required a readjustment of the destination of TW as a by-product to be used in a new cycle.}

Since building the biofuel facilities requires a huge amount of investments, designing an efficient BLNS will be essential to attract potential investors. We formulate the design problem as a multi-objective programming (MOP) model. Solving the MOP model would yield various network schemes based upon the weight given to each objective/goal. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) method could be applied to evaluate the efficiency of each BLNS generated by solving the MOP model. Several approaches based on the traditional DEA method emerge to overcome a critical weakness regarding discriminating power. This paper combines three well-known DEA methods to make the most use of each method’s strengths and to evaluate and identify the more efficient network schemes. Through a case study for South Carolina, we observe that the proposed procedure performs well in terms of designing efficient and robust BLNSs. The proposed procedure would enable the decision-makers to have more choices for BLNSs to consider before finally selecting the best scheme regarding efficiency, practicality, and feasibility.}

The research used GMM (Generalized Method of Moments) and FGLS (Feasible Generalized Least Squares) two methods to tackle the problems of heterogeneity, serial correlation and heteroskedasticity. The findings show that fossil fuel consumption is at the heart of logistics operations; the more fossil fuel and non-green energy resources that are used, the more negative effects on society and environmental sustainability result from this. A lower quality of transport-related infrastructure and logistics services is negatively correlated with fossil fuel usage, carbon emissions, health expenditure, greenhouse gas emissions and political instability of SAARC countries. Conversely, efficient customs procedures and greater information sharing among supply chain partners increase trade opportunities and also improve environmental sustainability in terms of minimum carbon emissions due to the shorter waiting and queue times involved. Further, the application of green energy resources and green practices can mitigate negative effects on social and environmental sustainability due to better logistics operations while improving financial performance in terms of higher GDP per capita, trade openness and greater export opportunities around the globe. As there is very limited research using green practices relationship with macro-level indicators in current literature, this research will assist both practitioners and policymakers to understand the roles of green supply chain and green logistics in enhancing environmental sustainability, social improvement and economic growth for a better future.}

Taking rescue time, scheduling cost and demanders’ satisfaction as goals, in this paper, an emergency supplies scheduling model based on multi-objective optimization was proposed to provide a wealth of decision-making information. Then four multi-objective optimization algorithms are employed to obtain the optimal set of scheduling models. In addition, we design the minimum time cost model and the shortest route cost model by considering the change of the road network status. The extensive simulation experiments are conducted on a real urban traffic dataset. The experimental results show that the two cost models can serve different scheduling needs and provide efficient scheduling for emergency supplies.}

abstract = {The aim of this work was to design a decentralized system for urine collection and fertilizer production within the City of Cape Town. Evaluating the effects of transportation logistics of source-separated urine collection and treatment formed the main modelling portion of this objective. It was determined that the decentralized approach to urine treatment exhibited several advantages over biological nutrient removal (BNR) at conventional wastewater treatment plants. These advantages included lower greenhouse gas emissions and energy expenditure for a similar operating cost. It was found that a positive net present value was achieved if the recovered fertilizer was sold at prices comparable to commercially available liquid fertilizers, with similar nitrogen content. Moreover, it was shown that if urine was collected from shopping malls in Cape Town, the liquid fertilizer produced would only need to be sold at $1.57/L to breakeven over a five-year period. Conversely, it was found that there was only a market for about 10% of the recovered liquid fertilizer which could be sold as a niche fertilizer ($10.5/L) but the remaining 90% of recovered liquid fertilizer would only need to be sold at a bulk value of $0.67/L over a five-year period to breakeven.}

We adopt a mean–standard deviation objective function to reflect different risk preferences and concentrate on the effects of risk preference and demand volatility. Interestingly, we discover that substitution and complementary effects exist between the interest and freight rates of the 3PL firm. The effects of risk preference and demand volatility on the equilibrium interest rate become more significant when supply chains engage in price competition. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the 3PL firm prefers a risk-averse manufacturer.}

These trends require the organizations to rethink their approaches to supply chain management, so that they could cope with the upcoming challenges. This research paper focuses on the ways a logistics cluster can provide the abilities to share information and thus improve the forecasting accuracy. The main novelty of the paper has been to work out a collaborative technological strategy which promotes information sharing in order to improve forecasting accuracy and inventory control for better alignment of demand and supply. The secondary contribution of the article is the determination of the influence of information sharing on forecasting accuracy in different market sizes, types and the consideration of consumer integration. Lastly, a sensitivity analysis has been completed to identify the optimal size of the logistics cluster the determination of which provides support when implementing the proposed strategy in practice. For the results validation we have implemented an agent-based model of the food supply chain. Our results have confirmed that information sharing increases the forecasting accuracy in multiple scenarios. Moreover, consumer integration is beneficial in a perfect competition market; however, its positive effect is less significant in an oligopoly market. These findings should be taken into consideration when developing e-commerce business strategy and forming logistics clusters. The usage of machine learning algorithms in the forecasting process provides adaptation capabilities for the supply chain members. The adaptation emerges as system resilience and it improves the alignment of demand and supply, reduces food waste levels and maintains higher nutrition value. The proposed strategy can ensure a long-term sustainable development to logistics cluster members.}

abstract = {With the rapid development of China’s ports, the growth of port throughput has led to a large increase in the amount of hinterland container transportation, causing traffic congestion and significant vehicle emissions. While a port promotes the prosperity of a city, the contradiction between the expansion of urban space and the land use required for ports has become more serious. The underground logistics system (ULS) provides a good technical option for solving these problems. Because of the large-scale projects that the ULS undertakes and the major investment required to conduct these projects, it is important to study the impact of ULS from the perspective of the urban transportation system. In this paper, an empirical method is proposed to assess the impact of the ULS on the state of traffic and the issue of emissions from the perspective of the urban road network; the specific research area is the ULS from Waigaoqiao Port to the Jiading District in Shanghai. Using highway toll data, traffic flow data, and traffic survey data, a traffic analysis model and an emissions model are established. These models are used to analyze the changes in traffic flows and emissions in the urban road network before and after the construction of the ULS. The analysis results show that the ULS can account for 27.0% of the highway transportation of containers from Waigaoqiao Port. After the construction of the ULS, the container traffic volume of the expressway segments near Waigaoqiao Port decreased by more than 20%, the emissions on most parts of Outer Ring Expressway dropped 16%–28%, and the emissions on expressways parallel to the ULS decreased 20%–40%. The empirical method proposed in this study can be considered as references for the benefit assessment of the ULS for container transportation.}

The implementation of these objectives requires access to much up-to-date information including the type and size of the flow of goods, passenger car traffic in the city, the number of accidents caused by drivers of trucks and cars, etc. Access to current data can greatly support local authorities in making the right decisions in the field of urban logistics (Małecki et al., 2014). Unfortunately, in most Polish cities such information is not collected or is collected irregularly. Consequently, in many cities decisions concerning the coordination of the flow of cargo and people in the city are made intuitively rather than based on actual data. In this paper the authors have set two - theoretical and empirical - objectives. The theoretical purpose concerns the authorial concept of a simplified city logistics information system. The empirical objective includes an analysis of the current state of logistics information systems in the selected cities and identification of the activities of Polish local governments in collecting and analysing data in the field of people and goods movement within the city. In order to identify the relationships between the extent of information collection; the size of the research city; and the organisation of the task related to the passenger and freight transport, the correspondence analysis was used.}

Furthermore, in order to guarantee the connection between the UCLS and the yard behind the ground terminal, a design of an underground parking lot in the system is also proposed. The underground parking lot is a buffer used for the loading and unloading of underground guided vehicles (UGVs). A mixed integer nonlinear programming model (MNIP) for UGVs and yard cranes in the underground system is formulated to minimize the total cost of UGVs waiting and yard cranes. Then, the optimization model is solved via MATLAB software. With sensitivity analysis, the number of loading and unloading points in the underground parking lot is optimized for the purpose of minimizing the total cost. Finally, a simulation experiment is carried out to obtain the optimal configuration of the number of loading and unloading points and the arrival rate in the UCLS.}

Based on the study of existing anti-collision algorithms, a grouped dynamic frame slot with query tree (GDQT) algorithm was designed for a large number of labeling scenarios in logistics management. The GDQT algorithm first estimates the number of tags that have not been identified after each round of identification by the tag estimation algorithm, if less than or equal to 354, the tags were first identified using the dynamic frame slot ALOHA (DFSA) algorithm., and then using the query tree algorithm (QT) for the remaining tags identification. If the number of unrecognized tags was greater than 354, the tags should be first grouped, and then DFSA and QT would be used for tags identification. The simulation results showed that GDQT algorithm can improve system throughput rate and keep throughput rate at around 0.82, which is 300%, 120%, 50% higher than the DFSA algorithm, GDFSA algorithm and AHT algorithm respectively. Therefore, The GDQT algorithm has a good application prospect in the logistics system.}

Since FMEA experts have different professional backgrounds and risk preferences, they may give evaluation from different angle and emphasis; and express different limited rational behavior. Therefore, this study proposes an improved FMEA model which considers the expert group and the bounded rational behavior of experts. Firstly, this paper develops the K-means clustering method to partition FMEA experts. Further, a calculation model of attribute weights that considers different risk attitudes is proposed. Additionally, this study proposes a combination final ranking method based on regret theory (RT) and PROMETHEE II method. A practical case and two simulation experiments are carried out to demonstrate the validity, reliability and superiority performance of the proposed FMEA model. The improved FMEA model can enhance the fairness and reasonableness of the expert evaluation, improve the adaptability and flexibility of FMEA, and enrich the theoretical research of FMEA method. Findings indicated that it is necessary to consider the grouping and risk attitudes of experts in the practical risk assessment.}

In this context, we argue that existing literature should explore more deeply the effects of public policies on operation and economic variables that shape the CL context.

The Triple Bottom Line approach is a framework that considers three strategies which are economic, environmental, and social. Disassembly has great importance in reverse logistics operations. Therefore, disassembly line balancing approach has been integrated into sustainable reverse logistics network problem for the first time. A Multi period Multi-Objective Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming model is proposed and solved with Improved Augmented Epsilon Constraint (AUGMECON-2) technique. Pareto optimal solution set is obtained. In order to demonstrate the applicability of the suggested model, developed solution procedure has been applied on end of life mobile phone recycling network. Objectives are indicated as social impact maximization, economic and environmental effect minimization. This study is applied for a three-year time period. Disassembly processes are also taken into account. The model respectively determines: (i) optimal quantity of WEEE between the facilities and inventory amounts, (ii) the number of workstations in disassembly centers (iii) the number of facilities that will be opened (iv) optimal task assignments to workstations in disassembly centers. Sensitivity analysis is proposed to examine the impact of incremental changes in WEEE amounts on the sustainable reverse logistics network. According to each scenario the number of changes in facilities, objective function values and tasks assigned to workstations are specified. This developed model could offer managers to take strategic decisions in recycling processes with regard to environmental and social impact and help to gain managerial insights as well.}

To do so site visits to all existing operational public FVs and a private FV have been made, where interviews with the management units have been conducted and comparisons to global counterparts have been made. As a result of these, it has been observed that currently, FVs in Turkey are overwhelmed due to lack of coordination and collaboration. However, also light has been shed into possible alternative working principles for Turkish FVs, and it has been showed that if coordination and collaboration could be realized, significant positive effects can be achieved in terms of different aspects regarding sustainability and social equity.}

The paper explores the crucial barriers to IT implementation in the largely unorganized logistics sector of an emerging economy, India. Through a comparative study using two separate expert-groups, representing the organized and unorganized logistics sectors respectively, the paper analyses their views on the criticality of barriers in each sector and highlights the sector-specific problems that hinder effective IT implementation. Considering the profiles of the expert groups used, the paper implements Fuzzy-ISM and Fuzzy-MICMAC analysis for one group and IRP for the other to capture and analyze their opinions appropriately. The results obtained from the analyses show that the barriers concerning IT implementation in the unorganized logistics sector (ULS) substantially differ from those concerning the organized logistics sector (OLS) as perceived by the corresponding sector experts. The study ranks the barriers in the two sectors and highlights the focus areas that require immediate attention to strengthen the IT infrastructure of Indian ULS, which suffers mainly from behavioral issues at the organizational level. Focused attention to unorganized sector’s requirements can revive the sector and smoothen its transformation to an organized one as exceedingly demanded by the recent e-commerce boom. The work is perhaps the first to address the Indian ULS. It implements a unique approach: seeks inputs from two different expert groups, implements tools appropriate to the respective panel profiles, and compares their opinions to identify the specific and different requirements of the Indian ULS with respect to IT implementation.}

abstract = {The rapid growth of China’s economy and the progress of industrialization have gradually led to serious resource depletion and environmental degradation. The Yangtze river economic belt (YREB) strategy is one of the most important strategies for the sustainable development of the “new normal” economy in China. Logistics industry, as a foundation that guarantees to implement the YREB strategy, plays a linking role in the resources exchange and trade flow in the YREB. Therefore, maximizing economic benefits while using the least amount of resources and the least damage to the environment is an urgent and critical issue for achieving sustainable development. This paper proposes to combine a super slack-based measure (super-SBM) data envelopment analysis (DEA) model and the global Malmquist index to evaluate the logistics ecological efficiency of 11 provinces/cities in the YREB from 2004 to 2016. Later, global and local Moran’s indexes are used to analyze the spatial autocorrelation of logistics ecological efficiency. Finally, a spatial econometric model is proposed to study how the influencing factors interference affect logistics ecological efficiency. The empirical results show that: (1) Compared to economically underdeveloped areas, the upstream areas of the YREB exhibit higher logistics ecological efficiency; (2) On the whole, the positive effects of technical changes are stronger, the growth of logistics ecological efficiency is driven mainly by technological progress; (3) Significant spatial correlation exist among the logistics ecological efficiency of the YREB, the upstream regions is more efficient and tend to have a positive spillover effect on neighboring provinces; (4) Foreign direct investment, government intervention, level of economic development and human capital have positive effects on the logistics ecological efficiency, whereas industrial structure, environmental regulation and logistics energy intensity have negative impacts.}

This research formulates a multi-objective Mixed-Integer Non-Linear programming (MINLP) with uncertain parameters considering Relief Centers (RC), Demand Points (DP) in affected areas, transportation methods to deliver Relief Items (RI) and different types of RIs namely, perishable and imperishable. In pre-disaster stage, location and number of RCs with their prepositioned inventory level are determined. After disaster strikes, based on a distribution plan the amount of RIs that should be transported to DPs and number of needed vehicles are determined. The objective functions minimize the total distance traveled by RIs, total costs (including RC establish cost, inventory cost, fixed cost for each vehicle type and acquisition cost for RIs), maximum traveling time between RCs and DPs and number of perished items respectively. The proposed model is solved by GAMS software for small size test problems and Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA) as a meta-heuristic approach for large size problems. Numerical and computational results are provided to prove the efficiency and feasibility of the presented model. Finally, the developed model is implemented to Iran's flood in 2019 as a case study.}

In this study, we recorded the origin, sex, age and condition of horses (121 journeys, 2648 animals) upon arrival to an abattoir in northern Mexico, including transport details. Horse welfare was measured indirectly via individual scores for body condition, coat quality, lameness, ocular and nasal discharge, as well as reactivity to a chute restraint test, all performed shortly after unloading. The average journey duration was 9.69 (±7.6) hours for horses from Mexico and 16.77 (±4.51) hours for horses from the USA (77 % of all journeys). The prevalence of ocular discharge, nasal discharge, skin wounds, lameness and diarrhoea, were 23 %, 12 %, 11 %, 9 %, 1 % (respectively) of all the horses observed, with no significant differences between Mexican and American horses (P ≥ 0.05). During the chute test the American horses were calmer than the Mexican ones (P < 0.001), who were more restless and aggressive (P = 0.001). Likewise, vocalizations in their three variants during the restraint, neigh/whinny (P = 0.018), nicker (P < 0.001), and snort (P = 0.018), were more common in horses from Mexico. In order to help characterize fitness for transport, a two-step cluster analysis was applied using the welfare indicators, suggesting the existence of four clusters (C) evaluated on arrival at the abattoir (from good to very poor fitness): good (profile C4, n = 769, 29.1 %), average (profile C1, n = 799 horses, 30.2 %), poor (profile C3, n = 586, 22.1 %) and very poor (profile C2, n = 494, 18.6 %). In fact, the C4 best welfare group had 0% lame, 0% nasal discharge, 16.4 % ocular discharge, 7.9 % skin wounds. Instead, the C2 poorest welfare group had 45.8 % lame, 61.1 % nasal discharge, 42.8 % ocular discharge, and 19.9 % skin wounds. Results show potential for using nasal discharge, lameness and ocular discharge as key indicators of horse fitness and welfare on abattoir. The study provides detailed scientific data to help establish strategies regarding optimal days of recovery post-transport and fattening for homogenization of weights between animals of different origins, logistic planning, and optimization of logistic resources to minimize the biological cost of long-distance transport.}

However, many enterprises face a problem that is how to implement the recovery of used products into their existing forward logistics networks. In this case, it is necessary to redesign a novel sustainable reverse logistics supply chain network by reconstructing the existing facilities into hybrid processing facilities. To handle the foregoing problem, a multi-objective scenario-based optimization model is proposed. It aims to maximize the expected total monetary profits, minimize the expected total carbon emission costs, and maximize the expected total created job opportunities. To solve the proposed model, we develop a method to linearize the model and then apply the weighted-sum method to reformulate it as a single-objective one. In addition to the weighted-sum method, an augmented E-constraint method is used to obtain a set of efficient Pareto-optimal solutions and the trade-off among three conflicting objectives is presented. Finally, several numerical instances from a tire supply chain are performed to validate the proposed model and some managerial implications are also concluded.}

abstract = {Municipal waste is very different in terms of physical and chemical composition. The economic use of municipal waste is the most effective method of eliminating its negative impact on environment. The main trends in the field of municipal waste quantities in Poland are analysed. It can be see that municipal waste is still the problem in Poland, especially in urban areas. The need for the reduction of waste in urban area results in an zero waste city concept. This concept can be supported by reverse logistics. Guidelines for the implementation of the tasks in the field of the reverse logistics are located especially in the province plans of the waste management. That is why the aim of the article is to identify the trends in the size of the flows of municipal waste. The trends in cities, which are the main object of reverse logistics of municipal waste and the concept of zero waste cities, are measured separately. The zero waste concept necessitates the activities of reverse logistics because it is not possible to reduce municipal waste without the proper organization of waste flows and infrastructure which is the function of reverse logistics. Ecologically and economically effective organization of waste flows often stretches beyond the city and encompasses a larger region around it. In Poland the guidelines concerning the organization of the flows of waste materials are part of regional plans and strategies for waste management. For this reason the classification of the Polish provinces using the following diagnostic features: municipal waste collected according to the treatment operations, municipal waste collected by fractions, mixed municipal waste collected, landfilling of municipal waste by urban areas, degassing of landfill sites has been added to the research.. Accepted for analysis variables reflect the effects of implementation of solutions of reverse logistics. The breakdown is conducted with the use of multidimensional statistical analysis. Data from the years 2012 and 2016 were analyzed.}

This study aims to introduce the low-carbon economy into the cold chain logistics. There are various costs needed to be considered in cold chain logistics, and a cold chain logistics route optimization model included the carbon emission cost was developed. Ribonucleic acid computing was combined with ant colony optimization to prevent the influence of unreasonable parameter selection on algorithm performance. This novel proposed approach was applied to solve the route optimization problem of a cold chain logistics firm located in the Xiong'an, China. The results showed this method reduced the overall cost of logistics and minimized the amount of carbon emissions.

In particular, the Data envelopment analysis (DEA) model and Malmquist index from both the static and dynamic perspective were explored. To further capture the driving factors of the carbon emissions performance in logistics, the Tobit model was applied to perform regression analysis. The results indicate that (1) with regards to static performance, two northwest cities, Nujiang and Diqing, have reached the technological frontier; (2) regarding dynamic performance, although six cities have improved, the average dynamic logistics carbon emissions performance of all the cities decreases by approximately 5.9% from 2011 to 2015; (3) in terms of driving factors, the economic development factor is found to be positively and significantly related to static carbon emissions performance, whereas others indicate negative and significant relationships.}

It starts from a basic two-stage Stackelberg game model, then, extends to three scenarios where either the integrator or the provider or neither of them has loss-averse preference. The impact of loss-averse preference on the decisions of supply chain members is discussed by comparing the four models. Our results reveal, first, the loss-averse preferences do not always affect the decisions of supply chain members. If certain conditions are satisfied, the logistics service integrator can benefit from its loss-averse preference. Second, the increased service level can affect the logistics service integrator's procurement strategy and the functional logistics service provider's pricing strategy. This effect is only related to the loss-averse preference of the functional logistics service provider. Last, under certain conditions, the total service capacity decreases with the increased service level, regardless of whether or not the supply chain members have loss-averse preferences.}

The economic analysis employs a theoretical model developed in a previous study, which determines the optimal number of facilities in the network and the routing of vehicles that will visit the retail stores to collect the wasted food, returning the total logistics cost as output. Compared to the previous study, in this paper the real location of the stores is taken into account in the assessment.

This study proposes a hybrid framework using Modified Step-Wise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) and Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment (WASPAS) to achieve the objective of this research. The relative effect of barriers is evaluated using Modified SWARA, while WASPAS is used to prioritize the solutions of barriers to reverse logistics implementation. The empirical case investigation of an Indian electrical manufacturing industry is conducted to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework. The solution ‘Formulate and enforce strict yet supportive laws, policies for returns and end of life components’ is most prominent for mitigating barriers. This research presents a structured and systematic approach for organizations to mitigate reverse logistics implementation barriers through the proposed solutions. Also, this research lists out few novel barriers and its solutions from the case company prospective. The proposed solutions are effective in solving multiple barriers simultaneously.

The key feature of Industry 4.0 characterized by virtualization of factory operations is captured using the simulation model. For the analysis, using the Taguchi experimental design framework, we present valuable managerial insights. Our findings suggest the relevant adoption patterns based on the combination of information-sharing and I&PP policies for the tradeoff between environmental and economic performance. An extensive sensitivity analysis shows the robustness of the model. Further, the managerial decisions on the environmental and economic performance measures reveal that in spite of the presence of Industry 4.0 technology capabilities, a close attention should be paid to operational parameters and their related costs when socially influenced green product adoption with the parameters such as size of end-user market and collection investment are governing the returns of the product to the reverse logistics system. Accordingly, the model exhibits a real-time decision support tool for the sustainable reverse logistics system in Industry 4.0 environment at large.}

This paper addresses the optimal design of a hybrid assembly-recycling network that simultaneously integrates the forward and reverse logistics among its multi-product multi-echelon superstructure. Multiple sources of raw materials including components and parts are considered at different stages of the forward assembly process. The problem investigates three recycling options for final products, semi-products and modules. Various types of uncertainties on return flow and waste flow are investigated. To optimize the dual-system superstructure, the problem is hereby modeled by a fuzzy mixed integer linear programming approach. Piecewise linear membership functions are constructed for the objectives to represent the diversified satisfactory degrees which preferably comply with the real-world decision scenarios. Further, an interactive fuzzy optimization approach is developed to solve the problem by differentiating the piece-wise sections of satisfactory degrees. Finally, an electronic assembly plant with its own recycling process is chosen as the industrial case to implement the proposed approach. Sensitivity analysis and comparison under different scenarios are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness on obtaining compromised solutions under diversified satisfactory degrees in such an uncertain environment.}

abstract = {Reverse logistics (RL) strategy can have a positive impact on productivity, and the diminishing resources, along with the strict environmental regulations, have strengthened the need for this strategy. The purpose of this study is to develop an integrated framework for identifying: (1) the critical barriers to the successful implementation of RL in the automotive industry; (2) the importance and implementation priorities of these barriers; and (3) the causal relations among them. The proposed framework is composed of the Delphi method to identify the most relevant barriers, the best-worst method (BWM) to determine their importance, and the weighted influence non-linear gauge system (WINGS) to analyze their causal relationships. The proposed framework is applied to a case study in the automotive industry. The results indicate the economic barriers are the most important, and the knowledge barriers are the least important barriers to the successful implementation of RL in the automotive industry.}

This problem and its numerous expansions are one of the most important and most applicable transportation and logistics problems. In this study, the green vehicle routing and scheduling problem with heterogeneous fleet including reverse logistics in the form of collecting returned goods along with weighted earliness and tardiness costs is studied to establish a trade-off between operational and environmental costs and to minimize both simultaneously. In this regard, a mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model is proposed. Since the problem is categorized as NP-hard, two meta-heuristics, a simulated annealing (SA) and a genetic algorithm (GA) are suggested in order to find near-optimal solutions for large instances in a reasonable computational time. The performances of the proposed algorithms are evaluated in comparison with the mathematical model for small-sized problems and with each other for problems of all size using a set of defined test problems. Analysis of the results considering two criteria: solutions quality and computational times, indicates the satisfactory performance of the presented algorithms in a proper computational time. Meanwhile, a statistical hypothesis testing (T-test) is conducted. It can generally be observed that SA achieves relatively better results in terms of solution quality, while GA spends less computational time for all-sized test problems. Eventually, sensitivity analysis is conducted to investigate the effect of collecting returned goods on the cost of total CO2 emissions, variable costs of the fleet and the objective function value.}

The dominant environmental conditions, including waves, wind, poor visibility and the presence of icebergs and sea ice determine the mode and success of logistics support. Use of helicopters as a mode of logistics transport becomes ineffective when the distance is longer, the visibility is low, or the weather is stormy. Marine logistics support is more reliable and versatile. The present work focuses on developing a model for assessing risk associated with marine logistics operations in remote offshore locations (beyond helicopter reach) frequented with harsh environmental conditions (high winds, waves, and icy conditions). The key factors that affect such operations are identified and failure models are developed using fault trees. As an improvement, advance fault trees are adopted to relax the inherent limitations of the primary model. Uncertainties in both data and model are considered using the fuzzy inference system and evidence theory. Application of the proposed model is demonstrated through a case-study concerning a remote North Atlantic offshore operation. The contribution of this study is the identification of the key factors controlling the marine logistics operation and the development of a robust risk model that helps to analyze criticality of the contributing factors. The proposed model has the potential to help to develop innovative risk management strategies to support offshore operations.}

In this problem, a distributor seeks to source and fulfill customer orders of products (fruits, meat, napkins, etc.) through a multi-echelon distribution network consisting of supplier locations, warehouses, and customer locations in a cost-effective manner. As these products are small relative to vehicle capacity, an effective strategy for achieving low transportation costs is consolidation. Specifically, routing products so that vehicles transport multiple products at a time, with each product potentially sourced by a different supplier and destined for a different customer. As instances of this problem of sizes relevant to the operations of an industrial partner are too large for off-the-shelf optimization solvers, we propose a suite of techniques for enhancing a Benders decomposition-based algorithm, including a strengthened master problem, valid inequalities, and a heuristic. Together, these enhancements enable the resulting method to produce provably high-quality solutions to multiple variants of the problem in reasonable run-times.}

Focusing on fill level monitoring we identify diverse opportunities for generating informational, automational and transformational business value.

The aim of this study is to explore the effects of organizational stakeholder pressure and regulatory stakeholder pressure on green logistics practices and financial performance whiles investigating if environmental reputation and social reputation are missing links in mediating the relationships between organizational stakeholder pressure, regulatory stakeholder pressure, green logistics practices and financial performance. It is proposed that organizational stakeholder pressure and regulatory stakeholder pressure influence green logistics practices and financial performance, and in turn, environmental reputation and social reputation mediate these relationships. A thorough review of literature showed that organizations choose to either adopt a proactive or reactive approach to green practices based on organizational or regulatory stakeholder pressures. This research adopted partial least square structural equation modeling technique in analyzing the data due to it having more predictive power. The results show that pressures from organizational and regulatory stakeholders influence the adoption and implementation of green logistics practices, thereby enhancing environmental reputation, which also improves financial performance. The results specifically highlights that regulatory stakeholder pressures significantly influences social reputation, which also significantly influence financial performance. Environmental and social reputations proved to play mediating roles in the hypothesized relationships. These findings evidence that organizational and regulatory stakeholder pressures depending on how they are responded to can be friends or foes to green logistics practices, environmental reputation, social reputation and financial performance. Thus, the scope of stakeholder pressures appear to be potent and wider than previously understood. This study was tailored to the logistics sector because previous researches have concentrated on the manufacturing sector. Moreover, few researches have incorporated reputation as an intermediate variable in the relationships between stakeholder pressures, green logistics practices and financial performance.}

This environmental investment situation and decision can be addressed through the integration of facility location, operational planning, and vehicle type selection, while simultaneously accounting for carbon emissions from vehicles, inspection centers, and remanufacturing centers in a reverse logistics (RL) context. In the current study, we present a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model to solve a multi-tier multi-period green RL network, including vehicle type selection. This research integrates facility locations, vehicle type selection with emissions producing from transportation and operations at various processing centers. Prior research does not account for carbon emissions for this design problem type. Valuable managerial insights are obtained when incorporating carbon emissions cost.}

Meanwhile, in the face of oceans of parcels to deliver, it casts requests on the efficiency of warehouse management to meet the need of customers. However, most companies conduct warehousing operations still relying on the paper for guiding and recording, and information is rarely shared even in the same company. Besides, few big companies are pursuing an automatic system to replace manpower, but in effect, the system is too mass and complicated to be stable and robust in usage. In this study, an IoT-enabled cyber-physical system assisted with wearable devices and wireless communication technologies, like RFID and Bluetooth, has been developed to cooperate with kinds of stakeholders to achieve higher operational efficiency. It has been deployed in a 3PL automotive-parts company at the Great Bay Area in China as a case study. Their nationally distributed warehouses realized real-time synchronizations of operations and information sharing within the company. Moreover, it not only highlighted the sustainability by nearly removing the paper in operations but also enhanced visibility and traceability throughout the whole process. The framework of the system and workflow proposed here can be duplicated or adjusted by other enterprises who share similar features. The success of this practice may motivate more 3PL companies to adopt cutting-edge technologies to create effective solutions for warehouse management.}

So far, network modeling in manufacturing and logistics has often focused on the description of system properties. In the data-driven world of smart manufacturing, creating material flow network models becomes a lot easier due to the ubiquitous availability of shop floor and transportation data. At the same time, these highly flexible and continuously changing smart manufacturing systems become less predictive and thus less controllable. This article investigates how the stochastic block model (SBM), a network model with a stochastic description of interconnections, can be applied to model and predict material flows in manufacturing systems. We show how to utilize its properties to forecast the dynamic development of the structure of such systems. The complete process from network modeling using material flow data to the prediction of the future development of the network is demonstrated. Different SBM variants are tested using six company data sets and evaluated in competition with classical machine learning methods for prediction. Our results show that selected SBM variants achieve the best performance in prediction in most scenarios and thus have the potential to play an important role in the management of future dynamic manufacturing systems.}

This paper proposes two novel bin packing problem settings with many practical applications, in particular in logistics capacity planning. Both problems explicitly consider, besides the classical bin-selection costs, the item and bin-specific item-to-bin assignment costs. These assignment costs depend not only on the physical, e.g., item and bin size, and economic, e.g., bin selection fixed cost and the cost of item “transport” by the bin, but also on the temporal attributes of items and bins, e.g., availability of regular bins for selection and utilization and of items to be assigned to such a regular bin. Special, item-specific in terms of size, spot-market bins may be used at higher cost for the items one cannot fit into the selected bins. Single and a multi-period formulations are proposed, both aiming to minimize the total cost of the system computed as the sum of the fixed costs of the selected bins and the total item-to-bin assignment cost using regular and spot-market bins. The multi-period formulation optimizes the cost over all the time periods considered. Several constructive heuristics are proposed, three for the single-period model, and four for the multi-period formulation. The heuristics are evaluated and compared through an extensive computational experimentation. The numerical results show the high level of performance of the proposed heuristics in terms of solution quality and computational efficiency, as well as the potential benefits of using the new models in practical applications.}

They concentrate warehouses, distribution centres and terminals in numerous logistics zones; they polarize thus regional, national and international flows. Some of these logistics facilities correspond to inland ports directly connected to seaport(s) with high capacity transport mean(s) either via rail, road or inland waterways. Their development results from the dynamic of port regionalization, which is characterised by seaports becoming integral parts of extensive hinterland networks, intermodal transport corridors and inland ports. Therefore, in city-regions, inland ports are part of larger logistics systems associating diverse logistics facilities and zones. The ways inland ports are governed, planned and owned must thus be understood in connection with the governance of the diverse logistics spaces at the metropolitan scale, including transport infrastructure and land use planning. Research has documented the very fragmented politics of logistics zones and the limited scope of spatial planning dedicated to logistics facilities and activities. The specific role and importance of the governance of inland ports within urban and regional governance arrangements framing and supporting logistics development is still unclear. In order to contribute to a systematic urban and regional approach of the connection between the governance of logistics development and the governance of inland ports in urban regions, the paper empirically analyses the inclusion of inland port spaces and institutions within Parisian metropolitan logistics strategies. Based on a qualitative methodology (policy documents and semi-structured interviews), it shows that inland port spaces and institutions take part in every metropolitan logistics policies. They constitute one of the few policy tools for both implementing regional planning and developing urban logistics sites in order to spatially (re)organize logistics facilities and activities. At the same time, inland port infrastructures are identified as strategic assets for a metropolitan agenda of economic competiveness, aiming at increasing port regionalization. In this perspective, inland port institutions contribute to the metropolitan governability vis-à-vis logistics issues but, finally, do not permit to regulate logistics sprawl.}

This paper constructs a four-tier reverse logistics network model, which includes ELV sources, collection centers, remanufacturing centers and dismantlers. Meanwhile, this paper also develops a mixed integer linear programming mathematical model and solves the problem using the global optimization software Lingo. The optimization results of a real case in Xi’an prove the validity of the model in both present normal demands and increasing demand situations in the future. The total logistics network and the environmental costs are both reduced, and the utilization rate of the dismantling center is improved. The location and capacity rating strategies in dismantling centers have key effects on the total cost in the logistics network that are far beyond other decision variables. The supply capacity of the key facilities in Xi’an’s ELV recycling network is far greater than the level of demand, causing a serious waste of resources. Hence, the layout model of an industrial park can help to reduce the total cost of the reverse logistics network if the dismantling center has a high utilization rate.}

abstract = {In 2016, Microsoft released the mixed reality (MR) head-mounted display (HMD) HoloLensTM. As augmented reality (AR) devices, the HoloLensTM can enrich the user’s perceived environment with virtual information. However, Microsoft does not consider the HoloLensTM as AR device, but as the first MR device, since it has some additional features compared to competing AR devices. Especially to mention is the possibility to interact with virtual objects and vice versa. This paper shall provide an insight about the application potentials of MR in the field of production and logistics. For this purpose, we present the findings of a literature review about the current state of research concerning the application of Microsoft HoloLensTM in the field of production and logistics. Furthermore, we present a small HoloLensTM application, which we have developed to evaluate the capabilities of the device. Several persons tested our application and gave us feedback concerning the utility and usability of the HoloLensTM. We provide an evaluation of the user experiences at the end of the paper.}

abstract = {Multi-stage resource leveling problem in sharing logistics network is a multi-objective optimization problem, which is strongly non-deterministic polynomial hard in open loop environment. In this paper, we attempt to develop a logistics task-resource allocation model for this problem, which not only considers the total cost and duration for sharing logistics network, but also refers to the resource efficiency intra-stage and stability inter-stage for resource providers. As the defects of slow convergence, weak local search and easy-to-precocious in traditional algorithms, an improved multi-objective artificial bee colony algorithm is developed with adaptive neighborhood rules. The process of algorithm improvement involves: (I) an adaptive moving step size in population update strategy instead of random step size and (II) an adaptive weigh updating method with multiple neighborhood search rules in local optimum. The results show that the improved algorithm can effectively solve multi-stage resource leveling problem proposed in this paper, compared with traditional artificial bee colony algorithm, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II and multi-objective particle swarm optimization, and can obtain a better non-dominated solution set with multiple metrics for algorithm.}

They provide the benefits of reducing solid waste, creating new jobs, and generating income from the sales of re-manufactured products and savings in raw materials. At the same time, their design is more challenging in comparison with forward supply chains because of hardly predictable reverse flows of EOL products. Conventional approaches to address the uncertainty are usually risk-oriented and do not consider eventual opportunities. In order to overcome this drawback, we propose to use the R* criterion in the decision making process in a context of complete ignorance with a discrete set of equally possible scenarios. This criterion integrated in a new lexicographic algorithm is used in order to take the Decision-Maker’s (DM) behavior into account in different ways regarding if the uncertainty is considered as a risk or as an opportunity. Its performances are evaluated on the case study of facility location problem in reverse logistics.}

The problem under study is denoted as the vehicle routing problem with multi-compartment vehicles which are to operate from a single depot to visit customers within the chosen time period by minimizing major operational costs.

abstract = {Real-time state detection in logistics supports efficient control and monitoring of logistics processes. State detection is performed via sensor-based technologies that are attached to logistics objects or to elements of the logistics system. Besides other technologies, image-based sensor systems have already proven their potential to fulfill this task. Within the development of image-based sensor systems, a suitable combination of processing modules (e.g. cameras, lighting, algorithms, hardware) have to be found with which state variables can be detected in a specific process environment, which is often characterized by non-cooperative measurement situations, such as poor lighting conditions. This complexity results in a high number of test cases, which are typically performed in laboratory environments within a prototyping stage. This approach involves considerable effort. In order to mitigate this problem, the paper proposes the application of virtual commissioning of image-based information systems for state detection in logistics processes. Virtual commissioning can simplify data acquisition of different sensor configurations and subsequent early evaluation of algorithmic models for state detection in logistics processes and thus accelerate design, implementation and testing of image-based information systems for specific environments. However, major challenges such as the variety of tools and expert roles and the integration of virtual commissioning into a process model remain and must be solved in order to establish virtual commissioning of image-based information systems in logistics.}

A three-stage Stackelberg game model is formulated for the optimal subsidy design for the government, accounting for the decisions of government, suppliers (owners of off-site construction yards), and customers (entities that buy precast concrete from the suppliers). The government has two objectives: one is to maximize the use of precast concrete produced by regional yards and the other is to reduce green-house gas emissions from the transport of precast concrete. A number of properties of the three-stage Stackelberg game framework have been analyzed. We find that an inappropriately designed subsidy scheme may decrease the use of precast concrete produced by regional yards and increase green-house gas emissions from the transport of precast concrete, compared with a no-subsidy benchmark.}

In this context, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), also known as delivery drones, and ground autonomous delivery devices (GADDs) show great potentialities. The objective of this paper is to provide strategic insights to adequately match these autonomous technologies with some given characteristics of cities and help define relevant decision variables. Using continuous approximation equations, the operations costs as well as the externalities induced by a) GADDs in association with an urban consolidation center (UCC) and b) truck-launched UAVs are estimated. Then, the developed mathematical formulations are applied in two different use cases: a part of the Paris suburbs (France) and the historical center of Barcelona (Spain). In less dense and larger service regions such as the Paris suburbs, truck-launched delivery drones seem more suitable to reduce the carriers’ operations costs. In denser neighborhoods such as the Barcelona historical center, GADDs are expected to be more economically profitable. In both use cases, GADDs would generate less externalities. Finally, considering the high uncertainty of some input parameters, a sensitivity analysis of the models is done.}

In this paper, the significance of commodity and vehicle suppliers and guaranteeing prevention of shortage via on-time supplying of each relief commodity by the suppliers is emphasized by suggesting the integration of carrier selection and supplier selection for developing contractual agreements in humanitarian logistics. For this close relationship to be described, a scenario-based two-stage stochastic programming model for the establishment of joint decision-making in preparedness and response phases is developed so that a contract can be created on the quantity of reservation of both commodities and vehicles by the suppliers, as well as the transmission of the reserved commodities in the form of commodity purchase and vehicle rent in the response phase. An efficient two-step solution technique is suggested as a solution method for real scale problems, the effectiveness of which can be seen through the results. To illustrate the applicability of the model, a case study is suggested. The application of the model is discussed via numerical studies as well as a sensitivity analysis.

Adversarial strategies could hinder the actions of the forces within operational areas by inferring and anticipating a military’s potential mission objectives including military logistics and transportation activities. Thus, this research investigates the potential ways of incorporating two military deception strategies into the military logistics decision making process: (i) falsifying signifies including empty convoys on routes on which commodities are being hauled, and (ii) hiding refers to concealing routes in the logistics network. Assuming that the adversaries can monitor the shipments in the transportation network, we develop a two-stage integer linear programming model that quantifies the sufficient amounts of each deception needed to deceive the adversaries. In addition, the mathematical model accurately captures several other military logistics challenges, such as satisfying the demands for military commodities at destinations subject to limited capacities at supply points, deciding the best route option, and respecting the time limit constraint. However, the two-stage model is non-convex and therefore, reformulation and linearization steps are applied to convert it to a convex single-stage model. Due to the computational complexity in solving the single-stage model for realistic-size instances, two greedy heuristics are developed that can efficiently solve those instances. Moreover, the computational experiments reveal that the greedy heuristics obtain near optimal solutions when compared to the solutions of the smaller instances solved to optimality via a commercial solver.}

However, one of key challenges in designing the simulation system could be how to reasonably determine simulation model input and build a bridge to link battle damage model and battle damage laws knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel knowledge-oriented modeling method for influencing factors of battle damage in military industrial logistics, integrating conceptual analysis, conceptual modeling, quantitative modeling and simulation implementation. We conceptualize influencing factors of battle damage by using the principle of hierarchical decomposition, thus classifying the related battle damage knowledge logically. Then, we construct the conceptual model of influencing factors of battle damage by using Entity-Relationship approach, thus describing their interactions reasonably. Subsequently, we extract the important influencing factors by using social network analysis, thus evaluating their importance quantitatively and further clarifying the elements of simulation. Finally, we develop an agent-based military industry logistics simulation system by taking the modeling results on influencing factors of battle damage as simulation model input, and obtain simulation model output, i.e., new battle damage laws knowledge, thus verifying feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that this method can be used to support human decision-making and action.}

But still different B2C E-commerce companies make different decisions in the way of providing logistics service. To find out the reason behind this difference, we in this paper intend to investigate the impacts of logistics resource sharing on the participators. Specifically, we study the logistics resource sharing problem between two B2C E-commerce companies. One company has self-run logistics (SRL) system (we denote it as SRL provider) and shares its logistics to the other company which does not have self-run logistics system but resorts to third-party logistics (3PL) previously (we denote it as SRL receiver). We build and solve two Hotelling models to examine the impacts of the sharing on the optimal prices and profits of two companies, consumer welfare, and social welfare. We find that three parameters are critical in determining the impacts, i.e., the degree of differentiation between two companies, customers’ logistics benefit, and logistics provider’s logistics efficiency. We find that the sharing always benefits the logistics receiver company, but benefits the logistics provider company only when both the degree of differentiation between companies and the logistics provider’s logistics efficiency are relatively high. We also find that the sharing benefits customers only when both the degree of differentiation between the two companies and the customers’ logistics benefit are relatively large. However, the sharing always improves the social welfare.}

The evolution of technologies, Industry 4.0 applications, and societal changes, such as ageing workforces, are transforming operations processes. This transformation is still a “black-box” for many companies, and there are calls for new management approaches that can help to successfully overcome the future challenges in production and logistics. While Industry 4.0 emerges, companies have started to use advanced control tools enabled by real-time monitoring systems that allow the development of more accurate planning models that enable proactive managerial decision-making. Although we observe an increasing trend in automating human work in almost every industry, human workers are still playing a central role in many production and logistics systems. Many of these planning models developed for managerial decision support, however, do not consider human factors and their impact on system or employee performance, leading to inaccurate planning results and decisions, underperforming systems, and increased health hazards for employees. This paper summarizes the vision, challenges and opportunities in this research field, based on the experience of the authors, members of the Working Group 7 (WG7) “Human factors and ergonomics in industrial and logistic system design and management” of the IFAC Technical Committee (TC) 5.2 “Manufacturing Modelling for Management and Control". We also discuss the development of this research stream in light of the contributions presented in invited sessions at related IFAC conferences over the last five years. The TC 5.2 framework is adapted to include a human-centered perspective. Based on this discussion, a research agenda is developed that highlights the potential benefits and future requirements for academia and society in this emerging research field. Promising directions for future research on human factors in production and logistics systems include the consideration of diversity of human workers and an in-depth integration of Industry 4.0 technologies in operations processes to support the development of smart, sustainable, human-centered systems.}

The manuscript objective is to identify the most appropriate and benefit methods for their implementation to solve vehicle routing problem (hereinafter as VRP) at a City logistics scale and related optimization operations; i.e. to seek the shortest possible routes during the customer’s delivery activities. In this matter, it is important to state that relevant distribution (pick-up and delivery) tasks can be expressed in a form of graphs on specified transport networks, and thereby use the individual techniques of graph theory. The particular transport network, as the basic concept of transport theory, is defined as a finite set of vertices and edges representing the infrastructure of roads of a network. Each network must be coherent, i.e. there must be at least one path for each vertex pair connecting these two vertices. Each network edge as well as vertex is defined by a certain value or set of values, for example, the edge length, the time it takes to pass, the amount of work that needs to be done on the edge, etc.}

In practice, businesses may operate return policy (and may reuse products and material) in an effort to increase customer loyalty and recover assets. In this paper, a reverse logistics EOQ model is studied. The inventory problem of when to order and how much quantity to order when there is reverse flow of items into the system is addressed in the form of profit maximisation. To find the optimal solution of the model (a nonlinear maximisation problem), the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions for the objective function are presented and the square-root formulae for the firm’s order size and price are derived. A simple algorithm is proposed for a search of the optimal solution. To illustrate the applicability of the model, some numerical examples are given.

abstract = {Côte d’Ivoire produces about 42 percent of the world’s total Cocoa but processes only 30 percent of the total production. A large part of the country depends on the commercial benefits of the Cocoa production and supply chain of it. In this paper, we develop a simulation model that assess the performance of the logistics of the Cocoa supply chain in Côte d’Ivoire. The simulation model shed light on the potential of improvements in the logistics of the Cocoa supply chain by identifying inefficiencies, bottlenecks, and blockers that hinder the productivity and performance of the Cocoa supply chain. Results from simulations show that reduction of checkpoints along the roads will increase productivity by 30 percent, while the value of beans in the Port will increase 3 percent and of butter 5 percent. Investing in improving secondary and tertiary roads will increase the productivity by 9 percent and value by 1 percent while investing in improving road infrastructure and checkpoints will raise the productivity by 27 percent and the value by 3 percent. The results suggest that a combination of reducing the checkpoints with the investment in secondary and tertiary roads will increase productivity while at the same time the pollution will be reduced importantly. The results also suggest that the switching from only producing beans to butter should be accompanied with the increase in productivity otherwise the value at the market would not be sensitive. Other important results are also presented in this paper, together with suggestions for improvement in order to optimize the logistics of Cocoa supply chain, and increase the profitability of the Cocoa sector, and hence the living conditions and wellbeing of the farmers in the country.}

The second stage is the development of interfaces for processing heterogeneous data on parameters of a transport stream and the environment and their integration into a single system. Development of algorithms for managing flows of unmanned and manned vehicles in transport corridors. The third stage is connected with software development and testing of proposed algorithms. The paper presents integrated results of the SWOT-analysis which was carried out in three directions: the current condition of the RITLS in Russia; the RILTS influence on all target groups of service users; the RILTS influence on the development of the region and national economy as a whole. There are some results obtained after finishing the first stage. To finish the second stage of the RILTS creation successfully the algorithm of control of access of vehicles to the high-speed transport corridor is proposed. The key result of the RITLS module development is the intelligent system of managing unmanned and manned vehicles which is regularly updated. This system includes aggregated modules for solving separate tasks and knowledge base to ensure uninterrupted management and monitoring of the road network. Besides there are algorithms for managing transport flows by simulation methods in existing software environments.}

To apply the robot logistics system in the hotel industry, the capacity and operation design should be prepared adequately. For that, a mathematical model-based optimization technique is used to decide the number of robots with the concept of minimizing total investment cost and to derive the optimal job assigning with the purpose of maximizing total covered jobs. In addition, a numerical example is performed to validate the proposed mathematical model and the sensitivity tests are examined to reflect the random features.}

Logistics services providers use sensor technologies such as GPS or telemetry to track and manage their shipment processes. Additionally, they use external data that contain critical information about events such as traffic, accidents, and natural disasters. Correlating data from different sensors and social media and performing analysis in real-time provide opportunities to predict events and prevent unexpected delivery delay at run-time. However, collecting and processing data from heterogeneous sources foster problems due to the variety and velocity of data. In addition, processing data in real-time is heavily challenging that it cannot be dealt with using conventional logistics information systems. In this paper, we present a hybrid framework for processing massive volume of data in batch style and real-time. Our framework is built upon Johnson’s hierarchical clustering (HCL) algorithm which produces a dendrogram that represents different clusters of data objects.}

abstract = {Purpose
More and more cities struggle to provide acceptable air quality and noise levels for their inhabitants. At the same time, urbanization is continuing, as is the need for supply with groceries in cities. Another ongoing trend is the growth of online shopping of groceries. Increase of online shopping in other areas, e.g. clothing, has resulted in augmented transport demand due to deliveries and returns. Therefore, an approach is needed to uncouple grocery supply related transport demand from emissions augmentation. This is only possible though, if transportation efficiency is further improved and if lower emission technologies (noise and fumes) are applied, e.g. electric vehicles. With limited data available on urban commercial transport as well as on e-mobility, it is difficult for both logistics providers and politics to prepare for these developments and understand their implications. Focusing on the German market and using the test case of a renowned logistics service provider who trialed e-vehicles for commercial transport, this paper discusses potential shifts in grocery shopping habits, maps out perspectives, prerequisites and challenges for a shift to electric vehicles for their distribution and derives recommendations for industry and politics based on the findings.
Research approach
The data basis of the research is as follows: Whereas the analysis of online grocery shopping had to be based mainly on secondary data, analysis of the potential and prerequisites for the use of electric vehicles for their distribution are based on real-life test cases. This is due to the fact that primary data on commercial transport and on logistics structures of groceries in particular is difficult to obtain in general, and especially in Germany. This is due to the tight data protection in Germany, not allowing to trace employees unless union representatives and employees have agreed. Furthermore, businesses do not want to disclose their logistics structures. The real-life test cases of electric vehicles for grocery deliveries were piloted by Hellmann Worldwide Logistics in Germany and were accompanied by the researchers. The synthesis of the insights gained build the basis for a discussion, whether e-mobility is the right approach to cope with the impact of the trends of urbanization and online grocery shopping and which further developments are needed for reducing grocery-logistics related emissions.
Findings
The analysis reflects the following aspects and findings: status-quo and trends of online groceries sales in Germany motivation for and experiences made within a real-life test case of use of electric vehicles by a renown logistics service provider in Germany implications from the findings of the test cases and their relation to online grocery sales identification of perspectives, prerequisites and challenges for the successful introduction of electric vehicles for the distribution of online sales, in particular online grocery sales
Research impact
Limitations experienced during the research and challenges encountered build the basis for the identification of further research fields needed in order to be able to develop and conceive sustainable urban logistics concepts.
Practical impact
Findings are included in the logistics service provider's involved endeavors to further reduce their emissions. In particular, in the context of an upcoming trial phase for innovative urban distribution structures in Bremen, Germany.}

Under the Belt and Road Initiative, the development of foreign trade demand in inland regions is stimulating the demand for inland cross-border logistics network functions. The role of dry ports in constructing cross-border logistics networks has attracted the attention of inland governments. The new dry-port-based cross-border logistics networks in Chinese inland regions began to expand rapidly, but due to the lack of operational planning and coordination, the current network efficiency is not yet well regarded. This paper focused on this new cross-border logistics network, which connects the maritime logistics network with the inland cross-border logistics network through dry ports, and studied the organizational optimization problem of inland import and export goods in different network scenarios through the application of a bi-objective mixed integer programming model using the adaptive-weight Genetic Algorithm (awGA) as a solution method. Real experiments showed the effectiveness of the method proposed by this paper. It is a new but very necessary research perspective that provides recommendations for the improvement and efficiency of inland cross-border logistics functions.}

Their computational methods are given as well. Based on the fuzzy entropy theory, an operation entropy model of production-logistics systems is developed to measure the operational efficiency of production logistics. In the case study, two operation order parameters under different conditions are calculated using the evaluation indexes and the operation entropy model developed to accurately compare the level of operational efficiency of the workshop before and after implementing cellular manufacturing. Finally, the result demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.}

abstract = {The fast-growing practice of e-commerce implies a strong increase in parcel deliveries, which in turn creates significant pressure on last-mile city logistics. Due to the important role the city transportation plays in energy use and greenhouse gas emission, effective last-mile solutions in cities must be developed to contribute to sustainability and a cleaner world economy. Crowdsourced delivery as an emerging “sharing economy” initiative can be an effective tool to mitigate the problems emerging from the last-mile city logistics. To valorise the benefits of crowdsourced delivery, a transition towards a hybrid city logistic system is required where crowdsourced delivery and the conventional delivery networks are closely integrated. Due to the lack of theoretical guidelines for crowdsourced delivery integration, this research develops a conceptual framework to facilitate last-mile city logistics transition adopting the multi-level socio-technical transition theory as the basis. The core of the conceptual framework is the “five basic principles” to be followed by stakeholders when designing intervening niche innovations at the current stage of system transition. To demonstrate the usability of the conceptual framework, an illustrative discrete event simulation study with specific settings that fits in with the current status of last-mile city logistics is conducted. Results show that incorporating crowdsourced delivery as a supplement to the conventional delivery network, following the five basic principles proposed by the conceptual framework can reduce the last-mile logistic costs. Moreover, the offline participation rate plays a key role in ensuring the feasibility of the new hybrid last-mile model. To conclude, the developed conceptual framework has a great potential of improving last-mile delivery in the era of e-commerce and having a critical scale of potential deliverer pool is the prerequisite for the successful application of crowdsourced deliveries.}

Reverse logistics play an important role in the adoption and implementation of circular economy concepts in supply chains. It is defined as “sequence of activities required to collect the used product from the customers for their disposition to either reuse or repair or re-manufacture or recycle or dispose of it”. Disposition is one of the crucial decisions which may greatly affect the reverse logistics performance from sustainability perspective. It also plays an important role in improving the operational efficiency of the reverse logistics. The objective of this study is to explore the reverse logistics in context of Indian electronics industry and examine the effect of disposition decisions on Triple Bottom Line (TBL) i.e. economic, environmental, and social performance of reverse logistics. Hypotheses related to disposition decisions and TBL performance was developed. A survey instrument was prepared and was sent to seven hundred organizations from the Indian electronics sector. Over all 208 responses were found suitable for the research. All the necessary statistical analysis was carried out to ensure the reliability and validity of the questionnaire. Partial least square path modelling technique of structural equation modeling has been used for testing the research hypothesis. Measurement model had shown sufficient data fit for the modelling. Partial least square path modelling results reveal that effectiveness of disposition decisions is positively associated with TBL performance. The article contributes to the few studies available on improving the reverse logistics performance. Findings will be useful for managers in managing reverse logistics in effective manner.}

The LTL problem is escalated by the increase in small and individualized shipments, which are partly attributed to a paradigm shift towards customized products and services. In overcoming the LTL problem, one goal is to utilize idle slots in vehicle trucks to reduce logistics costs; reduce harmful emissions (CO2), and; improve utilization of physical logistics assets. The realization of this goal requires smart logistics networks that can link shippers and en route carriers (drivers), using a Connect on the Go (ConnGo) modus operandi. To this end, the present paper proposes the ConnGo as an approach for Self-organizing Logistics Networks (SoLN) in LTL. The paper goes further to examining unforeseen issues related to the accuracy of information communicated by shippers. The SoLN approach stands on principles of artificial intelligence to link heterogeneous shippers and en route drivers. In its application, the approach is useful in many areas, such as developing countries where industrial and agricultural products flow in reverse (order) direction.}

Simulation experiments are also conducted to validate the theoretical results, to show the evolution, and to analyze the sensitivities to parameters, based on the data of the steel industry that we collected from China.

Although industrialized building systems can potentially simplify the production process, there is usually a high level of complexity in ETO production systems, such as uncertainty in client demands, short lead-time, overlapping between project stages, and resources that are shared among different projects. In this context, logistics management plays a key role in terms of achieving project goals related to cost, time and safety. This research work proposes the combined use of principles from the Lean Production Philosophy and Building Information Modeling (BIM), as a mechanism to cope with the complexity involved in those types of projects. Although these can be regarded as two separate approaches for improving the performance of production systems in the construction industry, there are evidences that there is much synergy between them. This paper reports the development of a logistics planning and control model for site assembly of ETO prefabricated building systems using BIM 4D modeling. The main theoretical contribution of this research work is the understanding of the synergies between Lean principles and BIM functionalities that are applicable to site logistics management, providing an example of how this body of knowledge can be expanded. This investigation also provides some practical contributions on how to carry out logistics planning and control at different hierarchical levels, with the support of BIM 4D modeling, aligning this process with the Last Planner System of production control. Design science research was the methodological approach adopted in this investigation, and the proposed model was developed and tested in empirical studies carried out in a steel fabricator company that designs, fabricates and assemblies steel structures.}
