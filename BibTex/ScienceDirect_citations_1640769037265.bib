abstract = {While logistics comprises an important part of tunneling costs, it is generally not considered a lever of performance but rather a constraint to a project's progress. This study presents some insights on how smart technology can impact the tunneling industry. The impact is even greater because of the complexity of the tunneling supply chain, and smart technology could help support this process. Finally, we discuss how the nature of the tunneling industry invites stakeholders to develop a common understanding of the project prior to construction to successfully deploy smart technology during the use or maintenance phase.}

abstract = {In most European countries the various interfaces between logistics and freight transport (such as interaction between different actors, transport planning, transport process etc.) are poorly identified and coordinated. Hence, valuable research, technology and innovation (RTI) potential at mentioned interfaces is not boosted sufficiently. As a consequence, close-to-market innovation is oftentimes missing. To encourage stakeholder's thirst for knowledge and consequently a further development of innovation and technology in logistics and freight transport, the complexity at those interfaces, the current transport and logistics market as well as the most important stakeholders and gaps in R&D in Austria have been analysed. First of all, interfaces between logistics and freight transport “per se” have been analysed. Therefore, theoretical approaches (such as state-of-the-art analysis of different logistics theories, analysis of goods-/transport-/logistics markets, models of applied logistics, function- and sector analysis, methods for interface analysis etc.) and explorative sectorial analysis were combined. Supply Chains of different complexity in automotive industry, vegetable industry, CEP-providers and recycling industry represented the study areas, which have been evaluated empirically (expert interviews with key stakeholders of the four branches). All interfaces identified in those branches were merged within a broad matrix; differentiated into vehicle-, infrastructural- and informational-sided interfaces to reveal gaps in RTI. Altogether, 57 comprehensive logistical interfaces affecting all four supply chains could be revealed. At each interface, one or more RTI gaps were identified and corresponding RTI – potential was deduced. The paper will show and explain the specific topics with most relevant RTI-potential at interfaces between logistics and freight transport in Austria. The results were used by the Austrian Ministry for Transport, Innovation and Technology for designing new call texts for a tender in the programme “Mobility of the future” in the year 2015 and 2016.}

This requires the development and/or integration of new or existing technologies such as intelligent food packages or wireless sensor networks to improve monitoring capabilities during logistics and sales and consumption, allow interaction with consumers, and improve the reuse or recycling of food packages. In this review paper, an extensive overview is provided of computer systems that are used in the logistics and post-logistics phase of a food package’s life cycle and that to a certain extent integrate the aforementioned technologies. These systems offer the perspective to improve the efficiency of logistics operations on food packages to reduce food loss, better inform consumers through food packages, and support package reuse and recycling.

Given the urgency of effective climate change mitigation, renewable energy diffusion needs to accelerate drastically. Among the many constraints to renewable energy diffusion, the important role of the supply chain is often overlooked. Therefore, this article addresses the role of the supply chain in the renewable energy diffusion process. Using the offshore wind energy sector as a case, this article presents an analysis of supply chain readiness to ascertain the role of the supply chain in the green transformation. Examining Europe and China mainly within offshore wind logistics, the research findings show that this segment of the supply chain constitutes a key bottleneck for accelerated deployment. For Europe, the key findings indicate that legislation for offshore wind beyond 2020 is necessary to ensure the implementation of the required investments in logistics assets, transport equipment, and personnel. In China, the key findings indicate that the Chinese supply chain of wind energy is mainly organized around onshore wind. Key bottlenecks exist, predominantly in logistics, and this article identifies specific areas of the supply chain where international collaboration and knowledge transfer may speed up deployment.}

We aim to minimize both procurement spending and the expected operational cost under logistic uncertainty. Given the computational burden of solving the resultant stochastic integer program for real-world instances, we develop an improved stochastic branch-and-bound (SBB) algorithm embedding with Tabu search method. We conduct the numerical study to verify the superiority of the proposed algorithm. We also offer managerial insights to practitioners and policy recommendations to municipal governments based on the numerical study results.}

Construction and demolition wastes (C&D wastes) management poses serious challenges to the government and private sector in terms of the environmental damages and potential gains due to recycling these types of wastes. On the other hand, considering the triple bottom line in reverse logistics network design problems simultaneously is an issue that has gained little attention in previous studies. Therefore in this research we propose a multi-period multi-objective mixed integer linear programming to design and plan a network of reverse logistics under uncertainty for recycling C&D wastes in which the objectives are represented as profit and social impact maximization and environmental effect minimization. In this paper the network design problem with stochastic demand of recycled products and rate on investment is regarded. In order to cope with the uncertainty in the model, we consider a risk averse two-stage stochastic programming, where we specify the conditional value at risk (CVaR) as the risk measure. We also apply off-site and on-site separation as two common method for segregating C&D wastes. Appropriate numerical is conducted to learn the effects of crucial parameters on the model and gain managerial insights as well.}

Some conclusions about the impact of parameters on the optimal number of FLSPs are proposed with numerical analysis.

Further, we show that there is a barrier to the co-creation of value when services get close to core activities in-store operations.}

abstract = {With the increase of the concern from the public for environmental pollution and waste of resources, the value recovery through reuse, repair, remanufacturing and recycling from the end-of-use (EOU) and end-of-life (EOL) products have become increasingly important. Reverse logistics is the process for capturing the remaining value from the EOU and EOL products and also for the proper disposal of the non-reusable and non-recyclable parts. A well-designed reverse logistics system will yield both economic and environmental benefits, so the development of an advanced decision-making tool for reverse logistics system design is of significant importance. The paper presents a novel multi-product multi-echelon stochastic programming model with carbon constraint for sustainable reverse logistics design under uncertainty. Compared with the previous stochastic optimization models in reverse logistics system design, which mainly focuses on the expectation of the optimal value, this paper, however, emphasizes on both optimal value expectation and its reliability in decision-making. Due to this reason, a multi-criteria scenario-based risk-averse solution method is developed based on a latest research in order to obtain the optimal solution with high level of confidence. Later in this paper, the application of the model and the augmented solution method is illustrated and the managerial implications are discussed through the numerical experiment and sensitivity analysis. The result of the study shows that the model can be used for providing decision-makers with a deep insight into the relationship between profit and carbon emission requirement, understanding and resolution of the infeasibility caused by capacity limitation, the use of flexible manufacturing system in reverse logistics, and proper use of the government subsidy as a leverage in reverse logistics design.}

The survey focus on logistic operations and transport decisions affecting the city logistics. In the studied cities we found that there is lack of emphasis on urban logistics and urban freight transport planning. The survey indicates that the missing focus on logistic activities is due to lack of co-ordination among actors involved in urban logistics, and often insufficient dialogue between city authorities and private actors who operate in the cities. Representatives from the industries do not always understand the municipal planning processes and on which level of bureaucracy the plans are accomplished. To solve challenges a suggestion related to urban logistics and collaboration among private and public actors is to develop structured Urban Logistic Plans. A part of such plans should be the involvement of all stakeholders in the exploitation and processes of development. The stakeholders must also be involved in policy development and strategic planning processes. The survey indicates that congestion and access to centrally located loading and unloading zones are the biggest problem for freight transport in Norwegian urban areas. From the industry, there is a request that loading and unloading zones must be incorporated as part of land use plans. It was also stressed that local authorities must include plans for goods deliveries in line with services from taxi and public transport in sustainable urban mobility plans (SUMPs).}

Logistics index for ‘customs processes’ significantly associated with the less energy prices while logistics index for ‘tracking and trace consignments’ substantially increases fossil fuel energy consumption. Logistics ‘competence’ index have a differential impact on environment, on one hand, it substantially reduce the burden of fossil fuel energy consumption, while on the other hand, it’s significantly increases carbon emissions. Logistics ‘international shipments’ increase fossil fuel energy in a region.

The service and transport sectors are traditionally assumed to have a smaller environmental impact than manufacturing sectors. Nevertheless, some service sectors, such as the logistics industry, consume natural resources and generate contaminants, and thus need to address more efforts on environmental management. Environmental issues have also become an important element of environmental management and strategies which require commitment to the natural environment via voluntarily implemented green initiatives in logistics companies. In response to that, it is worth studying the factors which have the important impact on green initiatives for logistics companies.}

The MIP model reflects the interdependencies between inbound transportation, outbound transportation and instore logistics as well as capital tied up in inventories and differences in picking costs between the warehouses. A novel solution approach is developed and applied to a real-life case of a leading European grocery retail chain. The application of the new approach results in cost savings of 6% of total operational costs compared to the present assignment. These savings amount to several million euros per year. In-depth analyses of the results and sensitivity analyses provide insights into the solution structure and the major related issues.}

abstract = {During the last decades, reverse logistics and reuse of products have received growing attention as profitable and sustainable business strategies. Looking at the agrifood distribution sector, every day thousands of agrifood stores throw away large quantities of food product no longer suitable for sale. This “waste product”, in the majority of cases, could still find new uses as animal feed or fertilizer. The return flow of food product is a typical problem of reverse logistics. This study proposes a new bi-modular scheme for managing the process of collection of “food waste” resulting from the agribusiness distribution sector and its subsequent distribution to livestock farms and collection centers located in the area of interest. The proposed management scheme consists of two modules: - module 1: to cluster the observed area into convenient collection sectors by means of clustering algorithms; - module 2: to identify optimal retrieval routes within each cluster by using Vehicle Routing models. The province of Cagliari in Sardinia (Italy) has been identified as test area. An extensive data collection process has been performed in order to collect the information necessary to portray the existing scenario. The following businesses have been recorded: grocery stores and supermarkets with at least 400 sqm of retail area, livestock farms with at least 200 heads of cattle, feed mills. A number of variables concerning location, type, size and demand data have been collected for each recorded unit.The management scheme has been implemented in a software platform and successfully applied in the test area. The outcome provides useful insights to stakeholders and suggests avenues for further research in the area in order to develop a more general and intuitive tool for managing reverse logistics processes in agrifood chains.}

In this environment, city logistics service providers (CLSP) have to fulfill deliveries in a cost-efficient and reliable manner. To ensure cost-efficient routing while satisfying promised delivery dates, information on the expected travel times between customers needs to be considered appropriately. Typically, vehicle routing is based on information from shortest paths between customers, to determine the cost-minimal sequence of customer visits. This information is usually precomputed using shortest path algorithms. Most approaches merely consider a single (shortest) path, based on a single cost value (e.g., distance or average travel time). To incorporate information on travel time variation, it might be of value to consider alternative paths and more sophisticated travel time models such as Interval Travel Times (ITT). In this work, we investigate the incorporation of alternative paths into city logistics vehicle routing. For this purpose, we compare our approach to classical shortest path approaches within a vehicle routing problem. Our approach considers a set of alternative paths and incorporates ITT. Experiments are conducted within an exemplary city logistics setting. Computational results show that the consideration of alternative paths allows to select better paths with regard to a trade-off between efficiency and reliability when travel times are varying.}

Yet, in the logistics industry, there are several vaguenesses, such as deciding on key indicators and determining interrelationships between performance indicators. In order to resolve these vaguenesses, this paper first presents the stakeholder-informed Balanced Scorecard (BSC) model, by incorporating financial (e.g. cost) and non-financial (e.g. social media) performance indicators, with a comprehensive approach as a response to the major shortcomings of the generic BSC regarding the negligence of different stakeholders. Subsequently, since the indicators are not independent of each other, a robust multi-criteria decision making technique, the Analytic Network Process (ANP) method is implemented to analyze the interrelationships. The integration of these two techniques provides a novel way to evaluate logistics performance indicators from logisticians' perspective. This is a matter that has not been addressed in the logistics industry to date, and as such remains a gap that needs to be investigated. Therefore, the proposed model identifies key performance indicators as well as various stakeholders in the logistics industry, and analyzes the interrelationships among the indicators by using the ANP. Consequently, the results show that educated employee (15.61%) is the most important indicator for the competitiveness of logistics companies.}

These practices are widely adopted by industries through reverse logistics partners. However, the evaluation and selection of the reverse logistics partner is a matter of concern which needs a very grave decision, involving complexity due to presence of numerous associated factors. In addition, it is hypothesized that the decision makers might be inconsistent to some extent in their views and preferences that affect other dominant constituents. Consequently, incomplete and inadequate sort of information may occur among various selection criteria, which is termed ‘multi-criteria decision making’ (MCDM) problem. The goal of the present study is to discuss an integrated model based on fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) for evaluation and prioritization of selection criteria and fuzzy technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (FTOPSIS) for the selection and development of reverse logistics partner. This study is an attempt to present a genuine concern of Indian electronics industry using an integrated approach to demonstrate the application of the proposed framework as well. In this study two stage sensitivity analyses are performed to get further insight of evaluation and selection of RL partner and verification of robustness of the model. This study aims to provide a significant contribution to electronics organizations in evaluation and selection of third party RL partner while achieving efficiency and effectiveness in RL practices.}

This study uses shadowing and practice theory to explore the nature of manager competence in logistics and supply chain management. The results suggest that logistics and supply chain managers use business managerial, generic, and behavioral competences in practice rather than supply chain management expertise. Although the existing literature depicts competences as discrete and factor-based, the findings further reveal how managers use combinations of competences that create synergistic effects. The findings imply that the level of competence in practice extends beyond the sum of individual competences. In particular, company experience is a distinct key competence that managers constantly use in combination with other competences, and thereby has a significant effect on manager competences. The results produce four propositions for future research.}

Secondly, according to the physical and chemical characteristics of cotton, the fire risk of cotton logistics warehouse is analyzed, and the fire hazard sources are identified. Thirdly, Event and Fault Tree Analysis (EFTA) is used to explore the disaster mechanism of cotton logistics warehouses to obtain disaster reducing factors. In the end, based on the above analyses, a set of fire prevention measures against the cotton logistics warehouse are put forward. The result shows that the probability of moisture absorption and heat release is the highest of all causes of smoldering fire, so it is essential to control the temperature below 343K and the humidity below 70% when keeping in storage. Lacking of spaces between shelves is an important factor leading to the spread of fire. In the process of fire fighting, water supply is the key factor, so appropriate water storage facility for fire-fighting is necessary before the establishment of the cotton logistics warehouse.}

This paper discusses results from other studies and demonstrations that were published on electro mobility in city logistics in the last three years, as an update of an earlier state of the art review. Next, we present recent narratives based on the more than 100 electric freight vehicles (EFVs) deployed in the European project FREVUE and the experiences of TransMission in using four battery electric Cargohoppers to perform their urban deliveries in Amsterdam. Over the years the attention shifted from a focus on the limitations of EFVs in comparison to conventional vehicles, such as the limited range, towards the question how to better adapt the operations to deal with the EFV characteristics. Although, the business case for using EFVs, in comparison to conventional vehicles, is still suffering from high vehicle purchase price and uncertainty about its residual value, the use of EFVs in daily operations shows that in the majority of cases the current generation of EFVs have a good technical performance. Companies using EFVs are generally satisfied with these vehicles. Obviously still a number of barriers has to be levelled, but large scale EFV usage seems more feasible than before.}

For the city logistics distribution system, as a significant energy-consuming and pollutant-emitting sector, energy saving and emission reduction are very meaningful especially for megacities like Beijing. With rational hypotheses and parameter design, meanwhile considering the deployment of low-carbon resources, a novel carbon tax-constrained city logistics distribution network planning model is proposed. The model is a bilinear non-convex mixed integer programming and is reduced to a pure linear mixed integer programming through proper linearization. To verify the effectiveness of the model, an empirical study is conducted on a city logistics operator in Beijing and the popular commercial optimization suite IBM ILOG CPLEX is adopted for optimization purpose. Through analysis of the optimization results and comparison with traditional optimization models, it is found that the proposed model can help the city logistics distribution operator save up to 9.2% of operational cost during a full service cycle, and meanwhile cut down its carbon dioxide discharge by around 54.5% or 2135 metric tons at most.}

One of the key factors ensuring a high level of the process realization of the machine supervision is the right procedure of machine spare parts availability management. This work aims at developing a model of machine spare parts categorization. For the evaluation of the significance of spare parts in the correction process, the criteria connected to the machine corrective measures performance and logistics have been adopted. The proposed parts categorization, and determining the importance of a spare part in the machine corrective processes will have a substantial impact on reducing the time of a failure removal. Additionally, the adopted evaluation criteria in the area of logistics will have a considerable effect on the purchase lead time of spare parts as well as on reducing the costs related with their purchase and maintenance.

The demand at each retailer is uncertain but sensitive to retail price; unexpected production disruption may occur at the source. Buyback and revenue sharing contracts are implemented in the proposed model and the associated contract parameters are designed so as to coordinate the decentralized supply chain. The participating entities’ strategic decisions which increase the profitability of the whole supply chain are determined. It is observed from the numerical study that production disruption and TPL service have significant impacts on supply chain’s performance, and the effects of buyback and revenue sharing contracts tend to emerge indifferent for relatively high probability of disruption.}

A holistic view of the coherency between the approaches in terms of logistics and project performance, taking into consideration the external influence of weather, is provided through analysis of actual projects in the North Sea region. Case study findings reveal the major factors to be pre-assembly, vessel load, and the distance to shore. We suggest a pre-assembly strategy comprised of a minimum number of components for installation onsite and a maximum number of turbines to be loaded on a vessel. These findings are especially important for the new wind farms being positioned further offshore. We show by means of a case study, with specific characteristics and weather conditions, that the appropriate strategies can be arrived at by using a simulation-based decision-support tool we developed.}

But, collection, sorting/testing, recovery and redistribution are assumed as the basic four activities in reverse logistics. Unfortunately, many researchers assume reverse logistics by its literary meaning and plan the reverse logistic activities and take decisions based on the forward logistics or supply chain principles. There is hardly any academic research on the performance evaluation and decision variables for reverse logistics. This paper aims at developing the various activities, decision variables and performance indicators based on the four basic activities under reverse logistics. The three basic questions – who will collect from the customer, what is to be done on the collected products and where to send after recovery – interlinked with the activities at collection, sorting/testing and recovery centres will provide the basic activities, decision variables and key performance indicators of the reverse logistics. The location and capacity of various centres, types of networks, various recovery options, various methods of collection, and seamless integration with the forward logistics are the key decision variables. The performance indicators will be developed based on the activities and actions between the activities so that the performance indicators can be associated with the reverse logistics. It is expected that this conceptual framework of activities, decision variables and performance indicators will help the managers working in reverse logistics to take better and informed decisions.}

abstract = {Previous research has shown that Logistic skills are a basic requirement for employment and career development within the Humanitarian Logistics (HL) field. These skills requirements are changing in various logistics functions, groups and cultures. At the same time increasing global disasters are adding to the challenges that are adversely affecting the HL supply chain. Skills of the logisticians are therefore a necessity to effectively manage the supply chain in a disaster. It is vital to research in to the area of HL, considering the recent issues that are being faced after every disaster in Sri Lanka. A number of researches have been carried out in finding skills of the humanitarian logisticians at global level. However, as to date there has been limited discussion on the skills of humanitarian logisticians in the Sri Lankan humanitarian field. In this research a Factor Analysis (FA) was conducted in order to find the skills of humanitarian logisticians in Sri Lanka. Skills which were identified earlier by researchers were further tested in order to find the applicability in the local HL landscape. We have identified deferent set of component than in the previous studies. Results will assist the training and recruiting humanitarian logisticians. Additionally, this paper also indicates future research requirements to the field of HL.}

abstract = {The responsible management of product return flows in production and inventory environments is a rapidly increasing requirement for companies. This can be attributed to economic, environmental and/or regulatory motivations. Mathematical modeling of such systems has assisted decision-making processes and provided a better understanding of the behavior of such production and inventory environments. Therefore, this paper reviews the literature on the modeling of reverse logistics inventory systems that are based on the economic order/production quantity (EOQ/EPQ) and the joint economic lot size (JELS) settings, so as to systematically analyze the mathematics involved in capturing the main characteristics of related processes. The literature is surveyed and classified according to the specific issues faced and modeling assumptions. Special attention is given to environmental issues. In addition, there are indications of the need for the mathematics of reverse logistics models to follow current trends in ‘greening’ inventory and supply-chain models. Finally, the modeling of waste disposal, greenhouse-gas emissions and energy consumption during production is considered as the most pressing priority for the future of reverse logistics models. An illustrative example for modeling reverse logistics inventory models with environmental implications is presented.}

The biorefinery scenarios include small scale (175dt/day)-SS, medium scale (520dt/day)-MS and large scale (860dt/day)-LS. These scenarios are compared against the following logistical resources (1) harvest area and contracted fields, (2) logistics equipment fleet and the workforce to run this fleet and (3) intermediate storage sites and their biomass inventory levels. To this end, the IBSAL-MC simulation model is applied to a corn stover logistics system in Southwestern Ontario. The obtained results show (1) the harvest area and the number of contracted fields increase by 65% and 78% from the SS scenario to the MS and LS scenarios, respectively, (2) the average biomass delivered costs are estimated to be $82.09, $87.49 and $93.75/dry tonne in the SS, MS and LS scenarios. The increase in the capital costs to develop a dedicated logistics equipment fleet are estimated to be far greater than the increase in the delivered costs as the size of the biorefinery increases. The upfront capital costs are estimated to be $6.72, 21.83 and 35.51 million in these scenarios. To run the logistics equipment fleet efficiently, 37, 136 and 235 well-trained operators are required in the SS, MS ad LS scenarios, respectively, and (3) the inventory level and the land requirement for storage in the MS and LS scenarios are estimated to be 225% and 425% greater than those of the SS scenario. The sensitivity analysis indicates that the logistical resources are highly sensitive to corn yield and farm participation rate. Overall, this study shows the importance of considering the size of the required logistical resources and the associated level of logistical complexity in evaluating the economic viability of a biorefinery project.}

This is exacerbated by interdependency of city logistics activities, decision making with limited information and stakeholders’ preference for personal objectives over system efficiency. Accordingly, the key to understanding the causes of inefficiency in the city logistics domain is understanding the interaction between heterogeneous stakeholders of the system. With the capabilities of representing a system in a natural and flexible way, agent based modelling (ABM) is a promising alternative for the city logistics domain. This research focuses on developing a framework for the successful implementation of the ABM approach for the city logistics domain. The framework includes various elements – a multi-perspective semantic data model (i.e. ontology) and its validation, the development of an agent base model using this ontology, and a validation approach for the agent-based model. Conclusively, the framework shows that a rigorous course can be taken to successfully implement agent based modelling approach for the city logistics domain.}

This research work evaluates the adequacy of BEV in urban logistics in Lisbon, based on a real-world application. Vehicle second-by-second data was collected during regular operation of both the internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV) and the BEV (for 7 and 3months respectively). The results demonstrate that BEV allows maintaining the same operation patterns, regarding the number of kilometers travelled per day (60km), recharging time (6h), and vehicle dynamics (average speed of 16km/h for ICEV and 19km/h for BEV). When comparing the energy impacts of shifting to electric mobility, the BEV allows reducing vehicle usage energy consumption by 76% and by 57% when considering the energy production stage. The logistics operations performance was not affected by the vehicle technology shift, since the operational requirements of the service were maintained and no issues on electric autonomy and recharging periods were observed, confirming the suitability of this vehicle technology for specific urban logistics applications.}

abstract = {In the changing competitive landscape and with growing environmental awareness, reverse logistics issues have become prominent in manufacturing organizations. As a result there is an increasing focus on green aspects of the supply chain to reduce environmental impacts and ensure environmental efficiency. This is largely driven by changes made in government rules and regulations with which organizations must comply in order to successfully operate in different regions of the world. Therefore, manufacturing organizations are striving hard to implement environmentally efficient supply chains while simultaneously maximizing their profit to compete in the market. To address the issue, this research studies a forward-reverse logistics model. This paper puts forward a model of a multi-period, multi-echelon, vehicle routing, forward-reverse logistics system. The network considered in the model assumes a fixed number of suppliers, facilities, distributors, customer zones, disassembly locations, re-distributors and second customer zones. The demand levels at customer zones are assumed to be deterministic. The objective of the paper is to maximize the total expected profit and also to obtain an efficient route for the vehicle corresponding to an optimal/near optimal solution. The proposed model is resolved using Artificial Immune System (AIS) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithms. The findings show that for the considered model, AIS works better than the PSO. This information is important for a manufacturing organization engaged in reverse logistics programs and in running units efficiently. This paper also contributes to the limited literature on reverse logistics that considers costs and profit as well as vehicle route management.}

So here, a single-product System Dynamics (SD) model of the supply chain with RLSR is developed. The product lifecycle with its inherited uncertainties, such as the length of the product lifecycle, pattern of the product lifecycle, and residence index, is adopted by considering interrelated sustainability dimensions. Efficient flexible capacity planning is established as a policy option by considering a social responsibility fund from the premium price that is contributed by consumers. The Taguchi design of experiment is used for analysis of the numerical simulation. Finally, the significance with its power is measured to show the power of the relationship between policy and uncertainty for the sustainability dimensions performance. These features will be used to analyze the impact of capacity planning on product lifecycle for performance on sustainability dimensions in RLSR by using an SD approach. The findings show that the policy parameters have an effect on any measured performances and uncertainties with some conditional exceptions. These findings reveal three interesting facts regarding RLSR due to the considered model features. First, the economic performance is a result of a direct influence of policy. Second, the environmental performance results from the indirect effect of the policy. Third, the social performance is the performance that is hardest to influence by policy. Therefore, the findings underscore this paper's contributions to the relatively limited academic knowledge on the examination of the impact of behavior in reverse logistics as a social responsibility due to capacity planning and the product lifecycle with its inherited uncertainties. These contributions offer managers a better understanding of the relationship between capacity planning, product lifecycle with its inherited uncertainties, and sustainability performance. This better understanding will lead to better capacity planning to tackle product lifecycle with its inherited uncertainties for sustainable RLSR.}

The main objective is to determine the location and the capacities of the sorting facilities to ensure compliance with the new regulation and prevent the wood from being massively landfilled. We formulated the problem as a mixed-integer linear programming model (MILP) to minimise the total cost of the wood recycling process collected from CRD sites. The main contribution lies in the consideration of important uncertain factors such as supply sources locations, the available quantity of recycled wood at the collection sites, and the various quality grades of the collected wood. A scenario-based analysis is conducted to evaluate the impact of uncertainties on the RLN design. In addition, the proposed MILP model has been applied for a case study in the CRD industry within the province of Quebec, Canada. The results of this study show the adjustment of the reverse logistics network leads to the reduction of wood recycling cost due to the improved efficiency of sorting facilities and the economy of scale achieved under the new policy. Moreover, sorting facilities are now located near the CRD collection points and not close to landfilling site as for the actual situation. Finally, the study demonstrates that efforts to obtain accurate information about the supply sources locations and the expected wood quantity recovered from sorting facilities will guarantee a more efficient RLN redesign.}

To develop effective intervention strategies for postharvest losses reduction, it is important to first understand the core logistics and quality control activities that could affect postharvest losses in these chains. In this study, a diagnostic tool was developed and used to assess the implementation level of core logistics and quality control activities, the vulnerability of the system due to the context in which it operates, and the actual postharvest losses. Based upon a literature review, the context characteristics are divided into product, process, organisation, and supply chain environment characteristics to assess the context vulnerability to postharvest losses. The identified core logistics activities are planning on the amount of fresh produce to harvest and process, selecting issuing policies, selecting mode of transportation and type of vehicle, and vehicle scheduling and routing. Maturity determination at harvest, deciding on harvest moment, harvesting, packing, and storage practices, use of grading standards, package material, temperature monitoring during storage and transportation, and equipment maintenance are the core quality control activities identified. The tool was applied to three groups of farmers operating in a tomato supply chain in Zimbabwe. The major findings are that commercial farmers recorded lower postharvest losses (1%) as compared to subsistence farmers (3%), the context for commercial farmers is less vulnerable to the generation of postharvest losses as compared to that for subsistence farmers, and logistics and quality control activities for commercial farmers are implemented at a more advanced level. The tool provides differentiated assessment that allows users to identify improvement opportunities to achieve higher performance for the activities and to reduce context vulnerability.}

Both entities however remain divisions of the state-owned company Transnet, which is also the sole owner and operator of the national freight rail system. Competition concerns gave rise to the establishment of the Ports Regulator of South Africa, mainly to achieve economic regulation and equitable access in the ports sector. The question posed in this research is whether further reform is required at present, or whether addressing other aspects impacting on international trade logistics costs require more urgent attention. The research results suggest that port authority and terminal charges contribute only 10% to international trade logistics costs (16% if maritime shipping costs are excluded). We believe that collaboratively confronting port congestion, bureaucratic import/export requirements and the hinterland feeder system could unlock much more value for stakeholders in the short to medium term, instead of allocating scarce resources to the administrative task of port reform per se, without a clear understanding of the role of ports in the total national logistics system. The fact that it is challenging to engineer, and act upon, such an understanding should not be a deterrent to at least attempt a strategic infrastructure view for a national economy, which does not exclude the possibility of further reform in the longer term.}

abstract = {This present contribution examines by means of a discrete event and agent-based simulation the potential of a joint use of resources in the installation phase of offshore wind energy. To this end, wind farm projects to be installed simultaneously are being examined, the impact of weather restrictions on the processes of loading, transport and installation are also taken into consideration, and both the wind farm specific resource allocation and the approach of a resource pool or resource sharing, respectively, are being implemented. This study is motivated by the large number of wind farms that will be installed in the future and by the potential savings that might be realized through resource sharing. While, so far, the main driver of the resource sharing approach has been the end consumer market, it has been applied in more and more areas, even in relatively conservative industries such as logistics. After the presentation of the backgrounds and of the underlying methodology, and the description of the prior art in this context, the network of the offshore wind energy installation phase will be described. This is the basis for the subsequent determination of the savings potential of a shared resource utilization, which is determined by the performance indicators such as the total installation time and degree of utilization of the resources. The results of the simulation show that weather restrictions have a significant effect on the installation times and the usage times of the resources as well as on their degree of utilization. In addition, the resource sharing approach, has been identified to have significant savings potential for the offshore wind energy installation.}

In a supply chain, carbon emissions are seen right away from the procurement of raw material till the delivery of finished goods. To address and optimize carbon emissions in the procurement and logistics problem, a multi-period, multi-part, multi-supplier and multi-carrier low carbon procurement and logistics model is proposed. The problem is modeled for a carbon trading environment using MILP (Mixed Integer Linear Program). The proposed MILP integrates the procurement and logistics decision in a carbon trading environment of a supply chain. The model considers the carbon emissions caused during ordering, holding and transportation and provides an optimal decision for low carbon procurement and logistics. Proposed MILP is validated through randomly generated deterministic data of four different sets of time varying parameters representing characteristics of procurement and logistics, and is solved with and without the carbon emission constraint. The computational results are encouraging, and significant cost saving is found if the procurement and logistics decisions are taken in carbon trading. To demonstrate the applicability of proposed model, a real case study from a manufacturing industry is also carried out. However, the proposed model is equally applicable to any procurement decisions.}

As a result, the location of spare parts used for maintenance operations is equally distributed throughout the country. Therefore, to increase the productivity of the maintenance teams, it is essential to bring the spare parts closer to their destination, in order to reduce the travel time of the maintenance teams to a minimum in order to reach the intervention address. In this regard, the use of a third party logistic provider is hypothesized, who autonomously manages the shipment and storage of spare parts at transitory warehouses near the first intervention of each team’s day. The advantage of increased productivity of the maintenance teams is contrasted by the cost of shipping spare parts and the need for careful planning of in field operations. A basic general model was therefore developed to allow a preliminary assessment of the investment project. The goodness of the theorized model was then validated through its application to a case study, through an analysis of the differential costs between current model and new logistics management, evaluating the investment project with the typical techniques of the payback period (PbP) and net present value (NPV). Results obtained confirm the profitability of the theorized model, and the results obtained from the feasibility study are strongly in favor of the adoption of the new 3PL model for the studied company and so, generalizing, could be a winning strategy for all utilities company.}

More than a few studies show that the small and medium sized enterprises (SME) are working on these improvements. Moreover, we believe that trade logistics and supply chain management are needed by emerging countries in order to improve their competitiveness as by obtaining the advantages of globalization they will be able to address shortage issues more efficiently in the entire world. The success in combining international supply chains starts with the capability of companies to move goods across borders faster, in a more consistent manner and cheaper. The Romanian economy aims to join worldwide trends and development, rather than successively joining the Romanian market to the European one and then towards the world market. This paper aims to investigate how logistics can be considered as a tool for developing the activity of small and medium sized Romanian enterprises that in turn will enhance the good organization of the business and create an additional business chance.}

Initially, we propose a mixed integer linear programming model – with a profit maximization objective – for the network design problem. The structure of the product, by way of bill of materials (BOM), is also incorporated into the proposed model in order to analyze the flow at component and material levels. Sensitivity analysis is carried out to study the effects of variations in the values of the input parameters such as product return quantity, unit transportation cost per unit distance, and unit processing cost. The analysis shows that the design decisions of different facilities considerably change even for 5–20%% variations in input parameter values. This led to the development of a refined mathematical model which incorporates variations in the different input parameter values over time. The new model provides a unified design for the entire planning horizon and has been validated with the design of a used refrigerator recovery network.}

As shipping and logistics industry is one of the core industries in Korea, the volume was ranked in the fifth highest in the world. However, shipping and logistics industry of Korea has suffered from default risk since Global Financial Crisis in 2008. This study examines the relationship between the default risk, as measured by the Altman K-Score, and firm value, as measured by the Return on Assets (ROA), of shipping and logistics firms in Korea and compares the impact of default risk on firm value between good financial health firms and poor financial health firms. As the trends of KScores over a ten-year periods, shipping and logistics firms in Korea register weak-to-moderate financial healthy rage. We find that Altman K-Score is significantly linked with firm value and also higher performing firms as measured by the ROA exhibit higher financial health as measured by KScore. Although nine years have been passed since Global Financial Crisis 2008, Korean shipping and logistics industry is still under the financial depression. This study proposes that systematic financial alert system of Korean shipping and logistics industry should be required to decrease default risk reflecting significance of Korean economy.}

This research work aims to strengthen e-waste acquisition from the consumers by determining the psychological determinants of intention to return e-waste. For this, a survey instrument was administered on 750 mobile phone users in India and structural equation modeling was used to analyze the responses. Research findings show that return intention acts as a mediating variable in prediction of return behavior. Further, perceived behavioral control, subjective norms, moral norms, willingness to sacrifice were identified as antecedents to return intention. Given the possibility of increased proportion of e-waste returns through strengthening of behavioral intentions, the study findings and suggestive inputs may help the firms in fulfilling their “Extended Producer Responsibility”.}

abstract = {Background
In recent years, marketplaces in the darknet emerged where vendors and customers can exchange illicit drugs and other goods on digital platforms by using hidden internet services. The main thesis of this paper is that in an online environment, different practices for building trust and reputation emerge that stabilise market processes.
Methods
Qualitative and quantitative data from a recent German project on conventional (offline) small-scale drug dealing as well as qualitative case studies on four online vendors operating on Agora market are used to explore alternative practices for building trust and reputation. They also explore the use of violence and logistics established on cryptomarkets in comparison to traditional dealing. To analyse the data we applied qualitative content analyses.
Results
For conventional commercial illicit drug dealing on various kinds of markets, trust between buyer and seller is a crucial issue, often emphasized by restricting deals to well-known persons. While this typically includes face-to-face contact, the opposite is true with online drug trading. It is characteristic of cryptomarkets that the parties involved in a transaction know neither the personal identity nor the physical location of one another. This is realised by using aliases, anonymising software, and cryptocurrencies for payments. Violence typically only plays a role in traditional drug dealing, but mostly, if at all, just as a latent threat for potential rule-breakers. Processing a transaction anonymously includes escrow services for the buyers, which makes trading more reliable, although they cannot completely prevent scamming. Furthermore, online drug marketplaces usually offer a customer feedback system that allows customers to rate vendors and review products. A positive vendor feedback helps building reputation and trust in such an online environment. With regard to logistics, most conventional small-scale dealers restrict their acts of selling to private surroundings to avoid encounters with law enforcement. In cryptomarkets, the purchased drugs are delivered by traditional postal services, sometimes to false addresses or to someone else's name to conceal the identity and address of the buyer.
Conclusion
On virtual drug markets practices of building trust, conflict resolution and logistics is constantly evolving. They offer improved security solutions on the one hand while on the other hand scamming and fraud seem to be widely used on both online and conventional drug markets.}

In order to provide key insights to the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the World Health Organization (WHO) supply chain hub – as well as other players, including national EPI – a landscape analysis study was conducted from September 2015 to February 2016. This is a cross-sectional survey taken by 43 countries that combines qualitative and quantitative approaches. Data was collected through a desk review, consultation, interviews, and distance questioning. References and guidance were used to determine and specify the underlying mechanisms of NLWGs. The key findings are:•Mandate of NLWG commonly declared by countries is improving immunization logistics and supply chain.•Of the 43 countries surveyed, 10 have formal NLWGs, 8 have informal or ad hoc NLWGs, and 25 have none.•The immunization supply chain and logistics (iSCL) decision-making process in countries, regardless of NLWG status, mainly depends on the EPI manager.•In countries with an NLWG, members with logistics and supply chain backgrounds are relatively common; they are mostly from EPI, UNICEF, and WHO.•Almost all NLWGs have terms of reference and primarily operate under EPI governance; however, three NLWGs have standard operation procedures (SOP), and four use monitoring and evaluation tools.•The coordination mechanism of these iSCL activities is mainly built into the immunization Comprehensive Multi-Year Plan (cMYP) and annual EPI plans, and organized by EPI/Immunization Coordination Committee (ICC).•Most countries that participated in this survey expressed their technical requirement for improving the function, positioning and influence of the immunization logistics working group, and capacity building for the group’s members.This study has provided a general overview of the status of NLWGs for immunization in various countries. Based on the key insights of the study, technical assistance needs have been identified, and immunization partners will be required to help countries create and reinforce their NLWGs.}

This paper is to determine the critical quality parameter(s) in the cold chain logistics through the real time monitoring of the temperature fluctuation implemented with the Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), and the correlation analysis among the various quality parameters. The assessment was conducted through three experiments. Experiment I indicated that the temperature have a large fluctuation from 0 °C to 30 °C, and the critical temperatures could be determined as 0 °C, 5 °C, 10 °C, 15 °C, 20 °C, 25 °C and 30 °C. Experiment II described that the firmness and moisture loss rate, whose Pearson correlation coefficient with the sensory evaluation were all greater than 0.9 at the critical temperatures determined in Experiment I, could be the critical quality parameters. Experiment III illustrated that the critical quality parameters, firmness and moisture loss rate, could be reliable indicators of table grapes quality by the Arrhenius kinetic equation, and results showed that the evaluation model based on the firmness is better to predict the shelf life than that based on the moisture loss rate. The best quality table grapes could be provided for the consumers via the easily and directly tracing and controlling the critical quality parameters in real time in actual cold chain logistics.}

They are caused by competitive rising of all railways in CIS countries and Baltic States. Experience of the countries with developed economy shows us, that reforming processes should be lead with receiving possibility system-wide effect from the individual interconnected subsystems functioning (units of rail transport) like unified system. Systematic approach to the justification the process of reform and development of the railway sector provides the formation of a dynamic model of the individual transport units, consisting of a single organizational – technological structure. This enables the system to be generally aimed at achieving the objectives of its functioning. So, such structure can be considered a major transport system for which is characterized by new properties and characteristics and all separate rail divisions acquire the status of system elements. In order to improve the quality characteristics of the transport process and the efficiency of cargo service, solving management task and logistic system rationalization of the goods delivery can be carried out the basis of multi-criteria methods, taking into account conservation approach. General industry logistic system should consist of the railways, their units, some large railway stations in conjunction with the relevant subsystems cargo. In process of the logistic system centers formation appears a question of managing their organizational structure. In our opinion one of the main factors which must be taken into account in shaping the organizational structure of logistics centers is an opportunity to achieve a high service level with taking in account availability of internal and external constraints. Modern conditions needs to formalize the functioning of large dynamic rail system from the system approach position, which is directed on system-wide optimization (synergistic) effect and takes into account the complex of all participants interests in the transportation process. One of the main limits for this system is a providing of the resources cost reduction (rolling stock, amount of cargo on the route to the consumer, staff etc.) for an assimilation given traffic volumes. From the logistics view point customers needs main services connected with transportation, storage, loading and unloading, warehousing, order processing, inventory management, herewith, services are seen as interrelated and interactive. On the other hand, in this complex are especially important logistics service indicators (service quality, compliance is “just in time”, etc.). Herewith logistic system should take on additional functions, which are accompany transportation, such as packaging, labeling, sorting goods, transportation design, determining the optimal transportation options, control over the movement of goods in transit. To do this, you first need to ensure the absolute safety of cargo; offer the full range of transport services; simplification of goods carriage and tariff system; reducing the delivery time; creation of a powerful and modern information network; clear interaction organization with a motor companies or obtaining of own one for delivery ensuring.}

In terms of level of detail, mesoscopic simulation models fall between object based discrete-event simulation models and flow based continuous simulation models. Mesoscopic models represent logistics flow processes on an aggregated level through piecewise constant flow rates instead of modeling individual flow objects. The results are not obtained by counting individual objects but by using mathematical formulas to calculate the results as continuous quantities in every modeling time step. This leads to a fast model creation and computation. The authors expect that mesoscopic simulation models can help to support decisions on the operational, tactical and strategic level of planning. The paper describes a mesoscopic simulation model of the goods receiving of an assembly plant and compares the simulation results and computation time with a discrete-event model.}

abstract = {Reverse logistics has become an important issue for most of the organizations due to increased flow of product returns and growing concern for the environment, legislation, and corporate social responsibility. Reverse logistics activities include product collection, inspection and sorting, disposition (reuse, repair, remanufacture or recycle), and redistribution of products. One of the important decisions is whether such activities must be outsourced partly or all must be outsourced or nothing must be outsourced. The articles on the selection of third party reverse logistics service providers are abundant but the articles on outsourcing reverse logistics fully or partly are very limited. The proposed study develops a framework for outsourcing decisions in reverse logistics by using graph theoretic approach. The ability of graph theoretic approach to consider interdependencies and maintaining hierarchical relationship among attributes and sub-attributes makes it an attractive approach. The attributes and sub-attributes were selected by combining four traditional balanced scorecard perspectives i.e. stakeholder, internal business process, learning and growth, and finance with triple bottom line aspects of sustainability known as sustainable balanced scorecard. By considering sustainable balanced scorecard based attributes and sub-attributes, organizations can ensure their contribution toward sustainability even after outsourcing the reverse logistics activities. The proposed framework is illustrated by case example of a mobile manufacturing firm. Scenario based alternatives were developed and “outsourcing index” were calculated for all the alternatives by evaluating permanent function using graph theoretic approach. The best alternative was selected based on the “outsourcing index”. The proposed framework will help managers and practitioners in outsourcing reverse logistics decisions.}

Currently, a high amount of time is spent for gathering information during planning and existing knowledge from previous planning processes is scarcely used for future planning. Therefore, this paper presents an approach for predictive inbound logistics planning. Using machine learning, generic knowledge of logistics processes can be extracted and used to predict future scenarios.}

Many decision makers normally specify its location based on their experience due to limited data source; and at the same time, disregard the spatial efficiency of the areas. The objectives of this study are (i) to develop a decision tool that helps store and analyse both primary and secondary data in a systematic manner; and (ii) to apply it for evaluating the spatial efficiency of transport logistics in a regional scale. The development of the decision support system is two-fold. One is the development of knowledge base. The study used the Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) method to develop the decision solutions. To model the MCDM mechanism, various data and indicators related to logistics efficiency were acquired from both local and regional government and non-government organizations, study reports, and corporate studies. The study conducted a questionnaire survey from three expert groups: the academic group, the government officials, and the private companies. The study applied Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) to designate the criteria used for the MCDM model and to determine the weights of each criterion. The second is the development of computer system. This study used the Geographic Information System (GIS) technology to analyse the MCDM model and visualize the spatial data. The proposed spatial decision-making tool embedded in a GIS platform can be a powerful tool to support decision made in case of highly complex spatial data. Such data related to efficiency evaluation can be visualized for the potential, advantages, and disadvantages of each area and can be used for strategic planning, enhancing logistics efficiency in regional areas.}

We model the problem as an area partitioning problem in which a rectangular service area has to be divided into sectors, each served by a single vehicle. The length of the routes, which depends on the dimension of the sectors and on customer density in the area, is calculated using a continuous approximation. The aim is to partition the area and to determine the type of vehicles to use in order to minimize the sum of ownership or leasing, transportation and labor costs. We formulate the problem as a mixed integer linear problem and as a dynamic program. We develop efficient algorithms to obtain an optimal solution and present some structural properties regarding the optimal partition of the service area and the set of vehicle types to use. We also derive some interesting insights, namely we show that in some cases traffic restrictions may actually increase the number of vehicles on the streets, and we study the benefits of operating a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles.}

This model is a multi-period one with the consideration of the period when the patients transfer into the different disease stages, the period when the medical intervention begins and the change of the recovery rate because of the time lag between the two aforementioned periods. Our model can support the decision making process in case of a real anthrax attack and evaluate the important factors, which can have a great impact on the number of casualties.}

A questionnaire survey and two expert groups were deployed. Survey respondents were managers of haulage companies which made up 30% of the 140 active companies. Annual revenue for a firm ranges from Ringgit Malaysia 1.25 million to 5 million. Each firm made an average of 170 trips to the depots daily. The theoretical contributions are the validation of industry-derived integration factors and the unwitting revelation that the stakeholder theory is unfazed by the downside of the agency theory. This surprisingly confirmed depot could still influence hauliers favourably. The practical contributions are the usefulness of the integration factor questionnaire items for future haulage studies, and that depots and hauliers should collaborate to lift national logistics performance.}

The term ‘green initiative’ has been defined as a multifaceted concept which incorporates three perspectives: the managerial perspective (the aim), the organisational perspective (the practices), and the technological perspective (the technological tools). Starting from a systematic literature review, we developed the WH2 framework to identify a taxonomy of green aims, green practices and technological tools that can be used by LSPs to achieve their environmental sustainability (ES) strategies. A web-based document analysis methodology was carried out to investigate the degree of diffusion of green initiatives in 464 LSPs. This methodology was conducted through six main steps: 1) document search; 2) document selection; 3) manual analysis; 4) computer-assisted analysis; 5) confirmation analysis; 6) triangulation of findings. The results highlight that the LSPs investigated tend to plan their ES strategies without setting out in an integrated manner the green aims related to the different typologies of service provided and mainly neglect those related to logistics and management services. As for the green practices, their low level of diffusion shows the attempt of LSPs to combine management and environmental efficiency without a defined ES strategy roadmap. As for the technological tools, the results highlight that these are more commonly adopted than green practices. Nevertheless, LSPs tend to adopt traditional systems instead of collaborative technologies. The results make it possible to identify three main gaps among LSPs: a technological gap, a cultural gap, a managerial gap.}

abstract = {The assessment of emissions caused by logistics operations in general and their allocation to individual customers is a major challenge for logistics service providers. Presently, numerous standards and guidelines exist (e.g. ISO 14064-1, ISO 14065, DIN EN 14040) for the calculation of GHG-emissions caused by logistics processes. Due to missing or incomplete approaches, the assessments as well as regular updates are quite expensive and time-consuming. This endangers in particular the competitiveness of sme logistics service providers who need to gather and provide the relevant information for their clients. To support sme-logistics services providers by calculating and allocating GHG-emissions, a CO2-method kit has been developed, which was implemented in MS Excel. This method kit consists of various demonstrator-tools for each mode of transport and stationary processes in logistics systems. Even complex transport chains can be illustrated with this CO2-method kit as well. Overall, the method kit offers a pragmatic solution for everyday business. The underlying calculation methods determine the energy consumption, CO2- and CO2- emissions, distinguished between Tank-to-Wheel and Well-to-Wheel. Based on the resulting greenhouse gas values, logistics companies can now identify and carry out appropriate measures to reduce their CO2-emissions. The existing method kit is currently extended to include the determination of GHG-emissions of handling operations in multimodal container Terminals. An in-depth analysis of terminal handling operations as well as an analysis of influencing factors on resource energy consumption was needed to develop the CO2-method kit extension. As a first step, the layout and load data were analyzed to picture existing terminal types as well as the distribution of job orders for the observed period. In addition, crane cycle were deconstructed into sub-processes and transferred into standard processes. Following, container, weight and distance classes were defined for the assessment of the power consumption data. The power consumption data was collected by measurement devices attached directly to the cranes. In course of the evaluation the measured values were accurately assigned against the crane movements and processed orders in the period under review. Finally, average energy consumption values for crane cycles were determined for the defined container and distance classes, based on selected indicators. By data analyses, average energy consumption values can be assigned to container handling operations in terminals, taking into consideration of e.g. terminal layouts, container or weight characteristics. Furthermore, the examinations show that the influence of the covered route on the total energy consumption of a crane cycle is slightly higher than the influence of the container weight. Further results and identified dependencies (e.g. influence of the container classes or terminal layout) are shown in this paper. This paper presents results of the research project “Enhancement of the CO2-method kit for an exact determination of environmental effects in terminals”. The aim of the research is to enhance the CO2-method kit with a terminal demonstrator-tool to empower sme logistic service provider to determine GHG-emissions of handling operations in multimodal container Terminals. Therefore, power consumption measurements have been carried out and terminal input data has been analyzed.}

This study establishes a linear optimization model to minimize the total cost of two-echelon logistics joint distribution network. An improved ant colony optimization algorithm integrated with genetic algorithm is presented to serve customer clustering units and resolve the model formulation by assigning logistics facilities. A two-dimensional colony encoding method is adopted to generate the initial ant colonies. Improved ant colony optimization combines the merits of ant colony optimization algorithm and genetic algorithm with both global and local search capabilities. Finally, an improved Shapley value model based on cooperative game theory and a cooperative mechanism strategy are presented to obtain the optimal profit allocation scheme and sequential coalitions respectively in two-echelon logistics joint distribution network. An empirical study in Guiyang City, China, reveals that the improved ant colony optimization algorithm is superior to the other three methods in terms of the total cost. The improved Shapley value model and monotonic path selection strategy are applied to calculate the best sequential coalition selection strategy. The proposed cooperation and profit allocation approaches provide an effective paradigm for logistics companies to share benefit, achieve win–win situations through the horizontal cooperation, and improve the negotiation power for logistics network optimization.}

Further, we investigate literature on modelling municipal solid waste logistics in general. Comparing issues addressed in literature with the identified issues in practice result in a research agenda for modelling municipal solid waste logistics in Europe. We conclude that waste recycling is a multi-disciplinary problem that needs to be considered at different decision levels simultaneously. A holistic view and taking into account the characteristics of different waste types are necessary when modelling a reverse supply chain for MSW recycling.}

abstract = {Logistics distribution center location is an important task in the network optimization of a logistics system. A novel approach of adaptive particle swarm optimization (APSO) algorithm with nonlinear inertia weight and time-varying acceleration coefficient is proposed to achieve distribution center location problem. Mathematic model of logistics distribution center location is established according to assumptions and constraints. Then, average particle spacing as guidance factor of population diversity is employed to establish nonlinear inertia weight and arccosine function is adopted to design nonlinear symmetric acceleration coefficient in order to control the balance of global search and local search for distribution center location problem. To demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, an application example is provided. Experiments show that APSO can slove the location problem of distribution center with better performance..}

abstract = {The best way to organize the logistics of harvesting agricultural crops requires considering not only the fact that agricultural commodities in general are highly perishable, but also the fact that the organizational structure of the agricultural system in question can vary from crop to crop and from region to region within a single crop. This paper develops a model for planning the movement of the crop from farm to processing plant for crops satisfying two conditions: (1) there are multiple, independent producers (farmers), and (2) no significant on-farm storage exists. We will also briefly describe three different but economically significant agricultural systems in the United States: sugarcane in Louisiana, sugar beets in the northern areas of the United States e.g. South Datoka, Minnesota, Colorado, and vegetable harvesting for human consumption, and will argue that these systems fit the two conditions of our model. We will also briefly explain why several other significant agricultural systems do not fit these two conditions and hence require alternative modeling techniques. Finally, we demonstrate that the model is computationally tractable by introducing new datasets based upon the sugarcane industry in Louisiana. This choice was driven, not only by the fact that the datasets can be constructed entirely using publically available information on the sugarcane infrastructure in Louisiana, but by the fact that this particular organizational structure also appears in both the sugar beet and vegetable processing industries.}

This paper develops a new two-stage stochastic network flow model to help decide how to rapidly supply humanitarian aid to victims of a disaster within this context. The model takes into account practical characteristics that have been neglected by the literature so far, such as budget allocation, fleet sizing of multiple types of vehicles, procurement, and varying lead times over a dynamic multiperiod horizon. Attempting to improve demand fulfillment policy, we present some extensions of the model via state-of-art risk measures, such as semideviation and conditional value-at-risk. A simple two-phase heuristic to solve the problem within a reasonable amount of computing time is also suggested. Numerical tests based on the floods and landslides in Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil, show that the model can help plan and organise relief to provide good service levels in most scenarios, and how this depends on the type of disaster and resources. Moreover, we demonstrate that our heuristic performs well for real and random instances.}

Our contribution is threefold: First, we provide research guidance through categorizing literature and identifying major research streams. Second, we discuss applied methodologies and third, we identify future research directions. A systematic approach is undertaken in order to identify the relevant literature from 1998 to 2014. Applicable publications are categorized thematically and methodologically and future research opportunities are worked out. In total, 145 publications are identified and discussed in this work. The literature is categorized into four streams, i.e., (1) Supply and procurement, (2) Inventory management, (3) Distribution and scheduling, and (4) Holistic supply chain management. The use of optimization techniques is constantly gaining importance. The number of respective publications has continually grown and has peaked over the last three years. Optimization has been successfully applied in research streams (1), (2), and (3). Category (4) comprises a rather qualitative research field of literature dealing with supply chain management issues.}

abstract = {There are few studies on the influences of demand disruption on logistics service supply chain (LSSC) coordination in previous literature. Therefore, this paper will discuss an LSSC consisting of a logistics service integrator (LSI) and two functional logistics service providers (FLSPs) with demand disruption. LSI procures the same kind of logistics service capacity from these two FLSPs, sets a unified price and then sells to service market. The demand depends on retail price and service effort level. As different FLSPs may achieve different effort levels, which bring them different order quantities, there is competition on effort level between them. With all these conditions considered, three coordination modes (i.e. decentralized decision-making mode, supplier alliance decision-making mode and centralized decision-making mode) are established and compared. On this basis, demand disruption is taken into consideration and the corresponding decision changes are observed. Some interesting findings are obtained. For example, from the view of service effort level, supplier alliance decision-making mode makes FLSPs achieve lower effort level than decentralized decision-making mode does; from the view of decision robustness, when demand disruption occurs frequently, decisions made under supplier alliance decision-making mode changes less than those made under decentralized decision-making mode. At last, model application is deployed to verify the conclusions with a practical case of SND Logistics Company in China.}

abstract = {To address the growing demand for wood as a renewable resource, a trend that has arisen in recent years is to follow the principle of cascade utilisation and to use wood residues from by-products. The cascading principle represents a method supporting resource efficiency through the sequential use of the remaining quality resources from previous commodities and substances. The logistics concept deserves special attention with respect to the utilisation of wood resources and the cascading principle as logistics processes constitute the largest share of costs. This work considers a logistics network for wood flow for different products in various sectors. Examples include a logistics network for particle board in the material-based sector, pulp and paper production in the chemical sector, and wood pellets production in the energy sector using cascade utilisation and recovered wood. A transportation problem is modelled using a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model, and it is applied to a case study in Lower Saxony using the software CPLEX v12.5. The aim is to minimise the total logistics costs of a logistics network, including those associated with harvesting, chipping, storage and transportation, for several companies in different sectors. UMBERTO, a life cycle assessment (LCA) software, is used to investigate the potential environmental impacts of the optimised logistics network. The approach is applied to three scenarios in Lower Saxony, a state in Germany. The initial results indicate that the total cost of the considered wood logistics network does not change significantly for the cascading scenarios in comparison to that associated with fresh wood, but there would be a substantial reduction in CO2 emissions if cascade utilisation is used in the logistics network.}

This research evaluates efficiency in the relationship between transport logistics performance, as measured by the Logistics Performance Index (LPI), and CO2 emissions from the transport sector. The slacks-based measure (SBM) of the data envelopment analysis (DEA) was used to construct a low carbon logistics performance index (LCLPI) ranking a group of 104 countries that were selected using the available data. The empirical model adopted one input (CO2 emissions for the transport sector) and seven outputs (gross domestic product [GDP] and the six components of the LPI). GDP has been included as a non-discretionary output because CO2 emissions are directly dependent on a country's economic production, while the LPI is a qualifier. To evaluate how the composite index evolved over time, we used an approach that combines the techniques of window analysis and the Malmquist index. Considering the DEA results, the countries that performed best in terms of the LCLPI were Japan, Germany, Togo, Benin, and the United States and the more evolved countries were Luxemburg, Ireland, Lebanon, and Honduras. For the purposes of LCLPI validation and analysis, the performances of the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) countries were analyzed, especially China, which is the world's second largest CO2 emitter. The proposed composite index and the ranking of countries in terms of logistics performance and CO2 emissions can help identify the best performing countries in low carbon logistics.}

Thus, it can be concluded that the development of objective functions fulfilled in a seaport affect the conurbation transport system, including the logistics system for goods in this area. The second factor that affects the cargo logistics system in urban areas is the sectoral structure of cargo transport provided from the seaport as well as to the seaport. The article presents an analysis of the level of development of objective functions in the port of Szczecin and the sectoral structure of cargo transported by land to and from the hinterland of the seaport. The flows of cargo generated by these functions and their share in the Szczecin metropolitan transport system were analyzed. The analysis demonstrated that along with the development of the logistics distribution function, the amount of cargo generated in the seaport area, for which the place of delivery is the Szczecin urbanized area and other urban areas located at a distance of several dozen kilometers, increases. The analysis also showed which areas of the Szczecin conurbation are particularly burdened by cargo generated by the port of Szczecin and what sectoral and logistic solutions should improve the efficiency of cargo flows, both the transit ones and these which are delivered to the area of the city and neighboring towns.}
