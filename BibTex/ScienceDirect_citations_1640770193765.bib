abstract = {Handling concept drift in process mining is one of the challenges tasks to construct the process model. Process model discovery, as the crucial perspective of process mining, should consider concept drift to discover the changes of a business process over time from execution trace. Many previous works have been dedicated to detect the drift using approaches from process discovery. As a matter of fact, there are many statistical parameters involving in the existing approaches that could be a barrier to construct the representative model. Unsupervised learning (i.e., trace clustering in process mining) could be the option to understand the changes of a process through learning the sequential patterns. However, there was a limited study on using trace clustering to detect the concept drift. This study attempts to explore the use of trace clustering techniques (i.e., profiles) to deal with change process discovery as the one of categorization of concept drift in process mining. The results of various trace clustering approaches were compared to the ground truth determined by both domain experts and existing concept drift approach. To verify the results, a dataset from logistics process was used. The case study in logistics process shows that partition-based clustering could be used to understand the concept drift.}

abstract = {Background
Treatment options for childhood cancer have improved substantially, although in many low- and middle-income countries survival is lagging behind. Integral childhood cancer care involves the whole spectrum from detection and diagnosis to palliative and survivorship care.
Methods
Based on a literature review and expert opinions, we summarized current practice and recommendations on the following aspects of childhood cancer in Latin America: diagnostic processes and time to diagnosis, stage at diagnosis, treatments and complications, survivorship programs and palliative care and end-of-life services.
Results
Latin America is a huge and heterogeneous continent. Identified barriers show similar problems between countries, both logistically (time and distance to centers, treatment interruptions) and financially (cost of care, cost of absence from work). Governmental actions in several countries improved the survival of children with cancer, but difficulties persist in timely diagnosis and providing adequate treatment to all childhood cancer patients in institutions with complete infrastructure. Treatment abandonment is still common, although the situation is improving. Cancer care in the region has mostly focused on acute treatment of the disease and has not adequately considered palliative and end-of-life care and monitoring of survivors.
Conclusions
Decentralizing diagnostic activities and centralizing specialized treatment will remain necessary; measures to facilitate logistics and costs of transportation of the child and caretakers should be implemented. Twinning actions with specialized centers in high income countries for help in diagnosis, treatment and education of professionals and family members have been shown to work. Palliative and end-of-life care as well as childhood cancer survivorship plans are needed.}

Each plot of the Betti numbers βi is curve-fitted using a four-parameter logistics model, for characterizing mixing effects. Similarity between adjacent pixels can be quantified by the distance. The β1 of continuous phase decreases linearly at distance ≥ 2, which can be used to determine the threshold for segmentation. Repeated tests with different pixels and methods are conducted to ensure the repeatability and effectiveness of this model. More interestingly, we find that the rapid increase of β1 of bubbles swarm coincides with the evolution of β1 of continuous phase, and the median of difference of β1 between the two phases in the visible window, as a novel metric of flow regime control is obtained and correlated with average volumetric heat transfer coefficient.

In such decisions, managers can find it difficult to select the right device for their company. To address the Smart Watch (SW) selection problem, this article introduces an assessment framework established on a Hesitant Fuzzy Linguistic (HFL) Multi-Criteria Decision-Making technique to collectively consider parameters affecting the eventual decision. Hesitant Fuzzy Linguistic Term Sets (HFLTS) are utilized to integrate choices of decision makers into the decision-making procedure, where their thoughts and ideas about a decision problem can be of an uncertain nature, making it hard to express their assessments with crisp numbers. The proposed method handles the partiality in decision-making processes with a Group Decision Making (GDM) approach. This paper first showcases an integrated HFL Simple Additive Weighting (SAW)-HFL Additive Ratio ASsessment (ARAS) method. The framework’s functionality is then illustrated in a case study about SW assessment. The originality of the paper is based on its evaluation framework using an integrated SAW-ARAS approach in the hesitant fuzzy environment, its research method and case application in the logistics sector. This approach can guide managers and practitioners for an effective SW selection process.}

Moreover, this paper uses network analysis method to study the characteristics of virtual water trade networks. Results show that: (1) the import and export of the virtual water trade among 19 major countries in 2015 increased in varying degrees. Among them, the growth rates of China's import and Russia's export were the highest. (2) The density(average value) and asymmetry(differences between import and export)of the virtual water trade network among the major countries in 2006–2015 increased throughout the whole industry and the three major industries. In comparison with the secondary and tertiary industries, the virtual water trade network formed by the primary industry is denser. (3) The Out-Degree(corresponding to export) and In-Degree(corresponding to import)of countries in the virtual water trade network of the whole industry increased in varying degrees in 2015. Major countries exhibited the largest export and import within the primary industry, except for Japan and South Korea. Therefore, in order to alleviate the contradiction between supply and demand of water resources in various countries, it is necessary to further strengthen the construction of transportation facilities and reduce the logistics cost of trade in industrial and agricultural products, especially the trade cost of agricultural products such as grain, so as to further expand the virtual water import and export trade to expand the import and export trade of the virtual water network further.}

In addition to recommendations on technology support for ecology, Industry 4.0 also suggested decentralization and self-regulation coordination mechanisms. In this paper, a coordination mechanism was examined by focusing on the freshness-keeping effort of third-party logistics service providers (TPLSPs) in a three-echelon cold supply chain. Optimal decisions concerning a carbon trading mechanism were examined based on a comparison of two decision systems: a decentralized system and a centralized system. An incentive scheme was proposed to motivate all three parties in a decentralized system to adopt the coordinated mechanism with self-regulation. The results of numerous experiments show that although an increased eco-friendliness effort would reduce market demand, total carbon emissions, and the supplier's profit, a reasonable revenue-and-cost-sharing contract can improve sales volume and balance the supply chain members' profit. With a coordination model, all members in the supply chain can benefit from Pareto improvement. Other proposals were also examined in the scheme. The results can be implemented into decision making on cold and green supply chain and proved a tool to realize Industry 4.0 from the viewpoint of smart logistics.}

Majority of them are deterministic with the objective to minimise the relevant cost. Motivated by a real-world automotive supplier, this paper proposes a new fuzzy APP model which considers time required to complete operations in the production and warehouse inventory as the main indicator of the performance. The paper includes uncertainties in relevant parameters including customer demand deviations from expected values and production output, as well as uncertainty in production time, time of safety stock storing in the warehouse and time of preparation for delivery to customers. The uncertain parameters are modelled using fuzzy sets generated using historical data recorded in the supplier or based on experience of a logistics management team. Various experiments are carried out using real-world data collected in the supplier to analyse the impact that uncertainty has on APP. It is demonstrated that the developed fuzzy APP model can shorten the time required to perform the production and warehouse operations and improve the performance of the supplier.}

According to definitions logistics is an inter-disciplinary science which improves the quality of business processes and which enables companies to react to demands of a market as well as of a customer faster. Today when a great emphasis is put on the quality and high level of provided services the application of optimisation methods in logistic processes is a necessity. The article addresses the optimisation of transport processes within a logistic chain. Generally, the optimisation methods are more and more frequently utilised to manage logistic chains because their results bring proposals to improve business processes. Advantages of optimisation methods include the reduction of costs of transport charges, storage or production processes. Besides an economic merit of the optimisation process there also increases the efficiency of time needed for logistic operations execution. The article aims to use the information obtained through an analysis of the current state of a selected part of a selected business’s logistic chain to prepare a proposal of measures within transport processes, and subsequently to evaluate them from the economic point of view. In order to achieve the goal the work must be divided into a theoretical-methodological part, and the application part. The aim of the optimisation is focused on a more effective utilisation of transport means, technologies and human resources. The application part contains an analysis of transport routes, and an optimisation using methods of an operational research. The work applies the Nearest Neighbour Methods and Vogel’s Approximation Method. The conclusion of the article presents an evaluation of optimised routes, their economic results and suggestions for business processes improvement.}

Based on the periodic time characteristics of logistics facilities and customers, the optimal solutions provide periodic location decisions and vehicle routing schemes simultaneously in each service period of the planning horizon. Transportation resource configuration is tweaked by enabling resource sharing across multiple service periods to maximize resource utilization in the context of growing emphasis on sustainable development. A bi-objective mathematical model is developed to formulate the 2E-MPLRP to obtain the minimum total operating cost and number of vehicles. A two-stage hybrid algorithm including three-dimensional (3D) k-means clustering and multi-objective improved particle swarm optimization (MOIPSO) algorithm is proposed to solve the 2E-MPLRP. The 3D k-means clustering algorithm is adapted to assign customers to distribution centers (DCs) to receive service in multiple service periods, and the MOIPSO algorithm is then designed to optimize the vehicle routes and find the Pareto optimal solutions. With an external repository strategy and a rapidly decreasing mutation strategy incorporated in the iterative process, the proposed hybrid algorithm performs well in expanding the particles’ searching region and achieving robust optimal results. An algorithm comparison demonstrates the superiority of the proposed hybrid algorithm over other existing algorithms. A real-world case study of 2E-MPLRP in Chongqing, China is conducted, and results show that the proposed model and algorithm are of practical significance in minimizing operating cost, improving transportation efficiency, and contributing to sustainable two-echelon logistics network operations.}

abstract = {Introduction
Rural crashes result in fatality rates twice as high as urban, after accounting for vehicle miles traveled, and those involving farm vehicles tend to be the most severe. Farm vehicle crash interventions have focused on the farm equipment (e.g., lighting and marking) or the farm vehicle operator (e.g., training), despite crashes being most frequently caused by other vehicle driver actions. Community-based campaigns focused on rural drivers have potential to influence driver behavior. The objective of this study was to describe the role, formation, and lessons learned from a community advisory board (CAB) in the development and dissemination of a community-based rural roadway safety campaign.
Methods
The CAB provided campaign input through quarterly meetings and email. The campaign had three main CAB and crash data-informed messages: 1) Slow Down, 2) Leave More Space, and 3) Avoid Passing. The CAB led campaign activities to publicize the message, distribute swag, and organize event logistics. To evaluate CAB effectiveness and inform future community engagement efforts, we conducted in-depth, semi-structured telephone interviews with CAB members in July 2020. Interviews were transcribed, coded, and codes were categorized into five main themes.
Results
Overall, CAB membership was described as an overwhelmingly positive experience in terms of the CAB structure, culture fostered among the group, responsibilities, and time commitment. Board members reported successful campaign implementation, gave positive feedback regarding the research team's engagement efforts, and provided valuable recommendations for future campaigns (e.g., adding social media components, expansion of CAB age and industry diversity, and increasing group bonding activities).
Conclusions
Results from this study demonstrate the instrumental role and logistics involved in engagement of community advisors for the development and implementation of a rural roadway safety campaign. Steps and lessons from this study can be applied to other community-level injury and violence prevention topics, with a particular focus on rural communities.}

To optimize the picking location of the roadway stacker when exiting the warehouse, a mathematical function model was established by analyzing the picking strategy of the warehouse delivery operation. The research results showed that the optimization of the cargo space and the optimization of the stacker crane operation route can improve the overall operating efficiency. It is concluded that the model can reduce the cost of goods handling and storage, the time lost in the storage process and handling process, thereby decreasing logistics costs and increasing revenue.}

abstract = {Increasing energy demand and the rising levels of greenhouse gas emissions have increased the necessity of bioenergy and sustainable energy generation. The sustainable bioenergy supply chain is the key to produce sustainable biofuel. This paper points to render an optimization model for planning a versatile and dependable biomass-to-bioenergy sustainable supply chain network in which crop residuals from several agricultural sectors, multi-transportation disruption modes, multi-biorefineries, multi-biogas plants, and multi-market centers are investigated for two bioenergy sources, namely biofuel and biogas. For this reason, supply chain cost optimization, emissions of feedstock transport, processing, and distributing end biofuel to respective markets are utilized. The multi-setup-multi-delivery (MSMD) concept is incorporated and lead time crashing cost is applied to minimize the lead time in this model. The carbon emission costs at all steps and the variable production rate for the production of bioenergy are included within the model. Finally, one small-scale data and another large-scale data of six agricultural areas, four biorefineries, four biogas plants, and six markets are considered to validate the model's usefulness. The model's goal is to show bioenergy's effect to make a sustainable supply chain of biofuel and biogas. The numerical results reveal that the cost of bioenergy production contributed 54.12%, a major extent of the whole cost in biorefinery and biogas plants. The transportation segment is the preeminent initiator of carbon emissions with 83.33% in the entire carbon emission within the whole supply chain. Although, transportation cost contributed 33.09% of the total cost, the multi setup-delivery-multi-delivery policy minimized the whole supply chain cost. The results provide a systematic guideline for developing a sustainable biofuel supply-chain by minimizing cost, various aspects of transportation logistics, and multi-model alternatives under reduced energy effects.}

Manufacturing companies have to cater to their customer’s requirement and shift their production strategy from traditional make-to-stock (MTS) to make-to-order (MTO). Meanwhile, the operation in warehouse is also changed from long term storage to short term cross-docking (CD). Based on a real-life industrial case, it can be found that, in order to achieve overall optimization, the production decision and warehouse decision should be considered simultaneously. In this paper, the specific features of synchronized production logistics scheduling in MTO plant and CD warehouse have been studied and the mathematical model of MTO-CD synchronization has been formulated. A meta-heuristic algorithm HGA-OLS has been proposed in this study. According to the computational experiments and algorithm comparison, the proposed algorithm can solve the MTO-CD synchronization problem effectively. Based on a comprehensive sensitivity analysis, some significant managerial implications have been revealed, which help the decision maker to configure the production resource and warehousing resource in different scenarios.}

abstract = {Over the past twenty-five years a considerable amount of literature has emerged that addresses inland port development in a variety of ways and in different institutional contexts. A recurring issue throughout most papers focusing on inland ports is the wide diversity of definitions, actors, functions, levels and geographies that are of relevance. Therefore, a literature review on inland port development contributes to defining the most important streams in inland port research. Recent studies show that the concept of inland ports is clearly much richer and more diversified than merely an extension of deep-sea ports or port logistics. However, as much of the literature is still largely based on individual case studies and anecdotal evidences, the conceptualization of inland ports has proven to be particularly difficult. Therefore, this review paper presents a systematic and integrated review of inland port studies, covering 80 international peer-reviewed academic journal papers on inland port development between 1992 and 2017. The results show that much attention is paid on inland ports as components of the ‘transport/logistics/supply chain’ systems (follower), while their roles as components of the ‘regional’ systems (leader) are largely overlooked. Such a tweaked focus is likely to pose significant impacts on planning, management, and governance of inland ports.}

To the best of the authors' knowledge, this research is the first to study the Hyperloop from an operational perspective by developing simulation models. We consider the Hyperloop system that is expected to be established between Los Angeles and San Francisco, and the demand for this emerging service is estimated by considering the on-road and flight travels made between these two metropolitan cities. We developed a Define, Measure, Analyze, Design, and Verify (DMADV) approach for (a) conceptualizing the problem and understanding the Hyperloop network operations, (b) gathering data from various sources, (c) developing the simulation model, and (d) obtaining the results and proposing managerial insights for efficient network operation. Sensitivity analysis is performed by varying parameters such as the pod capacity, the number of Hyperloop capsules in the system, commuter volume variability and willingness to use Hyperloop rate, and their impact on the performance measures is studied. Results indicate that the number of Hyperloop pods in the system and the commuter volume variability appear to impact the measures exponentially, and hence intense market research on these parameters is recommended. The proposed simulation model developed under the DMADV approach can be used as a recommender tool by any logistics company that is interested in venturing into the Hyperloop market.}

The methodology is a longitudinal case study of the Swedish intermodal system over a period of 20 years, based on documentation, interviews and action research. We observe the changing roles of the Port of Gothenburg and the Falköping terminal at different time periods. These changes are then discussed and influences identified for this migration and new centralisation inland. The longitudinal approach allows a life cycle perspective which reveals the importance of initial public infrastructure development and then the operational importance of integration between shipper and intermodal transport and terminal provision in controlling the network. The integration of the inland terminal in regional logistics strategies was also found to be important in attracting port flows to be transported via the inland hub to be containerised.}

However, if animal manure is exported to nearby crop fields, to be used as organic fertilizer, pollution can be mitigated. It is a single-objective optimization problem, in regards to finding the best solution for the logistics process of satisfying nutrient needs of crops by means of livestock manure. This paper proposes three different approaches to solve the problem: a centralized optimal algorithm (COA), a decentralized nature-inspired cooperative technique, based on the foraging behaviour of ants (AIA), as well as a naive neighbour-based method (NBS), which constitutes the existing practice used today in an ad hoc, uncoordinated manner in Catalonia. Results show that the COA approach is 8.5% more efficient than the AIA. However, the AIA approach is fairer to the farmers and more balanced in terms of average transportation distances that need to be covered by each livestock farmer, while it is 1.07 times more efficient than the NBS. Our work constitutes the first application of a decentralized AIA to this interesting real-world problem, in a domain where swarm intelligence methods are still under-exploited.}

Gompertz’s model and four common logistics models (Lysack, Bakhayokho, White, and Brouwer and Griffiths) were compared and all fit the data well (Akaike’s differences ≤2). Logistics models estimated the same DW^50 for M. californica, and had similar Akaike’s weight suggesting that they are redundant models. Therefore, multi-model inference was performed individually with Gompertz’s model and each one of the logistic models to estimate an average model DW¯50, resulting in 64.6 cm DW for males and 99.0 cm DW for females in all analyzes. Multi-model inference is a useful tool to estimate the DW^50 of a species with greater reliability, but redundant models must not be combined in this analysis. Thus, in this case it is advisable to perform the multi-model inference with Gompertz’s model and any of logistic models. The information obtained could contribute to the fishing management of the species, which becomes more relevant considering the high percentage of immature individuals of M. californica (53% of males and 90% of females) observed in the landings from Bahía Tortugas zone, Mexico.}

This work improves the understanding of the different challenges and opportunities underpinning travel to school, in general, and WSBs, in particular, by identifying and discussing six thematic areas of critical importance that explain the decision-making behind potential WSB uptake.

Currently, future production systems are envisioned to be digitalized and networked systems bearing names such as “Industry 4.0”, “Manufacturing 2.0”, “Internet of Things”, and many others. These visions share the idea of assigning tasks of production control to “intelligent” objects, such as machines, parts, and products, in order to attain higher flexibility, higher adaptability, and therefore a higher logistics performance. However, limited information and restricted computation capacity may have negative effects: The production system behavior depends on the decisions made by intelligent objects with individual and selfish systems of objectives. This can deteriorate both the stability and the quality of achieved production planning and control solutions. This trade-off situation has led researchers to the belief that a combination of centralized and distributed—as well as of local and global—decision making in control might be the key to an improved and stable logistics performance. However, little is known about the mechanics of these combined, semi-heterarchical control structures. Based on a profound literature review, we compare the approaches and insights from the different research domains in order to classify design decisions that can be made already in the planning phase of a new production system. We take a first step towards the validation of our classification by mapping four paradigms of distributed control into it. Our research can help the designers of future production systems to understand how to avoid the emergence of “myopic” behavior, and it may serve as a basis for creating new control approaches by exploring the design space.}

abstract = {The depletion of nonrenewable energy sources and the resulting climate change from extensive consumption of fossil fuels are two critical issues that have piqued the attention of experts in finding alternate energy sources. The energy extracted from biomass in a biorefinery is a promising energy source that satisfies the energy demand. Biomass that serves as a raw material to a bio-refinery is not very exorbitant; however, logistics adds a significant fraction to its cost. The paper develops a mathematical optimization model by implementing mass and material balance on the nodal points. Two- optimization techniques viz. Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) and Non-Dominated- Sorting GeneticAlgorithm (NSGA-II) are implemented and compared for cost with the non-optimized results. Results show that utilizing the MOGA and NSGA-II significantly reduces the cost of BSN. Compared to a Non-optimized network, MOGA saves $12654 in prices, whereas NSGA-II saves around $70,000 on the same amount of biomass from the three different sources. Researchers may use the blueprints of the technique to help the network operators choose the optimum values of variables that minimize BSN cost.}

This study evaluated risk in food cold chains using a failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) approach and developing improvement strategies. The research comprised two stages: The first stage used surveys to evaluate risk associated with cold chain logistics, and the second used case studies to evaluate improvement strategies. We mailed 566 questionnaires to chilled or frozen food companies including processors, wholesalers, and logistics service providers in Taiwan; the response rate was 9.4%. Receiving, storage, dispatch, and delivery were the four major steps for food quality and safety risk diagnosis in food cold chains. Survey results demonstrated that among the top five food quality and safety risks, the product receiving stage involved three risks, namely long cargo handling time, temperature abuse, and product damage; the dispatch step involved risks of temperature abuse; and delivery involved risks from poor driving conditions. The case study suggested that food quality and safety risks of the cold chain system could be effectively reduced after adoption of improvement plans. These findings demonstrate that the FMEA approach could be used as a preventive tool to diagnose the food quality and safety risks in food cold chain and that risks can be reduced through effective control strategies.}

In order to ensure a high productivity of the AGVs, instead of stopping, they are supposed to circumvent such obstacles if possible. At the same time, the jerk in the circumventing movement must be kept small to reduce wear on the drive system and to ensure that the AGV’s load does not become disordered or damaged. Circumventing obstacles is done using local path planning. Local path planning aims to find a short-term path planning solution in an unknown environment. However, common algorithms for local path planning, like vector field histogram or dynamic window, generate a steering command for the next interval without respect to smoothness of the path. If the generated paths are smoothed, this happens by statistically reducing jitter in the results. Such a smoothing method does not take the jerk into account. This paper shows that paths of G2 differentiability are needed to reduce jerk on a path planning level. A path planning concept for the vector field histogram and for dynamic window and an evaluation method for this concept are shown.}

ShipCLEAN, a newly developed model, introduces a coupling of a marine transport economics model to a sophisticated ship energy systems model – it provides a leap towards a holistic optimization of marine transport systems. This paper presents how the model is applied to propose a reduction in fuel consumption and environmental impact by speed reduction of a container ship on a Pacific Ocean trade and the implementation of wind assisted propulsion on a MR Tanker on a North Atlantic trade. The main conclusions show that an increase of the fuel price, for example by applying a bunker levy, will lead to considerable, economically motivated speed reductions in liner traffic. The case study sowed possible yearly fuel savings of almost 21 300 t if the fuel price would be increased from 300 to 1000 USD/t. Accordingly, higher fuel prices can motivate the installation of wind assisted propulsion, which potentially saves up to 500 t of fuel per year for the investigated MR Tanker on a transatlantic route.}

It has been shown in literature that digitalization technologies can be used to improve lean systems. Nevertheless, there is currently a lack of knowledge about the digitalization of milk-run systems, especially in learning factories. Therefore, this work is introducing a digitalized milk-run system in LEAD Factory, the learning factory of Graz University of Technology.

abstract = {Background
The number of liver transplantations is increasing worldwide, and Brazil ranks in the second position. It has one of the biggest public health care systems, which is responsible for the coordination and financial funding of transplantation procedures. Meeting the demands of such a large system of transplantation has become a challenge, particularly when attempting to minimize costs of scarce and expensive resources. The aim of this study was to investigate the process of donation, the retrieval of organs, and the transplantation itself using engineering methods based on logistics analyses.
Methods
Three steps were used: study planning, data gathering, and data analysis. Researchers surveyed professionals to acquire raw information based on their observations, experience, and knowledge. Then, a data analysis was conducted, putting together all the information gathered during the previous steps. Bias was removed, and conflicting perceptions were resolved in order to have a standard view on the transplantation process.
Results
Data was gathered between 2014 and 2018 and included 5502 liver donors and 2678 (48.7%) patients who received liver transplants organs. A total of 2824 organs were refused because of logistics issues (transport and handling). Interviews of health care professionals enabled the design of a process map in which 4 stakeholders were identified: patient, physician, organ, and information.
Conclusions
The liver transplantation process is analyzed based on a supply chain methodology applying this knowledge and putting together medical and engineering sciences to promote better efficiency and outcomes for the transplantation program. Future studies should focus on the implementation of these ideas aiming to promote optimization gains in any step of the process.}

This study aims to fill in the information gap that various factors might be affecting corporates’ recycling behaviour in two different economies due to environmental inequality by comparing upper-middle-income region (Malaysia) and high-income region (Hong Kong), respectively. A questionnaire survey regarding food waste management according to the Theory of Planned Behaviour was conducted with representatives coming from diverse industries of the hotel, food and beverage, and property management. The questionnaire responses were evaluated based on quantitative structural equation modelling and correlation analysis. The analysis results showed that the model fit the data well, explaining 78% of the variance in recycling behaviour. The findings demonstrated that the most substantial factor on individual’s recycling intention by Malaysian commercial food waste generators was perceived behavioural control, and logistics and management incentives. Subjective norms demonstrated significant and adverse effects on the behaviour of food waste recycling. The variable of administrative incentives and corporate support presented strong positive correlations with moral attitudes as well as logistics and management incentives. Hotel industries from both Hong Kong and Malaysia have a higher acceptance level on human resources regarding food waste recycling. In comparison, food and beverage industries from both regions have a lower acceptance level. These findings could enrich our knowledge of the concerns in establishing regional policy strategies to encourage economic behavioural changes for sustainable development.}

abstract = {As fuel prices increase and emission regulations become increasingly strict, electric vehicles have been used in various logistics distribution activities. Most studies have focused on the electric vehicle routing problem under a deterministic environment, neglecting the effects of uncertain factors in practical logistics distribution. Thus, a novel fuzzy electric vehicle routing problem with time windows and recharging stations (FEVRPTW) is investigated in this study, and a fuzzy optimization model is established based on credibility theory for this problem. In the presented model, fuzzy numbers are used to denote the uncertainties of service time, battery energy consumption, and travel time. Moreover, the partial recharge is allowed under the uncertain environment. To solve the model, an adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) algorithm enhanced with the fuzzy simulation method is proposed. In the proposed ALNS algorithm, four new removal algorithms are designed and integrated for addressing the FEVRPTW. To further improve the algorithmic performance, the variable neighborhood descent algorithm is embedded into the proposed ALNS algorithm and five local search operators are applied. The experiments were conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed ALNS algorithm for solving the presented model.}

Cancer patients with minor children are increasing; however, they do not receive sufficient support.
Objective
This study aimed to investigate the association between loneliness and the frequency of using online peer support groups among cancer patients with minor children.
Methods
A cross-sectional web-based survey was conducted from April to May 2019. Cancer patients with minor children were recruited from an online peer support group called “Cancer Parents.” Individuals diagnosed with cancer and whose youngest children were younger than 18 years were enrolled. Materials included: the UCLA Loneliness Scale version 3 (UCLA-LS), K6 scale, abbreviated Lubben Social Network Scale, and the sociodemographic/clinical characteristics questionnaire. Multivariate logistics regression analysis was performed to determine the factors associated with the high loneliness group (defined as those above the median score on the UCLA-LS).
Results
A total of 334 patients participated (79.9% female; mean age 43.1 years, standard deviation 5.8). The most common primary cancer type was breast (34.1%). The median score of the UCLA-LS was 45 (interquartile range 37–53). The multivariate logistics regression analysis revealed that the high loneliness group was significantly associated with the frequent use of online peer support group less than once a week (odds ratio [OR] = 0.47; 95% CI = 0.26–0.85; P = 0.012), with a smaller social network (OR = 0.78; 95% CI = 0.73–0.83; P < 0.001), and higher psychological distress (OR = 1.16; 95% CI = 1.09–1.23; P < 0.001).
Conclusions
Frequent use of online peer support groups was associated with less loneliness among cancer patients with minor children.}

Approaches to managing the impacts of soil compaction include minimisation (reduce load), remediation (tillage) and confinement (control traffic). Integrated ‘swarms’ of low-mass autonomous machinery have recently been suggested as a means of reducing compaction and an alternative to controlled traffic. In this study, combine and potato harvester machinery relationships were used to predict the specifications of potential low-mass harvesters for use in soil compaction modelling. Results suggested that combine harvester gross vehicle mass (GVM) must be less than 6 Mg to keep the modelled soil bulk density below 1.4 Mg m−3. With this constraint, 6–9 small harvesters (~50 kW) would be required to replace one Class 9 (>300 kW) harvester. A fleet of this size would require access to unloading facilities every 2.5–3 min for the modelled yield conditions. For root and tuber harvesting, which results in a high degree of soil disturbance, no low-mass harvester option was found that would avoid compacting the soil to unacceptable limits. Avoiding soil compaction while maintaining acceptable productivity will pose considerable design and logistics challenges for low-mass grain, root and tuber vegetable harvest machinery. The integration of controlled traffic farming (CTF) and medium-capacity autonomous machines (~10–20 Mg GVM for combine harvesters) may be a better solution for both soil compaction and operational logistics than low-mass swarm technology.}

abstract = {Now more than ever, traditional healthcare models are being overhauled with digital technologies of Healthcare 4.0 increasingly adopted. Worldwide, digital devices are improving every stage of the patient care pathway. For one, sensors are being used to monitor patient metrics 24/7, permitting swift diagnosis and interventions. At the treatment stage, 3D printers are under investigation for the concept of personalised medicine by allowing patients access to on-demand, customisable therapeutics. Robots are also being explored for treatment, by empowering precision surgery, rehabilitation, or targeted drug delivery. Within medical logistics, drones are being leveraged to deliver critical treatments to remote areas, collect samples, and even provide emergency aid.

While previous delivery points optimization researches do not use customer behavior data, we propose new models, integrating with customer behavior data analysis, to optimize collection and delivery points for online retailers. We explore a real customer behavior data and use totally 257,685 users’ records (212,062 records for training set and 45,623 records test set). We first estimate the customer purchase probability by five data mining models. Based on the estimation results, we establish two facility location models to respectively optimize the attended and unattended CDPs locations with the objective of cost minimization. Our numerical experiments make a quantitative analysis of customer service level and location cost. Our results can further help online retailers to decide the suitable CDPs with trading off the consumer service level and the total logistics cost. We make interesting contributions: (i) we analyze real customer behavior data and find that gradient boosting trees algorithm outperform other four algorithms when estimating customers’ purchase probabilities; (ii) We propose a new data-driven method integrating data mining models and facility location models to determine CDP locations for online retailers.}

abstract = {Ensuring access to food for the most vulnerable is one of the objectives of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Rethinking food production and distribution systems in light of this need makes it imperative to limit the environmental burden of food supply chains to meet the increasing demand of a rapidly growing world population. One of the most important problems of food supply chains is food waste, which leads to a huge waste of resources for the production of foodstuffs that end up not fulfilling the function for which they were produced. A powerful strategy to address this problem is the recovery and redistribution of food that is still edible to socially and economically disadvantaged people. In this article Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is applied to the study of environmental burdens and benefits of food redistribution following attributional and consequential LCA approaches. Data on surplus food recovered is collected from local charities and the impact of their activities is compared with that of the treatment of food waste by incineration, anaerobic digestion and composting. All midpoint impact categories of ReCiPe (hierarchist) are considered in life cycle impact assessment of 1 kg of food wasted or donated. The study highlights the great variability of recovered food locally, with respect to quantity and type. The life cycle of surplus animal-based food has the greatest impact (e.g. up to 70% kg CO2 eq/kg in waste treatment scenario). Food donation reduces the average impact of the studied systems (e.g. 1.9 kg CO2 eq/kg net environmental benefit). However, efficient mechanisms of recovery and redistribution are required, in terms of sizing, consumptions and logistics, to ensure a significant environmental improvement over food waste treatment.}

We propose an original approach to solve the orienteering problem based on hybrid control. The continuous state of the system contains information about the navigation toward the next control point. In contrast, the discrete state keeps track of the already visited ones. The control problem is solved using non-standard dynamical programming techniques.}

Focusing on a third-party logistics (3PL) firm’s technology innovations supported by external equity financing, we examine how the innovations can benefit the supply chain, and how the supply chain members should respond with coordinated operational decisions. More specifically, we consider a platform supply chain where a supplier sells a single product on an online platform provided by a retailer, and then hires a 3PL firm for transportation services. The 3PL firm may choose to raise capital through equity financing from external financial institutions, which can be used to support technology innovations to reduce the transportation cost. The financing decision of the 3PL interacts with operational decisions of the platform supply chain via possible cost savings. We start with investigating the supply chain coordination by characterizing the optimal operational decisions of the three firms under any given equity financing strategy. Acting non-cooperatively, the 3PL firm and the online retailer first determine the freight charge and revenue sharing respectively, in light of which the supplier’s decision on the retail price. We then move to the 3PL firm internally and derive the optimal equity financing strategy. Our analytical results show that the supply chain efficiency is dependent on the cost allocation between the retailer and the other two firms, but independent of the cost allocation between those two firms. It is also revealed that the original shareholders of the 3PL firm always have a chance to benefit from an appropriate financing strategy, and the optimal financing strategy may depend discontinuously on supply chain parameters. Finally, we check the robustness of our model and show that all key findings remain unchanged when relaxing the deterministic cost reduction to an uncertain one.}

To understand adolescents’ experiences and attitudes toward yoga, with a particular focus on acceptability and feasibility of a yoga intervention for depressed adolescents.
Design
Qualitative analysis of data from three focus groups and eight individual interviews, for a total of 22 teen participants.
Setting
Outpatient setting in a psychiatric hospital in the U.S.
Main outcome measures
Teens were asked about their own and their peers’ attitudes toward, and experiences with, hatha yoga; reactions to a study-created yoga video; and opinions on class logistics.
Results
Teens had both positive and negative attitudes toward, and experiences with, hatha yoga. They commented on “who does yoga;” many responses suggested a limited group (e.g., moms; people with money and time). Participants agreed that yoga could be potentially beneficial for depressed or stressed teens. Self-consciousness while being in a yoga class was a major concern. Overall, teens reacted favorably to the study-created yoga video. Teens had varied opinions about class logistics including class duration and size. Teens cited barriers to class, such as transportation, as well as barriers to home yoga practice.
Conclusions
Key points for developing a yoga class that might be appealing to depressed or stressed teens include: creating a class with variety that teens will find interesting; taking concrete steps to decrease teen self-consciousness; incorporating messages relevant for teens and consistent with yoga philosophy; and actively countering stereotypes about who practices yoga. Limitations of this study include the lack of data from male teens.}

abstract = {The collaborative vehicle routing problem for logistic optimization is a fundamental part of the sustainable supply chain, and has increasingly been of concern in recent years. This study proposes a novel logistics collaboration model to address the collaborative vehicle routing problem that involves shared carriers and depots (CVRP-SCD). This is inspired by the fact that a depot often has orders for multiple carriers, and a carrier often delivers orders to multiple depots. This problem involves decreasing transportation distances and improving capacity utilization by extending supply-side unilateral logistics collaborations to simultaneously consider collaborations between supply- and demand-sides. Further, the proposed CVRP-SCD model uses a composite objective that is a weighted sum of four objectives — including quality, reliability, cost, and time — to accurately evaluate and analyze the efficiency improvement. An extended variable neighborhood search algorithm is presented based on three matrices, including the carrier collaboration matrix, depot collaboration matrix, and transportation sequence matrix. This algorithm aims to address the trade-offs among multiple objectives for the CVRP-SCD model by incorporating new operators based on specific features involved in the problem. Simulation experiments are performed on two sets of instances to evaluate the proposed algorithm’s effectiveness as well as the savings produced from the proposed model. Further, a comparison experiment between different objective optimization also verifies the rationality of the proposed composite multi-objective optimization.}

To establish this system, lipid metabolism is needed for the de novo synthesis of lipids and the recycling of extracellular lipids and erythrocyte lipid components. Cholesterol supply depends on its uptake from the extracellular environment and erythrocyte cytoplasm, but phospholipids can be synthesized on their own. This differential production of lipid species creates unique modifications in the lipid profile of parasitized erythrocytes, which in turn may influence the biophysical and/or mechanical properties of organelles and vesicles and communication among them. Variations in local membrane properties possibly influence the transportation of various molecules such as parasite-derived proteins, because efficiencies in secretion, vesicle fusion and budding are partly determined by the lipid profiles. Comprehensive understanding of the parasite's lipid metabolism and the biophysics of lipid membranes provides fundamental knowledge about these pathogenic organisms and could lead to new anti-malarials.}

Hypothermic static cold storage and machine perfusion strategies remain the clinical standard of care for liver graft preservation. Recently, the protection of the mitochondrial function and the energetic levels derived from it has emerged as one of the key points for organ preservation. However, the complex interactions between liver mitochondrial protection and its relation with the use of solutions/perfusates has been poorly investigated. The use of an alternative IGL-2 solution to Belzer MPS one for hypothermic oxygenated perfusion (HOPE), as well as in static cold storage, introduce a new kind of perfusate to be used for liver grafts subjected to HOPE strategies, either alone or in combination with hypothermic static preservation strategies. IGL-2 not only protected mitochondrial integrity, but also avoided the mixture of different solutions/perfusates reducing. Thus, the operational logistics and times prior to transplantation, a critical factor when suboptimal organs such as donation after circulatory death or steatotic ones, are used for transplantation. The future challenges in graft preservation will go through (1) the improvement of the mitochondrial status and its energetic status during the ischemia and (2) the development of strategies to reduce ischemic times at low temperatures, which should translate in a better transplantation outcome.}

Eighty-eight per cent used CAD-CAM design, with highly variable funding/access, design/manufacturing workflows (in-house/outsourced). Eighty-eight per cent were involved with trauma, 61% with orthognathic, and 52% with oncology-reconstruction surgery. Favourite applications for printed titanium were orbital floor repair (89%) and free-flap jaw reconstruction (87%). Most participants also cited maxillary/zygomatic osteotomies and cranioplasty (range 61%-73%). Although a popular application (78%), the evidence base in temporomandibular joint surgery is limited. Those performing orthognathic surgery perceived more indications than those who did not (p=0.013). Key barriers included cost, turnaround time and logistics, and the need to be trained in traditional techniques. Printed titanium was useful for both common and niche procedures, but was specifically limited in emergency trauma. Most surgeons had experience in CAD-CAM surgery but technical understanding appeared unclear. Limiting factors included variable funding and production pathways, perceived costs, and logistics, but in-house design can minimise them. In part II, we quantify perceived benefits and limitations and whether surgeons’ understanding and knowledge are sufficient to rationalise them.}

These trends provide new opportunities for the improvement of production materials, construction, processes, and capacities. Innovative technologies improve the processes of business analyses and forecasting, as well as new product development, order processing, logistics, production automation, quality control, and marketing. Modern technologies are gradually replacing ergonomically demanding and dangerous occupations. Such innovations are particularly necessary for the transformation of problem companies and regions, as they often have a significant impact on economic development. This study is part of our long-term research on the technology innovation of problem companies and regions. Its primary goal is to methodically emphasize the importance and role of technology innovation management, mainly in problem companies, and analytically compare the innovation success of regions and countries from a global perspective. The study was carried out from 2015 to 2021. The time scope of the analyzed data is 2000–2018. The results show a certain Asian dominance in technology innovation management, in terms of the number of technology patents as well as of the growth dynamics and the ability to overcome the pandemic and crises in general.}

abstract = {Background
Persistent medicine shortages have highlighted that global access to essential medicines remain problematic. Existing supply chain vulnerabilities impact health systems and risk consumer safety.
Objectives
This study aimed to examine how different key stakeholders’ roles facilitate access to essential medicines.
Methods
In depth interviews were conducted with 47 participants across seven stakeholder groups globally. Stakeholders included government, academics, consumer groups, non-profit organizations, hospital healthcare providers, manufacturers, and wholesaler/distributors. An inductive approach to data analysis was undertaken. A pragmatic Grounded Theory “approach” was adopted, using tools such as open, axial, and selective coding. Thematic content analysis was applied to the comprehensive theory of collaboration to provide a contextual management framework to interpret themes. Results were displayed in Ishikawa fishbone diagrams for decision making and the logistics process.
Results
Findings showed that logistics management and therapeutic decision making were managed separately by stakeholders. Interestingly, hospital pharmacists had overlapping roles in patient care decisions and supply chain logistics, highlighting their importance as supply chain managers. Furthermore, despite the significant role that wholesalers/distributors had in managing supply disruptions and shortages, they were not involved in the decision-making process and did not participate in therapeutic selection committees. Additionally, sometimes stakeholders’ intended control mechanisms contributed to increasing the complexity of the supply chain.
Conclusion
There is a need for improved and innovative stakeholder engagement. Expanding the role of pharmacy to include hospital formulary pharmacists and including wholesaler/distributors in therapeutic selection committee decisions could improve these collaborations, may help to align the selection and procurement of medicines processes.}

abstract = {The popularity of remanufacturing among the research community resulted in an increase in the number of academic publications in recent years. Quite a number of literature reviews related to reverse logistics, core acquisition management, Design for Remanufacturing (DfRem), production planning, analytical models in remanufacturing were published in various journals. The management of remanufactured products is quite complex due to specific operations like core acquisition, reverse logistics, disassembly, cleaning, repairing and reassembly. This often makes determining the price of remanufactured product a difficult task. Moreover, pricing of remanufactured products acts as a control mechanism to maintain the demand for both new and remanufactured products. A significant number of academic publications have been published regarding pricing and competition decision in remanufacturing. This paper aims to study with a focus on pricing related decisions in remanufacturing through bibliometric analysis that can provide insights into the latest research trends in this area by analysing the most significant and cited papers, authors collaboration network, keywords, countries, and institutions. In this paper, a thorough review and bibliometric analysis are conducted over 336 articles from 2000 until May 2020. The systematic mapping and analysis help to identify developing research areas, key research topics, publication evolution over time, collaboration patterns among authors, countries, the co-occurrence of authors keywords, and future research directions. From the content analysis, we have identified five pricing models such as pricing of remanufactured products under competition, impact of the product lifecycle on remanufacturing pricing, pricing related to product design in remanufacturing, pricing models under an uncertain environment, and optimal pricing under customer willingness-to-pay. We have also identified the decision variables, assumptions, and research objective(s) for each model. The findings of this research provide a direction for a further study in this domain, such as how pricing of a remanufactured products can be done in oligopolistic competition, how an effective product design strategy determines the price of remanufactured product, how the government regulatory policies influence the profitability in remanufacturing, or what is the effect of carbon cap and trade mechanism on the price of remanufactured products.}

abstract = {As the supply chain becomes more complicated and globalized, outsourcing techniques, such as the Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) under the Just-In-Time (JIT) conditions, are becoming widely adopted, in order to reduce inventory, lead-time and set up costs. For vendors, Third Party Logistics (TPL) is regarded as one of the best alternatives used to improve both their service level and profit. For TPL service providers, their profits must be maximized under economies of scale. However, under the JIT condition, it is very difficult to balance the order quantity whilst satisfying the predefined conditions related to inventory level. In addition, while transporting and keeping items, the exposition to various risk factors is likely. In this paper, we propose the TPL service provider to determine the optimal order quantity, considering defective items under the VMI and JIT conditions. By designing a mathematical decision-making problem based on the EPQ (Economic Production Quantity)/EOQ (Economic Order Quantity) with defective items, we can find the optimal order quantity for TPL service providers under VMI and JIT. With illustrative numerical examples, the procedure and the impacts of the expected defective rates are explained with sensitivity analysis.

A decision-making tool incorporating concepts of logistics and supply chain, considering different types of waste was developed. A multi-objective, multi-period mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation, focusing on the plastic recycling network, incorporating features of multimodal transportation was implemented. The model aims at minimizing net present cost (NPC) and environmental impacts, illustrated by a case study of a Swiss waste treatment cluster. A reference situation was used for benchmarking and 7 new scenarios considered - corresponding to different plastics collection configurations. From the solutions space, designs arise that lead to a 2-fold decrease of NPC at the expense of increasing by 20 % current emissions, as well as solutions that provide small net gains in environmental aspects - close to 3 %, albeit a 4-fold increase in NPC due to large investments in recycling facilities and increased transportation costs. This work sheds light on the impact of supply chain and logistics aspects on the separate collection and treatment of waste plastics, in the context of a real municipal waste treatment policy, where a thermodynamic model to deal with the conversion processes is integrated into the general supply chain decision. As a result, important insights to guide decision-makers were obtained.}

This paper includes a description of methods for changepoint detection applied to disaggregate vehicle speed and volume data to establish a transportation travel time reliability threshold. In the context of enterprise logistics and surface transportation, reliability is measured by the frequency of deviations from anticipated vehicle speeds associated with a given operating condition. In this paper, anticipated speeds are calculated as the speed values with the highest kernel density estimate (KDE) in lieu of traditional statistics of median or mean speed conditions. Specific complexities of transportation networks, such as stochastic system capacity, necessitates the identification of operational thresholds associated with rapid performance degradation. Results from a demonstration dataset (comprised of millions of observations) indicates a rapid decline in reliability near half of the capacity defined by traditional traffic models. Variability of the travel time reliability threshold was observed across geographic locations and years of observation, which conforms with concepts of stochastic system capacity based on inherent randomness of exogenous system factors.}

abstract = {Introduction
There is broad consensus that community pharmacists should focus on the provision of pharmaceutical care. Studies, however, have shown that community pharmacists still spend a considerable amount of time on traditional activities such as dispensing instead of cognitive pharmaceutical services (CPS). It is not clear whether community pharmacists prefer their current time-utilization or if they are willing to spend more time on CPS.
Aim
The aim of this study was to identify how community pharmacists ideally would prioritize CPS compared to other daily activities.
Methods
A cross-sectional study design with Q-methodology was used to identify different viewpoints regarding task prioritization. Community pharmacists were asked to rank a total of 48 daily activities. Data was collected online using FlashQ©. Q-sorts were analyzed by principal component factor analysis and varimax rotation using PQmethod 2.35.
Results
In total, 166 community pharmacists participated in this study. Three distinguishing groups were found based on task prioritization explaining 59% of the total variance among respondents. All groups ranked the provision of CPS as important, in differing degrees. Group 1 ranked CPS as most important and was also the group that contained most participants. Group 2 and 3 ranked quality assurance as most important with CPS as second. Logistics and pharmacy management were ranked low by all groups.
Discussion and conclusion
Community pharmacists rank the provision of CPS as important. So factors, probably other than task prioritization, are keeping the pharmacist from focusing on CPS in daily practice. In other studies, time constraints are mostly mentioned as major barrier. Activities such as logistics and pharmacy management are given less priority and should be delegated to supporting staff members as much as possible, to enable pharmacists to focus their available time on activities they deem important.}

While the impacts of airports on employment have been debated within the European and North American contexts, airport-related urban development in China has been less well studied. Such an analysis is also timely given rapid urban and airport development in Chinese cities. Focusing on fifty-nine major airports in mainland China, employment centers are identified using gridded enterprise registration information. Our analysis suggests that there are few airports with nearby employment centers. However, planned airport economic zones (AEZs) with stronger policy support, longer periods of development, and located in major cities are more likely to have employment clusters. Furthermore, employment centers that do exist near airports are more likely specialize in manufacturing, transportation and logistics, and wholesale and retail trade rather than in financial and business services.}

In Australia, the rapid advance of warehousing has facilitated the challenging demands of customers. In the literature, the challenges of increasing reliability, space utilisation, and reducing waste have been managed through improved warehousing processes and technology; however, the important role of employees through responsibility shift in enhancing warehousing performance has not yet been fully explored. This study therefore examines the relationship between the employment of Responsibility Shift (RS) and Warehousing Performance (WP) in Australia within the processes of Inbounding and Storage through the usage of a survey conducted with department supervisors and managers of warehousing companies which were members of the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport in Australia (CILTA) and Supply Chain and Logistics Association of Australia (SCLAA). It was found that RS positively causes a statistically significant influence on warehousing performance. This research contributes to enrich the literature on RS as it is perhaps the first study which examines the effects of RS on warehousing performance in Australia while also enables warehousing managers to explore ways to improve warehousing performance from the human resource management perspective. Although being significant both in terms of managerial and academic implications, the generalizability of this research is limited from a small sample size. Future research, therefore, needs to look into a wider population as well as further investigation into the effects of Responsibility Shift in the rapidly developing warehousing business environment elsewhere in the world.}

Additionally, whether to include such express delivery service or not is an important yet outstandingly unsolved problem for online retailers. In this regard, this paper uses a game-theoretic framework to investigate the channel structure, in which an offline retailer competes with an online retailer selling products to consumers through its partner express company. The consumers purchase from either an online or offline channel considering the delivery service as well as the inconvenience of shopping from physical stores. We consider three power structures: online retailer Stackelberg game, offline retailer Stackelberg game and Nash game. Under each power structure, we characterize the channel integration strategy for the online retailer. Interestingly, our results show that the online channel integration is not beneficial for the online retailer in most cases. Online retailers prefer to use express companies as intermediaries to avoid large logistics operations costs in the offline retailer Stackelberg game and Nash game. Only in the online retailer Stackelberg game, where the online retailer has the first-move advantage in the market, together with a moderate store-visiting inconvenience cost and a delivery service cost coefficient, will vertical integration improve the online channel’s profit. Dominant market power ensures sufficient profit to cover the logistics cost, and the moderate inconvenience cost and service cost coefficient promise a moderate logistics cost. Under this condition, the online retailer will choose the vertical integration strategy. We show in the extension that this strict condition can be relaxed when the online retailer owns a mixed channel. The online retailer with a mixed channel has more incentive to integrate than a pure online retailer does, as the mixed channel adds his power and helps to gain more market shares and profit. Our analysis generates managerial insights into the relationship between online retailers and express companies and provides a guide for implementing the vertical integration strategy in the online retailing industry.}

An economic benefit simulation considers operating room (OR) time savings and resulting costs regarding preoperative OR preparation, intraoperative OR handling and postoperative OR disposal, and sterilization costs.
Results
According to literature, re-sterilizable surgical instruments shows severe contamination after sterilization and reprocessed pedicle screws foreseen may demonstrate corrosion, contamination, deterioration and damage. In addition to the reprocessing costs, the re-sterilization of devices causes indirect expenses due to surgery delays, cancellations and infection treatments. Economic simulation shows average savings per case of 1.167€ for percutaneous and 983€ for open surgery, and of 21 min OR time for a terminally sterilized PSS. Considering also tray sterilization, the average cost savings amount 1.415€ per case.
Conclusions
To evaluate the benefits of disposable instruments compared to re-sterilizable systems, process-oriented comparative analyses are required. For the specific setting of spinal fusion surgery, single-use implants and instruments, streamlined instrumentation and optimized operative techniques have the potential to save costs due to significantly decreased expenses for processing, logistics, decreased rates of contaminated instruments, less OR delays, and potentially lower revision and SSI rates.}

abstract = {Improvement of logistics systems requires a specific objective function that may be subject to several constraints. However, for complex practical logistics systems, there is no way to grasp the system's behavior just in terms of a few equations. Simulation—especially time-sliced and discrete event simulation—can be used in such situations, as it allows for modeling the causality of systems on the basis of local logic. We illustrate the use of simulation to study practical logistics issues, such as transportation, inventory, and network structures. The analyses reported in this field mainly focus on economical improvements brought about by a reduction of traveled distance, truck load, cooling, etc. However, it turns out that in many cases these improvements also affect the other two dimensions of sustainability: The reduction of traveled distance directly leads to a decrease in energy use and pollution; and in urban areas such indicators will lead to less noise, reduced traffic jams, and as a consequence, better living conditions. This chapter discusses the simulation techniques (including the Monte Carlo technique), the introduction of environmental parameters into these models, and the combination of simulation with metaheuristics—called simheuristics—to integrate several optimization aspects. The field is illustrated with application examples involving the transportation of people, as well as the supply networks of industry and trade.}

Changes in protein were evidenced by relative casein, electropherograms and microstructure. Also, the melting time was longer for frozen acid casein to obtain the standard moisture content. The texture profile introduced increase in hardness with the increase in freezing time. Positive results were found for the b∗ colour parameter, tending the characteristic yellow colour of processed cheese. However, these changes were not observed in the chemical parameters of the processed cheese, indicating that frozen acid casein can be used to produce processed cheese with characteristics that meet industry standards.}

The objective of this paper is to find the appropriate location of the warehouse and determine the economical route using dynamic programming. The choice of economical routing would help in the conservation of fuel and emission of greenhouse gases as green routing is applied.

Microeconomic theory and choice theory have become the mainstream basis for state of the art empirical, disaggregate, econometric models.

abstract = {Jeddah is the most important port city in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The climate of Jeddah is mostly dry; however, events of intensive rainfall followed by urban flooding have been reported in recent history. These floods interrupt the logistics and lifelines of the city. In this study runoff analysis and Flash Flood management by the green roof low impact development (LID) control system, has been performed using United States environmental protection agency (EPA)’s Stormwater Management Model (SWMM). Six middle districts of the Jeddah city had been selected and modeled in five sub-catchment areas. The local soil and geographic conditions were incorporated into the model. The effect of the soil-based, rooftop, LID system has been emphasized in the analysis. In flood simulations, 30–70% of the impervious area of each sub-catchment, has been treated with LID. It has been observed that the LID application can significantly reduce the overall flood flow. Thus, simple but well-planned LID control systems can be effectively utilized, for the flood management of heavily urbanized regions.}

Moreover, sone algorithms such as the shortest path are omnipresent within our life. That is why nobody could ignore the importance of graph theory. Nowadays, the graph theory, as is, could not answer correctly to our new needs. In my point, for the current graph theory to answer much better to our new problem-solving requirements, the theory must include two more main pillars: the semantic factor and the superimposition factor.

abstract = {Home care services are an alternative answer to hospitalization, and play an important role in reducing the healthcare costs for governments and healthcare practitioners. To find a valid plan for these services, an optimization problem called the home healthcare routing and scheduling problem is motivated to perform the logistics of the home care services. Although most studies mainly focus on minimizing the total cost of logistics activities, no study, as far as we know, has treated the patients’ satisfaction as an objective function under uncertainty. To make this problem more practical, this study proposes a bi-objective optimization methodology to model a multi-period and multi-depot home healthcare routing and scheduling problem in a fuzzy environment. With regards to a group of uncertain parameters such as the time of travel and services as well as patients’ satisfaction, a fuzzy approach named as the Jimenez’s method, is also utilized. To address the proposed home healthcare problem, new and well-established metaheuristics are obtained. Although the social engineering optimizer (SEO) has been applied to several optimization problems, it has not yet been applied in the healthcare routing and scheduling area. Another innovation is to develop a new modified multi-objective version of SEO by using an adaptive memory strategy, so-called AMSEO. Finally, a comprehensive discussion is provided by comparing the algorithms based on multi-objective metrics and sensitivity analyses. The practicality and efficiency of the AMSEO in this context lends weight to the development and application of the approach more broadly.}

abstract = {There is a need for data on commercial-scale harvesting operations in hybrid poplar short rotation crops to better understand costs and logistics, especially for modeling large scale biorefineries. An investigation was conducted on the in-field performance of a single-pass cut-and-chip harvester operating in commercial fields for over 370 individual wagon loads representing a range of crop and field conditions. Mean material capacity peaked at 70 Mg h−1 in dry conditions in lower biomass (<60 Mg ha−1), but was only 28 Mg h−1 during wet conditions and often higher standing biomass. Wet ground conditions require the harvester to divert additional power to maintaining forward movement, which results in decreased material capacity and increased fuel consumption. Crops with higher standing biomass had taller trees that do not always feed as smoothly into the harvester, slowing forward progress and lowering material capacity. Mean crop specific fuel consumption, L of fuel per Mg of biomass processed, generally decreased as standing biomass increased. When standing biomass was above 40 Mg ha−1 mean crop specific fuel consumption (FCC) was 1.69 L Mg−1 in dry conditions and 3.98 L Mg−1 in wet conditions, but when standing biomass was below 40 Mg ha−1 FCC increased drastically (as high as 5 L Mg−1) because the harvester is putting more effort into forward speed instead of material processing. Developing relationships between material capacity and fuel consumption based on standing biomass and ground conditions at representative scales are essential for conducting environmental and economic analyses of these systems.}

abstract = {The willingness to invest in Internet of Things (IoT) and Big Data Analytics (BDA) seems not to depend on supply nor demand of technological innovations. The required sensing and communication technologies have already matured and became affordable for most organizations. Businesses on the other hand require more operational data to address the dynamic and stochastic nature of supply chains. So why should we wait for the actual implementation of tracking and monitoring devices within the supply chain itself? This paper provides an objective overview of state-of-the-art IoT developments in today’s supply chain and logistics research. The main aim is to find examples of academic literature that explain how organizations can incorporate real-time data of physically operating objects into their decision making. A systematic literature review is conducted to gain insight into the IoT’s analytical capabilities, resulting into a list of 79 cross-disciplinary publications. Most researchers integrate the newly developed measuring devices with more traditional ICT infrastructures to either visualize the current way of operating, or to better predict the system’s future state. The resulting health/condition monitoring systems seem to benefit production environments in terms of dependability and quality, while logistics operations are becoming more flexible and faster due to the stronger emphasis on prescriptive analytics (e.g., association and clustering). Further research should extend the IoT’s perception layer with more context-aware devices to promote autonomous decision making, invest in wireless communication networks to stimulate distributed data processing, bridge the gap in between predictive and prescriptive analytics by enriching the spectrum of pattern recognition models used, and validate the benefits of the monitoring systems developed.}
