abstract = {Reinforcement learning (RL) is an emerging research topic in production and logistics, as it offers potentials to solve complex planning and control problems in real time. In recent years, many researchers investigated RL algorithms for solving production scheduling problems. However, most of the related articles reveal only little information about the process of developing and implementing RL applications. Against this background, we present a method for modeling production scheduling problems as RL environments. More specifically, we propose the application of Discrete-Event Simulation for modeling production scheduling problems as an interoperable environments and the Gym interface of the OpenAI foundation to allow a simple integration of pre-built RL algorithms from OpenAI Baselines and Stable Baselines. We support our explanations with a simple example of a job shop scheduling problem.}

There has been steady progress on synthesizing FSCs in deterministic environments, but the algorithmic machinery needed for lifting such techniques to stochastic environments is not yet fully understood. While the derivation of FSCs has received some attention in the context of discounted expected reward measures, they are often solved approximately and/or without correctness guarantees. In essence, that makes it difficult to analyze fundamental concerns such as: do all paths terminate, and do the majority of paths reach a goal state? In this paper, we present new theoretical results on a generic technique for synthesizing FSCs in stochastic environments, allowing for highly granular specifications on termination and goal satisfaction.}

abstract = {Objective
To explore fathers' pregnancy and early infancy experiences in supporting his infant, partner, and himself, using information collected from fathers, mothers, and mother-father dyads in a low-income, urban community.
Background
Father involvement is associated with positive child health outcomes and parental well-being. However, little information exists about low-income parents' perceived needs for father involvement during pregnancy and infancy.
Methods
This was an exploratory qualitative study of parents in low-income communities of Baltimore, Maryland. Participants were conveniently sampled via partnerships with community organizations. Eighty percent of parents were African American. Four focus groups were conducted with fathers (n = 8), 4 with mothers (n = 9), and 4 interviews with father-mother dyads (n = 8). Sessions were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using iterative, inductive open coding performed independently by two team members (interrater agreement 86%). Frequency tables were generated for identified categories for content analysis and theme development.
Results
Five themes were identified: perspectives on the father role, supporting partners, negotiating co-parenting, parenting logistics, and learning parenting skills. Participants expressed the importance of fathers to “be there” and barriers to being involved (e.g., finances, lack of role models). Fathers discussed needing to learn how to manage partner conflicts, while mothers discussed fathers' need for greater empathy. Dyads discussed the importance of co-parenting strategies (e.g., effective communication, sharing responsibilities). Logistics included direct infant care, finances, and community resources. Fathers discussed learning by trial and error rather than informational resources and relying on healthcare professionals for pregnancy information and female relatives for infant care.
Conclusion
Participants discussed various needs of fathers to be effective partners and parents, and lacking informational resources tailored specifically for fathers. Research is needed to explore the best ways to tailor and disseminate information to fathers, especially prenatally.
Implications
Study findings have significant implications for improving the ways in which maternity care, community-based programs, and pediatric providers support father involvement.}

Upon failure, a substitute good rented from a third party is installed. A logistics service provider picks up the failed good and delivers it to the repair shop. On arrival at the repair shop the failed good is repaired, returned, and installed for use. Rent for the substitute ends at installation of the repaired good. Idle repair shop capacity can be used for other revenue generating tasks, depending on the time the capacity is available. We consider three failed good collection modes. First, a failed good is immediately collected, transported, and immediately admitted to the repair shop. Second, the logistics service provider is allowed a certain slack time for the delivery of the failed good to the repair shop. Third, a failed good is only admitted periodically to the shop and collection and transportation ensures that the failed good is available in the repair shop at the start of the first period possible. We ask under what conditions a transportation slack time, either as a constant slack or as a periodic admission to the repair shop, can be beneficial. We present analytical solutions for immediate transportation and transportation with a constant time slack considering costs. We find that (some) transportation time slack can be beneficial for high failure rates and high transportation costs.}

We developed a peer-led group program for Veterans called Taking Charge of My Life and Health (TCMLH) that emphasizes patient education, goal setting, shared decision making, and whole person care. Our aim was to conduct an evaluation of a facilitator training course to deliver TCMLH in VA sites.
Methods
Repeated measures ANOVA models were used to examine change over three timepoints (pre-test, post-test, and two-month follow-up) in outcomes of attitudes, knowledge, skills, and self-efficacy related to patient empowerment, skills acquisition, self-care strategies, and curriculum facilitation. Qualitative data analysis of participant feedback was used to identify potential training adaptations and barriers to TCMLH delivery.
Results
Our sample comprised 70 trainees who completed all three assessments. Participants reported high levels of training satisfaction, quality, and utility, and sustained improvements in knowledge of Whole Health, self-efficacy for group facilitation, and self-efficacy for using Whole Health concepts and tools. Implementation barriers included challenges related to group management and site logistics.
Conclusion
The facilitator training course improved knowledge and self-efficacy associated with successful peer-led program delivery and identified opportunities to improve the training course and TCMLH dissemination. Practice Implications: Findings provide insights on the design and implementation of training models to support peer-led programs.}

We consider a fleet that consists of high-capacity vehicles. The vehicles are used to transport steel slabs within the steel plant, i.e., between facilities and distinct areas of the slab yard, and they can carry out stacking operations autonomously. The slab yard stores a majority of all steel slabs. It is organized in rows that function as a two-dimensional stacking area. Each row consists of multiple stacks built up by steel slabs that are located on top of each other. Retrieving steel slabs from stacks amounts to solving an extended block relocation problem (BRP). We study a combined approach for solving both the routing of steels slabs within the plant and the stacking of steel slabs in storage as part of their retrieval during a vehicle’s pickup operation.}

It adds capacity restrictions to the mobile facility location problem introduced previously by Demaine et al. (2009), thereby extending the problem to a practical setting. In the problem, one seeks to relocate (or move) a set of existing facilities and assign clients to these facilities while respecting capacities so that the weighted sum of facility movement costs and the client travel costs (each to its assigned facility) is minimized. We provide two integer programming formulations for the CMFLP. The first is on a layered graph, while the second is a set partitioning formulation. We prove that the linear relaxation of the set partitioning formulation provides a tighter lower bound to the CMFLP than the linear relaxation of the layered graph formulation. We then develop a branch-and-price algorithm on the set partitioning formulation. We find that the branch-and-price procedure is particularly effective both in terms of solution quality and running time, when the ratio of the number of clients to the number of facilities is small and the facility capacities are tight. Finally, we present two heuristic approaches for the CMFLP. One is a linear programming rounding heuristic, and the other is based on a natural decomposition of the problem on the layered graph.}

Sales and supply chain structures in build-to-order industries generally have cross-functional and conflicting objects that are not easily comparable. The current research is an extension of an innovative S&OP model within a more dynamically complex system in terms of demands uncertainty and unreliability of backup supplies. The promoted model is utilized for more efficient management and integration of industrial restrictions and sales essentials in global supply chain networks in terms of demand and supply coordination and responsiveness toward customers’ needs. Accordingly, this research has applied a simulation-based optimization approach to balance the trade-off between logistics cost and customers’ experience level as the main objectives. Two classes of strategies are offered for handling parts’ replenishment and flexibility to the sales structure. Initially, the proposed model evaluates two main inventory strategies’ performances. Thereafter, the optimized values of flexibility degree and safety stock fraction for corresponding inventory strategies are calculated by using a multi-objective simulation-optimization method. The investigation begins with an overall assessment of the system's performance. Furthermore, it details the alterations among the strategies’ key performance indicators (KPIs) as system parameters’ function.}

Previous studies about comorbidity have primarily focused on disorders based on diagnostic criteria instead of symptoms. This study aimed to describe the prevalence and risk factors of anxiety comorbid depression based on a population-based sample in Chifeng City Inner Mongolia and explored the gender differences of depressive subtypes in anxiety patients.
Methods
This study was a cross-sectional study conducted among 6376 community residents. Logistics analysis and multiple-group latent class analysis was used in exploring the risk factors and subtypes of anxiety comorbid depressive symptoms.
Results
A total of 4528 respondents were interviewed in this study. The lifetime prevalence estimates for anxiety in the total sample was 5.70%. Among residents who had ever had anxiety, most of them reported having depressive symptoms while 15.79% of them met the criteria of MDD. Logistics analysis showed childhood adversities were associated with anxiety comorbid depressive symptoms. The results of multiple-group latent class analysis showed that the latent class probabilities were different between males and females.
Conclusion
The prevalence rates of comorbidity were similar to the reports of previous regional surveys in China with statistically significant differences of comorbidity occurring between males and females. Precision prevention should therefore be targeted towards different kinds of populations.}

The first tier refers to the transportation between the city distribution centers, in the outskirts of the city, and intermediate facilities, while the second tier refers to the transportation of goods between the intermediate facilities and the (pickup and delivery) customers. We focus on the second tier, and consider that customers and facilities have time windows in which they can be visited. Waiting is possible at waiting stations for free or at customers and facilities at a given cost or penalty. Therefore, it is relevant to coordinate the arrivals of vehicles at facilities and customers with the corresponding time windows. The MT-PDTWCF calls for determining minimum (fixed, routing and waiting) cost multi-trip routes, for a given fleet of vehicles, to service separately pickup and delivery customers, while taking into account vehicle capacity and time windows both at customers and facilities. We propose the first exact algorithm for MT-PDTWCF, namely a Branch-and-Cut-and-Price algorithm. It is based on column generation, where the pricing problem is solved by a bi-directional dynamic programming algorithm designed to cope with the features of the problem. Subset-row and rounded capacity inequalities are adapted to deal with MT-PDTWCF and inserted in the Branch-and-Cut-and-Price algorithm. The performance of the proposed algorithm is tested on benchmark instances with up to 200 customers, showing its effectiveness.}

Specifically, three dimensions of perceived value including symbolic, functional, and economic values are conceptualized as the antecedents of brand attachment. Using an online survey sample of 462 bikesharing users in Taiwan, our findings indicate that both symbolic and economic values instead of functional value have significant positive effects on brand attachment. We found that psychological ownership mediates between brand attachment and brand citizenship behavior. User's brand attachment leads to positive influence on both psychological ownership and brand citizenship behavior. Psychology ownership also has a positive effect on brand citizenship behavior.}

Pharmacy educational standards provide requirements for interprofessional education (IPE). However, there has not been a comparison of IPE structure between doctor of pharmacy programs in the United States (US). The purpose of this study was to gather information regarding current IPE programs and curricula in schools/colleges of pharmacy (S/COP) across the US.
Methods
A survey was developed and emailed to at least one faculty member or administrator from each S/COP responsible for IPE or experiential education. The survey gathered information on IPE status, structure, and oversight. It also explored mechanisms promoting IPE success, pieces of advice for starting or expanding IPE, and hurdles for IPE implementation.
Results
Eighty-five S/COP representing 59.9% of programs in the US responded to the survey. All respondents felt IPE was either very important or important to pharmacy education. Mechanisms that promoted IPE success included partnerships, faculty interest in IPE, having an IPE center, being located on an academic medical center, administrative support, and integrating IPE during curricular development. IPE hurdles included logistics, faculty buy-in, sustainability, distance from other programs, and differing accreditation standards across programs. Themes of advice for others were to be innovative/patient/flexible, collaborative, identify key initial partners, develop a director or coordinator of IPE position, and receive administrative support.
Conclusions
IPE is a vital component to training the next generation of health professionals, but the process for can be daunting. Building on the successes of others and predicting barriers can assist S/COP in developing effective IPE.}

This problem arises under a two-echelon vendor-managed inventory system when a company must make vehicle routing and inventory management decisions, while renting a fleet subject to short- and mid-term agreements. Different chemical products are transported contaminating the vehicles that may require cleaning activities. Pickups of input take place in the first echelon, and the final product deliveries are performed in the second echelon. Based on a real-life case in the petrochemical industry, we introduce a formulation that takes into account vehicle rentals, cleanings, transportation, inventory management, and vehicle returns decisions. We design a branch-and-cut algorithm to solve it and also propose a matheuristic, in which vehicle routes are handled by an adaptive large neighborhood mechanism, while input pickups, product deliveries, and fleet planning are performed by solving several subproblems to optimality. Moreover, we introduce a hybrid parallel framework, combining our matheuristic and the branch-and-cut algorithm in order to solve very large instances exactly. We validate our methods by solving a set of instances of the two-echelon multi-depot inventory-routing problem from the literature, obtaining new best solutions for all instances. We have introduced a set of instances for this rich and new problem, and performed an extensive assessment of our methods. The results provide interesting data about the supply chain structure.}

Although for these facilities helicopters have been considered as the most appropriate transportation vehicles due to their speed, reliability and accessibility, they also involve risks which can lead to fatalities. Within this context, the present work is focused on the development of a helicopter routing model that integrates non-deterministic failure rate as function of the helicopter’s cumulative traveled distance/time. Due to the complexity of the transportation task we also developed a Bayesian approach to generate instances for accurate testing and an evolutionary meta-heuristic to provide suitable solutions for large instances. As findings, the proposed routing model determined that reliable transportation decreases as failure rate increases. As consequences, the time-to-failure and the length of reliable flights decrease. This can lead to require more routes and helicopters to serve a set of facilities. The advances of the present work can be extended to other industries and logistic fields where reliable route planning is required in the presence of failure risks associated to the vehicles used for transportation (i.e., maritime and port logistics, risk and security management, transportation systems design and strategic sourcing and procurement).}

Refrigeration is also key to enable successful transcontinental export to distant markets. To minimize the environmental impact of the cold chain and to optimize logistics, a better knowledge of the fruit quality evolution within individual shipments would be extremely valueable. For this purpose, a digital fruit twin is developed, based on mechanistic modeling. This digital twin simulates the thermal behavior of mango fruit throughout the cold chain, based on the measured environmental temperature conditions, namely the air temperature in the vicinity of the fruit. At the same time, the evolution of associated quality attributes, due to enzymatically-driven, temperature-dependent biochemical degradation reactions, is quantified. Also, a biophysical counterpart of real mango fruit – an innovative fruit simulator sensing device – was developed and used for model validation of fruit pulp temperatures. We identified – in-silico – the impact of the unique delivery air temperature history and cold chain length on fruit quality evolution for actual maritime vs. airfreight transport pathways. Digital twins were found to provide complementary insights in the thermophysical behavior of fruit, particularly in supply chains of very perishable species, and for storage at low airflow rates. Such mechanistic modeling enabled to understand, record, and predict where temperature-dependent fruit quality loss occurs in each supply chain. In that way, digital twins can help to improve refrigeration processes and logistics to reduce food losses, thereby making the refrigerated supply chain greener.}

abstract = {This paper addresses the vehicle routing problem with consideration of vehicle capacities, time windows, multiple products, fleet sizes, and fleet size limits on roads (VRPTWFS). The mathematical model is developed to find an optimal schedule with minimum transportation costs. Since the problem is NP-hard, metaheuristics are required to find a near-optimal solution for larger, more practical problems. Therefore, this paper presents the hybridization of PSO and ALNS, which is firstly developed, for solving the problem. To help the route planner to decide the best routes and schedules for ice transport, a software tool (IceApp) based on the hybridization of PSO and ALNS is designed and developed. The IceApp has an architecture made of software components, running on the cloud server, where the Web Application, Web Service and Database Management System are installed. To support the transportation decision-makers, by taking advantage of the available demand data input to the IceApp software, a mobile application for a vehicle driver has been introduced for application in the ice manufacturing industry. Knowing exact demand allows logistics staff and route planners to coordinate their logistics and distribution with the right number of vehicles, optimize routes and maintain appropriate inventory by improving the availability of real-time customer information, resulting in lower transportation and holding costs. The mobile application for ice transportation also provides more user-friendly visualization, displaying route maps and route flow obtained from the calculation.}

abstract = {Stochastic dynamic vehicle routing problems have become an essential part of logistics and mobility services. In such problems, a sequence of vehicle routing decisions has to be made in reaction and anticipation of newly revealed stochastic information. To this end, a variety of computational operations research methods has emerged in the literature, increasingly integrating potential future information in their decision making. The integration of information models into decision models via computational methods is known as prescriptive analytics, the most recent advance of business analytics. In this paper, we explore the existing work and future potential of prescriptive analytics for stochastic dynamic vehicle routing. We identify the characteristics of decision models and information models unique in stochastic dynamic vehicle routing and analyze how different methodology meets the characteristics' requirements. We use the insights to derive recommendations about promising methodology when approaching specific stochastic dynamic vehicle routing problems.}

As our ability to manage complex medical conditions improves, so too does our understanding of the benefits of good enteral nutrition on health outcomes for these children. If oral feeding is not possible, an enteral tube can provide a viable alternative by delivering nutrition directly into the stomach or jejunum. The decision to recommend a child for long term tube feeding is complex and needs to be balanced against the potential risks. It is therefore essential that healthcare professionals keep up to date with the indications for referral, understand the current options available to children, and are able to identify common and serious problems that can arise following tube insertion. Healthcare professionals should also be aware of the debate surrounding the administration of blended feeds via the enteral tube. While some children may benefit from this practice, there are important considerations to be made for children receiving home blended feeds versus enteral formula. In this article, we review the indications for enteral tube insertion, device selection, complications and subsequent management. In addition, we review the logistics and implications for families and healthcare teams aiming to start blended tube feeding.}

The Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted organised sport in the community as authorities cancelled, greatly modified or postponed sporting participation as part of a strategy to reduce transmission of the virus. This had a significant impact on young athletes and their families in relation to their psycho-social, physical and career progression considerations. The disruption is likely to continue for some years, considering the constraints of lockdowns, the need to overcome dysfunctional national logistics for delivery of medical care, fund and implement an efficacious vaccine programme locally, nationally and worldwide, develop sufficient herd immunity and create an environment of confidence in the safety of returning to sports for participants, coaches, umpires, administrators and observers. This article will consider the interim challenges regarding the physical and psychosocial importance of maintaining an active sporting programme for young athletes, reflect on safety measures for modifying sporting equipment and environmental protections to allow safest participation in training and competition and provide advice on protocols for a gradual return to sport for the young athlete after infection with Covid-19.}

With the development of technology, competition has gradually shifted from commodity-based attributes, such as cost and quality, to a supply chain's service capacity for e-commerce. Within this context, the present paper delineates how cross-border e-commerce firms can generate supply chain service capabilities that yield improvements in supply chain relationship quality to e-tailors and other platform users. Insights are derived through data collected via a multiple case study approach based on four Chinese cross-border e-commerce enterprises (OSell, Zongteng, BizArk and Linca); data were collected from 41 semi-structured interviews, field visits and secondary data. Relying on the service-dominant logic as the theoretical foundation, we identify three supply chain resources (flows related to information, logistics and finance) and their interplay as being critical for the development of supply chain service capabilities, which in turn lead to an improvement in the quality of supply chain relationships (assessed by the dimensions of trust improvement/commitment, risk mitigation, and customer satisfaction). The results offer important insights into how to best manage supply chain resources in relation to the three flows by cross-border e-commerce firms in order to foster relationship quality, an attribute that has become so critical today for competitive differentiation.}

abstract = {Diesel-fired combustion is one of the main sources of air pollution in the world. In this study, to better understand the energy consumption and main air pollutant emissions of diesel-fired combustion, a practical investigation and historical data analyses were conducted to determine the variations and driving forces of diesel consumption, the distribution of diesel consumption, and the contribution of emissions among various industries. Based on the results of this study, future control measures can be proposed for diesel-fired combustion. The results show that economic development led to an increase in the total volume of passengers and freight transportation, and the number of diesel vehicles increased from 0.16 million in 2009 to 0.25 million in 2018. However, diesel consumption in Beijing decreased from 2.4 Mt in 2009 to 1.8 Mt in 2018 due to the dominant driving forces, such as structural optimization of the diesel vehicle fleet and stricter limit standards for single-vehicle fuel consumption. The use of diesel vehicles in the logistics and transportation industries and the use of diesel-fired machinery in the construction industry were the two main sources of diesel consumption, accounting for 55% and 23% of the total, respectively. The main air pollutant emissions from diesel-fired combustion from 2009 to 2018 first increased and then decreased, while the NOX emissions peaked at 74,800 tons in 2014, which was affected by the structural optimization of the vehicle fleet and the elimination of old diesel trucks. The emissions finally decreased to 54,000 tons in 2018, which was approximately 89% of the amount in 2009. However, the continuously increasing contribution of diesel combustion to the total emissions requires more attention. The electrification of diesel vehicles and the structural upgrading of diesel vehicles have played important roles in mitigating the emissions of diesel combustion. Our study suggests that consumption control targets should be set, reduction plans for key industries such as the logistics and transportation, construction, and tourism industries should be developed, and low-emission zones should be created to promote the elimination and updating of low-emission diesel vehicles and machinery.}

abstract = {Background
Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is well established as a clinically successful and cost-effective procedure. The transition of the US healthcare system from a fee-for-service model to a value-based care model requires careful examination of patient care to ensure both quality and efficiency. Sterile-packed, single-use instruments have been introduced as a tool to help streamline the operating room (OR) logistics while reducing sterilization requirements. The aim of this study was to examine the potential logistic and economic benefits of single-use instruments compared to traditional, reusable instruments for TKA.
Methods
Four variables related to TKA costs and logistics were modeled in this study: OR turnover time tray sterilization, tray management time, and 90-day infection rates. Model input data for traditional instruments and single-use instruments were based on peer-reviewed literature. A total of 200 sites and 500 cases per site were simulated using the Monte-Carlo-Technique.
Results
The median total cost savings with single-use instruments was $994 per case. The largest driver for cost savings was tray sterilization. Sites with higher staff wages and sterilization costs had a larger probability of realizing greater cost savings with adoption of single-use instruments. In cases using single-use instruments, up to 51% of operating days could have accommodated an additional procedure due to the time savings in OR turnover.
Conclusion
This cost modeling study observed significant potential for logistical and economic improvements in TKA with single-use vs reusable instruments. Although few studies have been conducted to measure the impact of single-use instruments in practice, the results of these simulations motivate further investigation.}

This chapter highlights the fact that businesses with transparent inventory and demand information could realize cost reductions and improve service levels using sensible business analytics. However, creating a platform to share the information and developing trustworthy partnerships are paramount. Our study discusses a few examples from current businesses to bring out the importance of collaboration by (1) sharing information with all supply chains partners and (2) moving from traditional ordering to an automated system with the support of business analytics and supply chain collaboration.}

Driven by advances in microcontroller, sensor and networking technologies, all entities, such as machines, products, load carriers, within a smart factory could become intelligent and able to assess their own situation and to attain their own goals successfully. However, local decision may exacerbate achieving global logistics performance due to the entities intrinsic selfishness. In this paper, we explore the trade-off between local decision-making and global performance management and derive first guidelines for the situation-specific design of a distributed control authority for smart factories.}

Gaps in the literature that need to be addressed through scientific research were also identified. More specifically, the following four aspects were covered: (1) the most prevalent AI techniques in SCM; (2) the potential AI techniques for employment in SCM; (3) the current AI-improved SCM subfields; and (4) the subfields that have high potential to be enhanced by AI. A specific set of inclusion and exclusion criteria are used to identify and examine papers from four SCM fields: logistics, marketing, supply chain and production.

abstract = {Hypoxia frequently occurs in postharvest logistics, which greatly influences fruit storability. Here, we for the first time studied the dynamic variations of mitochondrial morphology in living citrus fruit cells, and revealed that waxing treatment-induced hypoxia strongly triggered mitochondrial fission and fragmentation. Correspondingly, hypoxia caused a decline in mitochondrial membrane potential and mobility. Besides, impairment of energetic and redox status was also found in waxed fruit. The proteomic changes of mitochondria after waxing treatment were also characterized. Using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), we identified 167 key hypoxia-responsive proteins, which were mainly involved in fatty acid, amino acid and organic acid metabolism. Metabolite analysis verified that waxing treatment promoted the accumulation of several hypoxic metabolites, such as ethanol, acetaldehyde, succinic acid and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Taken together, our findings provide new insights into the cytological and proteomic responses of mitochondria to hypoxia during fruit storage.}

Existing research tends to highlight political patronage logics of distribution, and scholarship focuses primarily on politicians’ motivations. But service decisions are often made by bureaucrats, who sometimes explicitly try to avoid capture and allocate on the basis of need. Using qualitative interviews and spatial regressions with geo-coded data from a solar panel program in Ghana, we examine such a situation. We show that, despite considerable efforts to thwart it, national-level civil servants were unable to fully resist political capture. While solar panel distribution partially corresponded to need for electricity, we find that panels also went to areas where voter turnout was historically inconsistent, likely to motivate voter turnout. The direction of these relationships was consistent across subnational space, but the magnitudes varied considerably and were strongest in districts adjacent to Lake Volta. Qualitative data analysis reveals that this subnational variation reflects the logistics of space and the historical politics of place. The article contributes to theories of distributive politics and of voting behavior, and highlights the need for subnational disaggregation across space.}

Here, a summary of the already published results in these areas, which were divided into the four focused topics, is given: Collection and Logistics, Machines and waste treatment plants, Business models and Data Tools. Presented are systems and methods already used in waste management, as well as technologies that have already been successfully applied in other industrial sectors and will also be relevant in the waste management sector for the future. The focus is set on systems that could be used in waste treatment plants or machines in the future in order to make treatment of waste more efficient. In particular, systems which carry out the sorting of (mixed) waste via robotic technologies are of interest. Furthermore “smart bins” with sensors for material detection or level measurement, methods for digital image analysis and new business models have already been developed. The technologies are often based on large amounts of data that can contribute to increase the efficiency within plants. In addition, the results of an online market survey of companies from the waste management industry on the subject of waste management 4.0 or “digital readiness” are summarized.}

One way to reduce such externalities is the (re-)design of the overall network on which logistics activities take place, giving rise to green network design problems, where the minimization of emissions is an integral and explicit part of the objective. The aim of this chapter is to present an overview and a classification of green network design problems arising at different levels of decision making, from operational to strategic, and will present definitions, optimization models, and practical applications for some of the key problems in this category.}

In recent years, substantial attention has been paid to using biomass for producing bioenergy in order to increase economic performance, reduce environmental effects, and providing new opportunities in different societies in pursuit of sustainable development. The complexities related to procurement, logistics, technology selection, raw material management (biomass), and product distribution planning are the main causes of using the optimization models to design the bioenergy supply chains. On the other hand, the globalization of economy and industry increased the significance of the subjects related to global logistics and the ecological and social objectives of the countries have undeniable influences on each other. Hence, in this paper, a mathematical model has been developed to redesign a global bioenergy supply network. This model has simultaneously studied the economic, environmental, and social objectives and the environmental coefficients of the model were calculated using SimaPro software. The multi-objective model was solved by augmented ɛ-constraint method and the decision makers were informed of the obtained Pareto solutions. Data taken from the study on Iran and Armenia was used to validate the model and the Geographic information system (GIS) software was used with the goal of studying the geographical map of each country more accurately.}

Due to the heterogeneity of firms and issues of confidentiality and reliability of data, relatively little research has been done on modeling freight mode choice. To elicit estimates of a freight shipper's modal preference, data are needed on an individual's or firm's choice response and operational characteristics about the decision-maker themselves. Over the past few decades, two traditional preference-based approaches, revealed preference and stated preference, have provided many valuations, which have been able to be used in behavior analysis.

abstract = {Background
College student mental health (MH) problems and suicide risk have steadily increased over the past decade and a significant number of students with MH problems do not seek treatment. While some barriers to mental health care service utilization (MHSU) have been identified, very little is known regarding how these barriers differ among sociodemographic subgroups of students.
Method
Participants were 3,358 college students from four US universities who screened positive for elevated suicide risk (defined as 2 or more of: depression, alcohol misuse, suicidal ideation, suicide attempt) and were not actively receiving MH services. Reported barriers to MHSU were categorized into: Low perceived need, privacy/stigma concerns, questioning helpfulness of treatment, logistics, time constraints, finances, and cultural issues.
Results
Adjusted odds ratios indicated that finances were a greater barrier for women, sexual and gender minority students, and Black and Hispanic students. Privacy/stigma concerns were more prominent for men and young undergraduate students. White students and older undergraduate and graduate students were more likely to report a lack of time, and cultural sensitivity issues were significant barriers for sexual and gender minority, and racial/ethnic minority, students.
Limitations
Participating sites were not nationally representative. The barriers assessment did not examine the degree to which a specific barrier contributed to lack of MHSU relative to others.
Conclusions
In light of the significant variation in barriers based on age, gender identity, race/ethnicity, and sexual orientation, efforts to increase MHSU should be tailored to meet the unique needs of specific sociodemographic student subgroups.}

As expected, green product design and packaging practices (emphasize innovation) create environmental and cost benefits when there are high levels of internal and external collaboration. Instead, green production, sourcing, and logistics practices (emphasize operations) create performance when the levels of internal and external collaboration are low. Only green production creates financial/market performance at a high level of stakeholder collaboration.

We examined these outcomes in a large-cohort, single-center series of clinical EVLP cases.
Methods
All EVLP procedures performed at our institution between October 2008 and December 2017 were examined. The EVLPs were divided into 4 groups based on the indication for the procedure: group 1, high-risk brain death donors (HR-BDD); group 2, standard-risk donation after cardiac death (S-DCD); group 3, high-risk donation after cardiac death (HR-DCD); and group 4, logistics (LOGISTICS, the need for prolongation of preservation time or organ retrieval by a different transplantation team).
Results
During the study period, a total of 1106 lung transplants were performed in our institution. In this period, 372 EVLPs were performed, 255 (69%) of which were accepted for transplantation, resulting in 262 transplants. Utilization rates were 70% (140 of 198) for group 1, 82% (40 of 49) for group 2, 63% (69 of 109) for group 3, and 81% (13 of 16) for group 4 (P = .42, Fisher's exact test). Recipient age (P = .27) and medical diagnosis (P = .31) were not different across the 4 groups. Kaplan–Meier survival by EVLP indication group demonstrated no differences. Thirty-day mortality was 2.1% in group 1, 5% in group 2, 2.9% in group 3, and 0% in group 4 (P = .87, Fisher's exact test). The median days of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit stay, and hospital stay were 2, 4, and 21 in group 1; 2, 3, and 21 in group 2; 3, 5, and 28 in group 3; and 2, 4, and 17 in group 4 (P = .29, .17, and .09, respectively, Kruskal–Wallis rank-sum test).
Conclusions
Clinical implementation of EVLP has allowed our program to expand the annual lung transplantation activity by 70% in this time period. It has improved confidence in the utilization of DCD lungs and BDD lungs, with an average 70% utilization of post-EVLP treated donor lungs with excellent outcomes, while addressing significant challenges in donor lung assessment and the logistics of “real-life” clinical lung transplantation.}

To break the transmission chain of SARS-CoV-2, public health safety measures such as social distancing, regular hand hygiene, border closure, restrictions on internal movement, and lockdown were implemented. Some of these measures have however contributed to reduced economic power, shortage of labor for agricultural production, and huge losses in the agricultural sector. To avert the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on food losses in the agricultural value chain in Nigeria, much precedence should be placed on adequate stakeholder engagement. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, logistics for unhindered agricultural trade should be put in place. In addition, policy makers should implement the institutionalization and implementation of social protection system in Nigeria. To address the financial difficulties during the COVID-19 pandemic, provision of loans and grants should be commenced in an organized fashion.}

abstract = {Propelled by urbanization, rising incomes, and changing diets, food markets have been expanding in Africa and South Asia, creating the vast potential for job and income opportunities along food supply chains and, hence, for poverty reduction. The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) that spread to a pandemic in early 2020 provokes enormous setbacks to this expansion. This, however, should provide lessons regarding the importance of resilient and inclusive food systems. Emergency responses to COVID-19 should consider interventions towards that end and leverage the opportunities provided by food markets growth as economies recover from the present economic recession. This paper assesses options of how this could be done by facilitating the better functioning and interconnectedness of the many small and medium-sized enterprises that are proliferating along the “hidden middle” of food value chains in storage, logistics, transportation, and wholesale and retail distribution. It also explores how policies can help smallholder farmers connect to this “hidden middle” in more gainful ways and help them climb out of poverty as well.}

This is accomplished by assuming that facilities with surplus capacity/production can cooperate with those facing shortage by transferring part of that capacity/production. Such a transfer incurs a cost that nonetheless may be compensated by savings both in the installation costs and in the distribution costs. Mixed-integer mathematical programming models are proposed for the problem. A distinction is made between the case in which the triangle inequality holds for the transfer costs and the case in which it does not. We present compact models, which are enhanced with valid inequalities that are separated in a branch-and-cut fashion. A comprehensive computational study with several hundreds of instances is reported showing the value of transferring capacities. Overall, this work investigates a problem that is at the core of more comprehensive models emerging in the context of logistics network design.}

In US only 13% of MSW is used for energy recovery and 53% is landfilled. There are 86 WTE facilities that mostly use Mass-Burn and Refuse-Derived Fuel technologies and are concentrated in densely populated northeast (predominantly in New York) and the State of Florida. For the rest of the country most of the MSW ends up in landfills equipped with gas recovery, which is supplied to homes or used for electricity generation. However, there are many pilot and experimental systems based on advanced gasification and pyrolysis processes, which are viewed as potential technologies to respond to an issue of landfills nearing full capacity in various US states. These systems are viewed as “cleaner” (65% less toxic residue) than established mass burn technologies but not matured to commercialization due technical and cost hurdles. Operation and maintenance costs between $40-$100 per ton of MSW were reported for gasification systems. The heterogeneous nature of MSW, gas cleaning and air pollution controls are the main disadvantages. Key design and decision support tools used by the scientific community and major operators in US include: Techno-economic analysis, Life cycle sustainability assessment, and Reverse logistics modeling. A conclusion drawn from reviewed studies is that adoption of thermal WTE technologies in US could continue to increase, albeit slowly, in coastal and urban areas lacking suitable lands for new landfills.}

In this paper, a model of integrated location, routing, and inventory problem, the three key problems in optimizing a logistics system, is introduced. Considering the particular decision-making environment of such industries, we give a two-phase approach to incorporate the three dimensions of sustainability into supply chain practices. After identifying more sustainable-oriented suppliers, a problem is formulated as a multi-objective Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) model to assist in planning a sustainable supply chain. Based on the proposed two-phase approach, we contribute to the current literature by simultaneously addressing different challenges, e.g., sustainability issue, integrated decision-making on location, routing, and inventory control planning, and real-world assumptions to make further advances in both research and practice. Since finding the optimal solution for this problem is a NP-hard problem, two hybrid metaheuristics as parallel and series combinations of Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) are utilized to solve the problem. The implementation of a set of test instances demonstrates the superiority of the parallel hybridization over the series one. Furthermore, it is observed that when the goal of sustainability is approached, manufacturing sector tends to be decentralized and the local commodity production in more medium- and low-developed locations can exhibit the best sustainability performance.}

With the countries gone into lockdown for an unspecified time, it is self-evident that people will run out of food, medicine, and other essentials because of the middleman's unavailability to move products from supply to demand point. Lack of medical infrastructure and distant testing laboratories is another challenge faced by the countries, which result in a delayed testing report leading to delay in medical treatment—such critical problems arising in the fight against COVID-19 highlight the need for improving the efficiency of supply chains. Recently used for commercial purposes, drone technology has already proved its utility in inventory and logistics management. Therefore, we argue that drones could be a viable option to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the supply chains working for humanitarian aid to combat COVID-19. Specifically, the focus is on food, administrative, and healthcare supply chains that are the core to combat the pandemic. Moreover, in this article, we highlight various present and future application areas for drone technology, which could pave the way for future research and industry applications.}

The materials are semi-products supplied by a single supplier, and the transportation of materials are accomplished by a 3PL provider. Semi-products may have different sizes and processing times, and they are processed on a batch-processing facility by the manufacturer. Outbound distribution of final products are accomplished by the same 3PL provider. We consider three different models and propose fast algorithms to solve each model.

Educational activity and setting
The virtual redesign of a Capstone OSCE for third professional year pharmacy students at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Findings
Core components of pivoting an in-person Capstone OSCE to virtual included an initial assessment of what was planned, what competencies were being assessed, and how this could be accomplished in the virtual realm. Key stakeholders such as students, testing and evaluation services, and faculty were included in the planning process. In addition to changes in OSCE delivery, grading processes and remediation were also modified.
Summary
This Capstone OSCE merged virtual education and skills-based assessments together out of necessity and provides an example of flexibility and nimbleness in times of great change. Although further assessment is needed, processes used and lessons learned are helpful for future, intentional planning of virtual or partially virtual skills assessments.}

abstract = {Electric vehicle technology is promising to reduce both the costs and environmental impact of logistics operations. Consequently, much research is being carried out in this field. On the operational level, the electric vehicle routing problem (EVRP) has recently been introduced and deals with forming effective route plans for vehicles while satisfying a set of battery-related restrictions. This paper presents a comprehensive literature review of the EVRP and its extensions. In this context, 136 published papers that consider the routing of battery electric vehicles are reviewed. The EVRP is clearly defined, variations on the basic EVRP are discussed, a mathematical formulation, which also models several simple variations of the problem, is given, and developed solution approaches are discussed in detail. In addition, EVRP benchmark sets are presented, and, lastly, interesting future research directions are discussed.}

We present data on the biochemical properties of a dozen enzymes, all generated by our group, in a comparative fashion. These enzymes display a range of properties in terms of substrate and metal specificities, pH and ammonium requirement, as well as catalytic constants. In addition, we describe a single novel cytochrome, XoxG4, that likely serves as a natural electron acceptor from XoxF5 in methanotrophs of the Gammaproteobacteria class.}

abstract = {Tele-rehabilitation is an alternative to the conventional rehabilitation service that helps patients in remote areas to access a service that is practical in terms of logistics and cost, in a controlled environment. It includes the usage of mobile phones or other wireless devices that are applied to rehabilitation exercises. Such applications or software include exercises in the form of virtual games, treatment monitoring based on the rehabilitation progress and data analysis. However, nowadays, physiotherapists use a default profiling setting for patients carrying out rehabilitation, due to lack of information. Medical Interactive Rehabilitation Assistant (MIRA) is a computer-based (virtual reality) rehabilitation platform. The profile setting includes: a level of difficulty, percentage of tolerance and maximum range. To the best of our knowledge, there is a lack of optimization in the parameter values setting of MIRA exergames that could enhance patients' performance. Generally, non-optimal profile setting leads to reduced effectiveness. Therefore, this study aims to develop a method that optimizes the profile setting of each patient according to the estimated (desired) optimal results. The proposed method is developed using unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques. We use Self-Organizing Map (SOM) to cluster patient records into several distinct clusters. K-fold cross validation is applied to construct the prediction models. Classification And Regression Tree (CART) is utilized to predict the patient's optimal input setting for playing the MIRA games. The combination of these techniques seems to improve the efficiency of the standard (default) way in predicting the optimal settings for exergames. To evaluate the proposed method, we conduct an experiment with data collected from a rehabilitation center. We use three metrics to quantify the quality of the results: R-squared (R2), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The results of experimental analysis demonstrate that the proposed method is effective in predicting the adequate parameter setting in MIRA platform. The method has potential to be implemented as an intelligent system for MIRA prediction in healthcare. Moreover, the method could be extended to similar platforms for which data is available to train our method on.}

abstract = {The aim of this research was to develop a quantitative method for clinicians to predict the probability of improved prognosis in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Data on 104 patients admitted to hospital with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection from 10 January 2020 to 26 February 2020 were collected. Clinical information and laboratory findings were collected and compared between the outcomes of improved patients and non-improved patients. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistics regression model and two-way stepwise strategy in the multivariate logistics regression model were used to select prognostic factors for predicting clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients. The concordance index (C-index) was used to assess the discrimination of the model, and internal validation was performed through bootstrap resampling. A novel predictive nomogram was constructed by incorporating these features. Of the 104 patients included in the study (median age 55 years), 75 (72.1%) had improved short-term outcomes, while 29 (27.9%) showed no signs of improvement. There were numerous differences in clinical characteristics and laboratory findings between patients with improved outcomes and patients without improved outcomes. After a multi-step screening process, prognostic factors were selected and incorporated into the nomogram construction, including immunoglobulin A (IgA), C-reactive protein (CRP), creatine kinase (CK), Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II), and interaction between CK and APACHE II. The C-index of our model was 0.962 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.931–0.993) and still reached a high value of 0.948 through bootstrapping validation. A predictive nomogram we further established showed close performance compared with the ideal model on the calibration plot and was clinically practical according to the decision curve and clinical impact curve. The nomogram we constructed is useful for clinicians to predict improved clinical outcome probability for each COVID-19 patient, which may facilitate personalized counselling and treatment.}

abstract = {Drones are one of the most intensively studied technologies in logistics in recent years. They combine technological features matching current trends in transport industry and society like autonomy, flexibility, and agility. Among the various concepts for using drones in logistics, parcel delivery is one of the most popular application scenarios. Companies like Amazon test drones particularly for last-mile delivery intending to achieve both reducing total cost and increasing customer satisfaction by fast deliveries. As drones are electric vehicles, they are also often claimed to be an eco-friendly mean of transportation. In this paper an energy consumption model for drones is proposed to describe the energy demand for drone deliveries depending on environmental conditions and the flight pattern. The model is used to simulate the energy demand of a stationary parcel delivery system which serves a set customers from a depot. The energy consumed by drones is compared to the energy demand of Diesel trucks and electric trucks serving the same customers from the same depot. The results indicate that switching to a solely drone-based parcel delivery system is not worthwhile from an energetic perspective in most scenarios. A stationary drone-based parcel delivery system requires more energy than a truck-based parcel delivery system particularly in urban areas where customer density is high and truck tours are comparatively short. In rather rural settings with long distances between customers, a drone-based parcel delivery system creates an energy demand comparable to a parcel delivery system with electric trucks provided environmental conditions are moderate.}

To help control spread of this pandemic, many centers, including total joint arthroplasty clinics, have boosted telemedicine capability to care for patients who would typically be seen in person in outpatient settings. We review key components relevant to the establishment and effective use of telemedicine, focused on patient education, practice logistics, technological considerations, and sensitive patient health information–associated compliance factors, which are necessary to provide care remotely for total joint arthroplasty patients.}
