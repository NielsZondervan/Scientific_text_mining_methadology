abstract = {Autologous chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have achieved unprecedented clinical responses in patients with B-cell leukemias, lymphomas and multiple myeloma, raising interest in using CAR T cell therapies in AML. These therapies are produced using a patient's own T cells, an approach that has inherent challenges, including requiring significant time for production, complex supply chain logistics, separate GMP manufacturing for each patient, and variability in performance of patient-derived cells. Given the rapid pace of disease progression combined with limitations associated with the autologous approach and treatment-induced lymphopenia, many patients with AML may not receive treatment. Allogeneic CAR T (AlloCAR T) cell therapies, which utilize cells from healthy donors, may provide greater convenience with readily available off-the-shelf CAR T cells on-demand, reliable product consistency, and accessibility at greater scale for more patients. To create an allogeneic product, the TRAC and CD52 genes are inactivated in CAR T cells using Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nuclease (TALEN®) technology. These genetic modifications are intended to minimize the risk of graft-versus-host disease and to confer resistance to ALLO-647, an anti-CD52 antibody that can be used as part of the conditioning regimen to deplete host alloreactive immune cells potentially leading to increased persistence and efficacy of the infused allogeneic cells. We have previously described the functional screening of a library of anti-FLT3 single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) and the identification of a lead FLT3 CAR with optimal activity against AML cells and featuring an off-switch activated by rituximab. Here we characterize ALLO-819, an allogeneic FLT3 CAR T cell product, for its antitumor efficacy and expansion in orthotopic models of human AML, cytotoxicity in the presence of soluble FLT3 (sFLT3), performance compared with previously described anti-FLT3 CARs and potential for off-target binding of the scFv to normal human tissues. To produce ALLO-819, T cells derived from healthy donors were activated and transduced with a lentiviral construct for expression of the lead anti-FLT3 CAR followed by efficient knockout of TRAC and CD52. ALLO-819 manufactured from multiple donors was insensitive to ALLO-647 (100 µg/mL) in in vitro assays, suggesting that it would avoid elimination by the lymphodepletion regimen. In orthotopic models of AML (MV4-11 and EOL-1), ALLO-819 exhibited dose-dependent expansion and cytotoxic activity, with peak CAR T cell levels corresponding to maximal antitumor efficacy. Intriguingly, ALLO-819 showed earlier and more robust peak expansion in mice engrafted with MV4-11 target cells, which express lower levels of the antigen relative to EOL-1 cells (n=2 donors). To further assess the potency of ALLO-819, multiple anti-FLT3 scFvs that had been described in previous reports were cloned into lentiviral constructs that were used to generate CAR T cells following the standard protocol. In these comparative studies, the ALLO-819 CAR displayed high transduction efficiency and superior performance across different donors. Furthermore, the effector function of ALLO-819 was equivalent to that observed in FLT3 CAR T cells with normal expression of TCR and CD52, indicating no effects of TALEN® treatment on CAR T cell activity. Plasma levels of sFLT3 are frequently increased in patients with AML and correlate with tumor burden, raising the possibility that sFLT3 may act as a decoy for FLT3 CAR T cells. To rule out an inhibitory effect of sFLT3 on ALLO-819, effector and target cells were cultured overnight in the presence of increasing concentrations of recombinant sFLT3. We found that ALLO-819 retained its killing properties even in the presence of supraphysiological concentrations of sFLT3 (1 µg/mL). To investigate the potential for off-target binding of the ALLO-819 CAR to human tissues, tissue cross-reactivity studies were conducted using a recombinant protein consisting of the extracellular domain of the CAR fused to human IgG Fc. Consistent with the limited expression pattern of FLT3 and indicative of the high specificity of the lead scFv, no appreciable membrane staining was detected in any of the 36 normal tissues tested (n=3 donors). Taken together, our results support clinical development of ALLO-819 as a novel and effective CAR T cell therapy for the treatment of AML.

abstract = {INTRODUCTION
A massive transfusion protocol (MTP) is defined as a transfusion which exceeds the patient's estimated blood volume within 24 hours. The use of cold-stored, low-titer Group O whole blood (LTOWB) is well established for massive transfusion in military and civilian trauma. However, we do not yet have data supporting the use of LTOWB for non-trauma patients requiring a massive transfusion. Herein lies the importance of this retrospective cohort study as it seeks to answer important questions about the use of LTOWB in non-trauma patients. The primary aim of the study is to establish if mortality 24h and 30d after LTOWB MTP is no worse than after standard, component MTP. Secondary aims include degree of hemolysis, length of stay and, because there is 5% increase in mortality for every minute that blood products are not provided to a trauma patient after an MTP has been activated, time to delivery.
METHODS
A retrospective chart review identified non-trauma patients requiring a MTP from July 1, 2018 to June 30, 2019, comparing those who received at least one unit of LTOWB (“LTOWB” cohort) to those who received a standard component MTP (“Component” cohort). Each delivery of a component MTP contains 6u of RBCs, 6u of plasma and 1u of platelets. Each LTOWB delivery contains 5u of leukoreduced (using a platelet-sparing filter) LTOWB. Our primary outcomes were 24h and 30d mortality, adjusted for age and Elixhauser comorbidity score. Secondary outcomes included length of stay, hemolysis, and delivery time. Medical records were abstracted for demographics, Total Bilirubin levels, discharge codes, 24h and 30d mortality, and length of stay. Hemolysis was the difference between highest Total Bilirubin in the 5 days following the MTP and the lowest total bilirubin level for the two days prior or on the day of the MTP. Delivery time was calculated as the number of minutes between the time the MTP was ordered in the electronic ordering system and the delivery of the first box of blood products as noted in hospital transportation logs. Discharge codes were used to calculate a weighted Elixhauser comorbidity score as previously described. Statistical analysis was performed utilizing logistic regressions, poisson regression, general linear models, and t-tests as appropriate (Table 2, Table 3).
RESULTS
Between 7/1/2018 and 6/30/2019, 93 unique patients received 114 MTPs, of which 19 received at least one unit of LTOWB (Table 1). Seven patients had emergency-issue blood delivered outside of hospital transportation so were included in the analysis. The indication for the MTP was most commonly gastrointestinal bleeding, followed by intra-procedural bleeding and organ bleeding (spleen, pancreas, retroperitoneum, lung, brain and ovarian). Adjusting for age and Elixhauser comorbidity score, there was no statistically significant difference in 24 h mortality (13.4% higher odds in LTOWB cohort compared to component; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.28, 4.64; p: 0.86) or 30 d mortality (14% higher odds in LTOWB cohort compared to component; 95% CI: 0.34, 3.77; p: 0.83), Table 2. There was no statistically significant difference between cohorts in length of stay (for every 1.0 day patients who received LTOWB were admitted, patients who received components were admitted for 0.97d; 95% CI: 0.86, 1.09; p: 0.58), time to delivery, or degree of hemolysis.
CONCLUSIONS
For non-trauma patients receiving a massive transfusion, our data suggest that receiving at least one unit of LTOWB does not impact 24 h or 30 d mortality. Length of stay and change in bilirubin were nearly the same for both cohorts suggesting that LTOWB is as safe as component therapy. Although we hypothesized that LTOWB would be delivered faster, we have a small sample size and because component MTP is the default at our institution for non-trauma patients, LTOWB was usually delivered only in subsequent deliveries, not the first one. Therefore, we would not expect to see a difference. Although this is a small study from one institution, it is the first investigation of LTOWB in non-trauma patients. Overall, our data indicates that LTOWB may be a reasonable alternative to component therapy outside of trauma as it does not significantly alter patient outcomes but still eases manufacturing and transfusion logistics. Future research is needed to further establish the effects of LTOWB in this population.

abstract = { Background Anemia is common in patients (pts) with myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN)-associated myelofibrosis (MF). Furthermore, anemia is an on-target effect of therapeutic Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) inhibition, and is a frequent cause of ruxolitinib (rux) discontinuation (d/c) in clinical practice (Kuykendall, Ann Hematol 2018). Current therapies for anemia of MF (erythropoietin and analogs, danazol, IMiDs®) are unsatisfactory. Sotatercept (ACE-011) is a first-in-class, activin receptor type IIA ligand trap that may improve anemia by sequestering stromal transforming growth factor beta superfamily ligands that suppress terminal erythropoiesis (Iancu-Rubin, Exp Hematol 2013). Methods This is a phase 2, investigator-initiated, open-label, single institution study of sotatercept, administered subcutaneously every 3 weeks, in 2 cohorts of anemic pts (Hgb <10 g/dl on every determination for 12 w or transfusion-dependent (TD) per IWG-MRT criteria (Tefferi, Blood 2013)) with MF: as a single agent, and in combination with a stable dose of rux. Pts on rux must have been on it for ≥6 months with a stable dose for the preceding ≥8 weeks, and receive sotatercept at a dose of 0.75 mg/kg. Monotherapy pts receive either 0.75 or 1 mg/kg of sotatercept. In both cohorts, anemia response is defined as achievement of transfusion independence (TI) in TD pts, or an increase in Hgb level from baseline of ≥1.5 g/dl sustained for ≥12 wks in non-TD pts (Gale, Leuk Res 2011). Pts must be on-study for ≥12 w (84 d) to be response-evaluable. Results A total of 56 pts have been treated; one pt received only 0.3 mg/kg of sotatercept and is not considered further. Thirty four pts received sotatercept alone and 21 in combination with rux. Baseline characteristics appear in Table 1, panel A. Seventeen TD and 17 non-TD pts received sotatercept alone for a median of 11 (3-73) cycles. Sixteen pts received 0.75 mg/kg and 18, 1 mg/kg. Eight of 27 (30%) evaluable pts responded. Of these, 5 were anemia responses; 3 TD pts achieved TI. Six responses occurred at the 0.75 mg/kg dose, and 2 at the 1 mg/kg dose. Median time to response (TTR) was 19 (1-22) days and median duration of response (DOR), 23.3 (3.9-68.4) months. Seven pts (21%) were on-study for <84 d and hence not response-evaluable: 2 because of stem cell transplant (SCT), 2 due to logistical (travel) issues, and 1 each d/ced sotatercept because of hypertension (HTN), unrelated medical problems and pt decision. Two pts continue on study. Reasons for d/c include lack or loss of response (14), progressive MF (6), SCT (4), travel logistics (3), patient decision (2), hypertension (1), unrelated medical complications (1) and transformation to AML (1). The combination cohort comprised 15 non-TD pts and 6 TD pts. Median rux dose at study entry was 10 (5-25) mg bid. Median number of cycles was 25 (2-49). Six of 19 (32%) evaluable pts in the combination cohort responded, all non-TD pts. Median TTR was 14 (6-147) days and median DOR, 18.2 (3.7-56.8) months. Two pts (10%) were on-study for <84 d and hence not response-evaluable, 1 due to SCT and 1 due to loss of insurance. Two pts remain on study. Reasons for d/c include lack or loss of response (8), SCT (4), progressive MF (3), travel logistics (2), loss of insurance (1) and pt decision (1). Several non-response-evaluable pts in both cohorts achieved ≥1.5 g/dl increments in Hgb from baseline that were not sustained for ≥12 w because of early d/c from the study. An additional pt in the combination cohort required a rux dose increase, leading to failure to sustain a ≥1.5 g/dl Hgb improvement for ≥12 w. Across both cohorts, several responding pts required multiple protocol-specified drug holidays because of Hgb levels ≥11.5 g/dl, with resumption of sotatercept once Hgb was <11 g/dl. Sotatercept was well-tolerated (Table 1, panel B). Grade 3 adverse events possibly related to sotatercept were HTN (n=7) and limb (bone/muscle/joint) or back pain (n=2). Conclusions Sotatercept is safe and effective against anemia of MPN-associated MF, both in non-TD and TD pts, with a response rate of 30% when used alone and 32% when used in conjunction with a stable dose of rux. All responses in the rux cohort occurred in non-TD pts. The trial (NCT01712308) has been closed to new pt enrollment. Figure 1

abstract = {BACKGROUND GVHD and non-relapse mortality (NRM) remain frequent complications of HLA-matched HSCT despite the use of standard immunosuppression like tacrolimus and methotrexate. Alternative GVHD prophylaxis (PPX) strategies like T-cell depletion and post-transplant cyclophosphamide negatively impact relapse, infection, and organ toxicity, and no strategy has yet demonstrated a clear benefit for GVHD-free survival. Orca-T is an investigational cellular product comprising stem and immune cells that leverages highly purified donor regulatory T cells to control alloreactive immune responses. Unlike point-of-care graft engineering approaches, Orca-T is produced in a central GMP laboratory and has been successfully distributed to multiple centers across in the U.S. Early clinical trials using Orca-T showed a good safety profile, promising GVHD control, and potentially improved immune reconstitution. Here, we present trial results from both a single-institution Phase 1/2 trial that has completed enrollment and an ongoing multicenter Phase 1b trial. METHODS As of 28 July 2021, 113 patients aged 18-72 have received Orca-T for AML, ALL, MDS, lymphoma, or myelofibrosis. We present here data from 80 patients that have ≥90 days follow-up. 28 and 52 patients, respectively, received Orca-T followed by single-agent GVHD prophylaxis on a single-center Phase 2 study (NCT01660607) and a multicenter Phase Ib (NCT04013685). Orca-T products were derived from HLA-matched related (n=46) or unrelated (n=34) donors. Patients received a variety of myeloablative conditioning regimens (e.g., non-TBI, n=66; TBI-based, n=14) followed by single-agent PPX with either tacrolimus (n=73) or sirolimus (n=7). Median follow-up for these patients is 541 days (single-center) and 248 days (multicenter). We identified a contemporaneous SOC cohort, and we reported on their clinical outcomes at Stanford (n=95) with both matched related (n=52) and unrelated (n=43) transplant recipients who received unmanipulated PBSC products (median f/u 546) and methotrexate plus tacrolimus prophylaxis. RESULTS The Orca-T investigational cell therapy was manufactured reliably, delivered in less than 72 hours for all patients, and every patient enrolled received Orca-T. The Treg drug product was characterized by high Treg purity of 93.8% +/- 3.1% and a dose of 2.6 +/- 0.4 x 106 per kg (equivalent between trials). An Orca-T product was produced and infused for all patients, and there were no logistics failures or infusion reactions. All patients engrafted and Orca-T patients showed earlier neutrophil (median of 12 days vs. 14 days, p<0.0001 by Mann-Whitney U) and platelet engraftment (14 vs 17 days, p<0.0001) compared to SOC. On the single-center, Phase 2 clinical trial study at Stanford there is evidence of improved 1-year GVHD and relapse-free survival (GRFS) which was 77% (CI 51-88%) for Orca-T patients vs 34% (CI 25-44%) with SOC (Figure 1A). We observed improved rates of >grade 2 acute GVHD at Day +180 (aGVHD, 14% versus 33%), moderate-to-severe chronic GVHD at 1 year (4% versus 42%) and NRM at 1 year (0% versus 13%). Relapse-free (RFS) and overall survival (OS) trended upwards for Orca-T. Severe infectious complications were rare. Key clinical results from both Orca-T trials are summarized in Table 1; 23 of 80 patients had ≥1 year follow-up. Consistent with findings from the single-institution study, on the multicenter study, rates of moderate-to-severe cGVHD and non-relapse mortality were low at 1-year post-transplant at 3% and 4%, respectively. For all patients who received Orca-T across both studies, we observed GRFS of 72% (Figure 1B), RFS of 78%, and OS of 91% at 1 year. These survival rates compare favorably to the contemporaneous SOC control (33%, 71% and 78%, respectively). Immune reconstitution in Orca-T patients with single agent tacrolimus appears similar to SOC except for observable differences in the IL-2 pathway. CONCLUSIONS Manufacture of high precision Orca-T investigational cell therapy drug products was scaled in a central GMP with reliable distribution to centers. Patients that received Orca-T and single-agent PPX showed significantly reduced aGVHD, cGVHD and NRM. Orca-T shows promise to improve GRFS and other transplant outcomes. Orca-T has been granted Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy status by the FDA, and a phase 3 prospectively, randomized study is planned. Figure 1

abstract = {Background Anemia is common in patients (pts) with myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN)-associated myelofibrosis (MF). Furthermore, anemia is an on-target effect of therapeutic Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) inhibition, and may be the most frequent cause of ruxolitinib (rux) discontinuation (d/c) in clinical practice (Kuykendall, Ann Hematol 2018). Current therapies for anemia of MF (erythropoietin and analogs, danazol, IMiDs®) are unsatisfactory. Sotatercept (ACE-011) is a first-in-class, activin receptor type IIA ligand trap that may improve anemia by sequestering stromal transforming growth factor beta superfamily ligands that suppress terminal erythropoiesis (Iancu-Rubin, Exp Hematol 2013). Methods This is a phase 2, investigator-initiated, open-label, single institution study of sotatercept, administered subcutaneously every 3 weeks, in 2 cohorts of anemic pts (Hgb <10 g/dl on every determination for 12 weeks (wks) or transfusion-dependent (TD) per IWG-MRT criteria (Tefferi, Blood 2013)) with MF: as a single agent, and in combination with a stable dose of rux. Pts on rux must have been on rux for ≥6 months with a stable dose for ≥8 weeks, and receive sotatercept at a dose of 0.75 mg/kg. Monotherapy pts receive either 0.75 or 1 mg/kg of sotatercept. In both cohorts, anemia response is defined as achievement of transfusion independence (TI) in TD pts, and an increase in Hgb level from baseline of ≥1.5 g/dl sustained for ≥12 wks in non-TD pts (Gale, Leuk Res 2011). Pts must have received ≥5 cycles of sotatercept to be response-evaluable. Results A total of 53 pts have been treated; one pt received only 0.3 mg/kg of sotatercept and is not considered further. Thirty one pts received sotatercept alone and 21 in combination with rux. Baseline characteristics appear in Table 1, panel A. Sixteen TD and 15 non-TD pts received sotatercept alone for a median of 5 (1-67) cycles. Thirteen pts received 0.75 mg/kg and 18, 1 mg/kg. Seven of 24 (29%) evaluable pts responded. Of these, 4 were anemia responses; 3 TD pts achieved TI. Five responses occurred at the 0.75 mg/kg dose, and 2 at the 1 mg/kg dose. Median time to response (TTR) was 21 (1-22) days and median duration of response (DOR) 13 (3.9-56.4) months. Seven pts (22.6%) received <5 cycles and were not response-evaluable: 2 proceeded to stem cell transplant (SCT), 2 had logistical (travel) issues, and 1 each d/ced sotatercept because of hypertension (HTN), unrelated medical problems and pt decision. Three pts continue on study. Reasons for d/c included no response (11), progressive MF (6), SCT (3), travel logistics (3), patient decision (2), hypertension (1), unrelated medical complications (1) and transformation to AML (1). The combination cohort comprised 15 non-TD pts and 6 TD pts. The median number of cycles was 8 (2-43). Five of 17 (29%) evaluable pts in the combination cohort responded, all non-TD pts. Median TTR was 14 (7-147) days and median DOR 34.6 (3.1-47.9) months. Four pts (19%) received <5 cycles and were not response-evaluable, 1 each due to MF progression, loss of insurance, SCT and pt decision. Five pts remain on study. Reasons for d/c included no response (6), SCT (4), progressive MF (2), travel logistics (2), loss of insurance (1) and pt decision (1). Several non-response-evaluable pts in both cohorts achieved ≥1.5 g/dl increments in Hgb from baseline that were not sustained for ≥12 wks because of early d/c of sotatercept. An additional pt in the combination cohort required a rux dose increase, leading to failure to sustain a ≥1.5 g/dl Hgb improvement. Across both cohorts, several responding pts required multiple protocol-specified drug holidays because of Hgb levels ≥11.5 g/dl, with resumption of sotatercept once Hgb was <11 g/dl. Sotatercept was well-tolerated (Table 1, panel B). Grade 3 adverse events possibly related to sotatercept were HTN (n=7), limb (bone/muscle/joint) pain (n=3) and headache (1). Conclusions Sotatercept is safe and effective against anemia of MPN-associated MF, both in non-TD and TD pts, with a response rate of 29% both when used alone and in conjunction with a stable dose of rux. A total of 60 pts are planned to be treated on this trial (NCT01712308).

abstract = {Synthetic T cell redirecting therapies, using chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells or CD3-bispecific antibodies targeting B-cell surface antigens such as CD19 and CD20, currently in clinical development, are emerging as promising, potential therapeutic approaches for the treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). CD3-bispecific antibodies and first generation CAR-T cells only provide T cell receptor stimulation, so-called “signal 1”, to the redirected T cells, but lack costimulatory, so-called “signal 2”, support of those T cells. Agonism of costimulatory receptors on T cells, such as CD28 and/or 4-1BB, can increase the strength and durability of a T cell-mediated response via multiple mechanisms. Co-stimulation can enhance T cell specific cytotoxicity, proliferation, secretion of Th1-polarizing cytokines, recruitment of additional T cells via increased chemokine secretion, T cell metabolic fitness, and resistance to T-cell exhaustion and to activation-induced T-cell death. Indeed, 2nd generation CAR-T cells that incorporate CD28 or 4-1BB co-stimulation have replaced 1st generation ones in clinical development. However, complex manufacturing logistics and the need of specialized clinical centers for the administration of CAR-T cells significantly limit their broad application. In order to provide an off-the-shelf, synthetic T cell redirection approach delivering both signals 1 and 2 to T cells, CD3-bispecific antibodies would need combination with systemically administered T-cell costimulatory agonists. Yet, clinical development of 1st generation costimulatory agonists has not been successful to date due to on-target, off-tumor immune-mediated toxicity, such as hepatotoxicity. To overcome this limitation, we have generated a novel 4-1BB costimulatory agonist, CD19-targeted 4-1BBL (CD19-4-1BBL, RG6076, RO7227166), and are developing it in combination with a potent CD20xCD3 T cell bispecific antibody, CD20-TCB (RG6026 or glofitamab). CD19-4-1BBL consists of a trimeric, human 4-1BBL fused to a monovalent CD19-targeting IgG1 antibody with an engineered Fc region devoid of FcgR binding. As effective agonism of 4-1BB receptor requires crosslinking of more than three receptor units on a T cell, CD19-4-1BBL is systemically inactive unless it binds to CD19 and clusters on the surface of targeted B-cells to hyper-crosslink multiple 4-1BB receptors on redirected T cells. In our off-the-shelf, combination approach, glofitamab binds to CD20 on B-cells and engages CD3 on redirected T cells, providing signal 1 and inducing the expression of 4-1BB on those T cells. CD19-4-1BBL can then target those activated T cells and provide them with signal 2. In preclinical experiments, we show that CD19-4-1BBL can boost glofitamab-mediated cytokine release by activated T cells in healthy donor as well as DLBCL patient-derived PBMCs. Using a human diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) tumor-bearing (WSU-DLCL2) fully humanized mouse model, we observed a CD19-4-1BBL dose-dependent, synergistic combination effect with glofitamab, leading to strongly increased T cell accumulation in tumors, tumor growth inhibition and regression. Importantly, CD19-4-1BBL was also able to prevent tumor escape to glofitamab monotherapy at late treatment time points in a fully humanized mouse model bearing large OCI-Ly18 human DLBCL tumors. Glofitamab monotherapy has recently demonstrated encouraging activity in relapsed/refractory NHL patients with reported complete response rates in DLBCL in the same range as those of 2nd generation CAR-T cells that already incorporate both T cell signals 1 and 2. The preclinical data we report here provide a strong rationale for adding CD19-4-1BBL-mediated T cell signal 2 to glofitamab in the clinic to further boost treatment efficacy and deliver an off-the-shelf, enhanced T cell redirection approach alternative to CAR-T cell therapy. CD19-4-1BBL is currently in clinical trials (NCT04077723).

abstract = {Background
HPV induces many alterations in CDK4-Cyclin D-Rb and apoptotic pathways such as up-regulation of p16, loss of Rb and p53 functions in SCCHN carcinogenesis. Loss of p16 expression is known as a poor prognostic marker in SCCHN for survival. Palbociclib is a highly selective inhibitor of CDK4/6 by blocking Rb phosphorylation with radiosensitizing activity in preclinical studies. Addition of palbociclib to cetuximab and IMRT provides a strong rationale to improve efficacy of treatment in locally advanced SCCHN, especially in p16/HPV-negative tumour.
Methods
This is a phase I study designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and toxicity of palbociclib, cetuximab, and IMRT, using a classical 3+3 design (NCT03024489). The study included locally advanced SCCHN of oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx, and hypopharynx. Palbociclib dose was escalated with 3 dose levels (DLs), starting from 75 to 125mg/d orally for 21day-on and 7day-off for 2 cycles. For all DLs, cetuximab was administered at 400mg/m2IV on day -7 and then 250mg/m2weekly for 7 weeks. IMRT was delivered 5day-on and 2day-off with a total dose of 70Gy for 33 fractions. MRI and PET scans pre- and post-treatment was used to evaluate preliminary efficacy.
Results
A total of 13 eligible patients were enrolled in the dose escalation cohort. No MTD was observed. One DLT, febrile neutropenia (FN) was reported in 1 of 7 patients who received 125mg of palbociclib (DL3) at the 6thweek of IMRT. The FN recovered without G-CSF support within 7 days after discontinuation of palbociclib. Overall, toxicities were related to cetuximab and IMRT. Complete response was observed in 7 of 10 evaluable patients (70%), while overall objective response was demonstarted in 9 of 10 patients (90%).
Conclusions
The recommended phase 2 dose was palbociclib 125mg/d for 21 days on and 7 days off with full standard dose of cetuximab and IMRT for locally advanced SCCHN. MTD was not achieved. The combination was well tolerated with promising preliminary efficacy. The expansion cohort of palbociclib 125mg/d is currently accruing up to 15 locally advanced p16-negative SCCHN patients.

abstract = {Background At our center we consider most patients with newly-diagnosed AML or MDS-EB2 to be candidates for clinical trials. The NCI website (clinicaltrials.gov) currently lists 72 adult trials implying uncertainty as to which is best. These trials often have arbitrary exclusion criteria, and even if eligible, not every patient may enroll in a given trial. Other sources of clinical trial selection bias include physician or patient preferences and logistical issues such as transportation or insurance coverage. These selection biases may contribute to the well-known difficulties in reproducing “promising” findings from early phase trials in subsequent larger studies. At our center we use a pre-determined treatment assignment scheme to allocate clinical trials to patients prior to the initial physician-patient consultation, which may increase trial enrollment and decrease bias in trial assignment. To assess selection bias, we examined how often the assigned treatment was given to patients. Methods A randomly-ordered, physician consensus-derived clinical trial list was created and updated as protocols opened and closed. Trials initiated by our investigators appeared more often on the list than trials sponsored by industry partners. Upon a patient's arrival we provided her/his physician a pre-assigned clinical trial based on that patient's age and probability of early death (using the treatment related mortality score, TRM). After being informed of options including other trials, standard care, or supportive care alone, physicians and their patients decided on a treatment. Once a treatment choice was selected, physicians received an electronic survey. In cases where the pre-assigned clinical trial was not chosen, the survey inquired about reasons for this decision. Categories were: (a) patient ineligible, (b) protocol not accruing, (c) patient and/or physician preference and (d) logistics, e.g. patient cannot stay in Seattle for length demanded by protocol) or (e) insurance denial. Results From December 2017 through June 2019, we collected surveys on 158 out of 170 (93%) arrivals for whom treatment decisions were made. The pre-assigned therapy was given in 40/158 cases (25%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 19-33%). In all 40 cases the trial chosen were ones initiated by investigators here. Twenty-four of the 118 patients (21%) in whom the assigned therapy was not given chose to be treated at home or receive palliative care only. Reasons the remaining 94 patients did not receive their assigned therapy were: physician/patient preference (51), protocol not accruing (18), logistical issues (13), and ineligibility (12 patients). Among patients not enrolled on the assigned trial due to physician/patient preference, 27 of 51 received treatment on an alternate clinical trial, and 24 received standard therapy. The intensity of the therapy was identified by the treating physician as a factor leading to the alternate treatment choice in 35 of 51 patients (67%). In 21 patients in whom a less intense therapy was assigned, intense therapy was given instead; while the opposite occurred in 14 patients. In 16 cases the preferred intensity was the same as that assigned but a different regimen was used. The median TRM score was lower among patients given high intensity vs. intermediate/low intensity treatments (medians 3.75 for high vs, 10.05 for low; Kruskal Wallis p < 0.00001). Discussion and conclusion The pre-assigned therapy was given to 25% of patients (40/158), rising to only 31% (40/128) after removing cases where the protocol was not enrolling or the patient ineligible. Factors possibly contributing to these low rates are the number, nature and specifics of the available protocols, the characteristics of the patients referred to us (e.g. distance from Seattle to their homes), availability of acceptable alternative treatment in a local setting, and characteristics of our physicians (e.g. inherent preferences for higher or lower intensity therapy). The low rate with which pre-assigned treatments were given suggests the continued presence of considerable selection bias when treatment decisions are made. The possibility of such bias should be kept in mind when interpreting the results of clinical trials. Improvements in care of AML patients will require trials to enroll patients representative of the population in need of treatment.
