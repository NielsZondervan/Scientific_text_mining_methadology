abstract = {In the era of smart manufacturing, autonomous mobile robots have become affordable for numerous companies, although the fleet management remains a challenging problem. A novel approach is proposed, supporting the solution of vehicle assignment problem. The method relies on adaptive workstation clustering that considers not only complex environment layout, but also the main characteristics of the material flow. The technique combines network analytical and optimization tools with a greedy algorithm of refinement. The implementation is presented, and the impact of clustering techniques on selected performance metrics are analyzed within a series of experiments, taken from an industrial case study.}

abstract = {In the United States, natural disasters have seriously affected the country’s economy as well as people. They have also been challenging the country’s emergency response capacity. In order to reduce the damage caused by disasters, there is a need for the proper planning and efficient management of relief supplies in place before the onset of a disaster. This paper proposes to integrate the decision making of supplier selection into the preparedness stage in responding to disasters for timely distribution of relief supplies. Agreement terms including the commitment quantity of the relief agency, the reserve capacity of the suppliers, and the quantity discount rate are considered. Compared to the traditional two-stage stochastic programming approach, which is commonly used in the field of humanitarian logistics, a multi-stage stochastic programming model is presented because of the stochastic nature of the proposed problem, and the need to make sequential decisions over time. In this research, a real-world setting which considers disasters such as earthquakes, floods and hurricanes in the mainland United States is used as a case study. The sensitivities of the model for variation of parameters are also studied. This paper provides the relief agencies insights on how the agreement terms affect the supplier selection decision, and how the total expected costs of having an agreement in place and procuring relief items from the suppliers can be minimized.}

Restricting vehicle dwell time is widely used to manage commercial vehicle parking behavior. However, there is insufficient data to help assess the effectiveness of these restrictions. This makes it difficult for policymakers to account for the complexity of commercial vehicle parking behavior. The current study aims to identify factors correlated with dwell time for commercial vehicles. This is accomplished by using generalized linear models with data collected from five buildings that are known to include commercial vehicle activities in the downtown area of Seattle, Washington, USA. Our models showed that dwell times for buildings with concierge services tended to be shorter. Deliveries of documents also tended to have shorter dwell times than oversized supplies deliveries. Passenger vehicle deliveries had shorter dwell times than deliveries made with vehicles with roll-up doors or swing doors (e.g., vans and trucks). When there were deliveries made to multiple locations within a building, the dwell times were significantly longer than dwell times made to one location in a building. The findings from the presented models demonstrate the potential for improving future parking policies for commercial vehicles by considering data collected from different building types, delivered goods, and vehicle types.}

To illustrate our theoretical work, we apply the model to a real dataset from the 2015 Nepal earthquake response. For this case, our method results in a considerable reduction of logistics costs.}

More in detail, the proposed approach is based on the use of a shared city warehouse managed by a network of pharmacies where it is possible to pick up the missing drugs. The paper develops a pharmacy supplying method based on an incentive system to engage pharmacists in the drug distribution process. An interactive drug distribution algorithm, based on an Integer Linear Programming problem, is proposed to minimize the external and transport costs. Finally, a case study is introduced, and the method efficiency is shown through the related simulations.}

This does not suitably address the practical industrial demand, where the oil spill risk in nature dynamically depends on the motion of oil films. To better simulate the reality, this paper aims to conduct a study on a novel dynamic multi-objective location-routing model with split delivery considering practical characteristics, such as the time-varying demands of contaminated areas, uncertainty in the state of associated transportation networks and interrelationship between the changes in spilled oil films and emergency operations, which all result from the dynamic motion of oil films at sea. To address model complexity, we propose a two-stage optimization model, whereby a hybrid heuristic algorithm is developed to obtain Pareto solutions. To demonstrate the proposed model and approaches, a case study involving a series of sensitivity analyses is presented to highlight the importance of the proposed model and determines its implications.}

Our work develops mathematical models of inventory systems that rely on newly manufactured and recoverable items to satisfy market demand. Specifically, we consider continuous (r, Q) re-ordering policies for single-item inventory systems with stochastic demand and recycling. The first model assumes outsourcing the recovery of used items to a supplier, where returns (collected used items) arrive in random quantities with every order. The second model assumes performing the recovery process in-house; i.e., at the manufacturer's facility. The proposed mathematical framework considers an infinite time horizon where demand and the amount recovered are stochastic. This work focuses on developing environmentally responsible inventory policies/models that could help in greening supply chains. It also presents a numerical study to compare the proposed models and quantify the trade-off cost between the two; i.e., should the recovery process be in-house or outsourced.}

However, the national and sectoral differences in freight transport operations affect the viability of electric trucks. The aim of this paper is to develop a methodology for estimating the potential of electric trucks and demonstrate the results in Switzerland and Finland. Commodity-level analysis of the continuous road freight survey data were carried out in both countries. As much as 71% of Swiss road freight transport tonne-kilometers may be electrified using battery electric trucks but Finland has very limited potential of 35%, due to the use of long and heavy truck-trailer combinations. Within both countries the electrification potential varies considerably between commodities, although in Finland more so than in Switzerland. Commodities which are constrained by payload volume rather than weight and are to large extent carried using medium duty or <26t rigid trucks trucks seem to provide high potential for electrification even with the current technology. Electric trucks increase the annual electricity consumption by only 1–3%, but truck charging is likely to have a large impact on local grids near logistics centres and rest stations along major roads. A spatial analysis by routing the trips reported in the datasets used in this study should be carried out. Future research should also include comparison between the alternate ways of electrifying road freight transport, i.e. batteries with charging, batteries with battery swapping and electrified road systems.}

Each order comprises a delivery point and an ideal delivery time An order is considered on time if it is delivered within a certain given time interval around the ideal delivery time. All food is prepared in a single production facility (restaurant) and immediately carried to the customers by a single courier, who may dispatch one or two different orders in a single trip. Since late deliveries correspond to canceled orders and an economic loss for the company, it is of interest to schedule orders so that the number of late orders is minimized. We model the resulting decision problem as a special single machine scheduling problem and propose different mixed integer programs to solve it. Their performance is assessed through a computational study on a set of test instances derived by our real-world application.}

Reported bulk density for fresh willow chips ranges between 195 and 393 kg m−3 and it is unknown if standardized methods using several kg of chips scale effectively to collection vehicles that contain several Mg. The objective of this study was to compare three bulk density methods for 53 commercially harvested willow loads and compare bulk density in three different collection wagons. An ISO standard ‘bucket’ method was compared to actual and effective bulk density measurements. Mean as-received bulk density using the standard ISO method was 262 kg m−3 (σ = 25) and was not correlated with wagon load measurements of actual or effective bulk density. The actual bulk density in a small (10 m3) collection vehicle was 302 kg m−3 (σ = 32), which was significantly greater than the 214 kg m−3 (σ = 28) that was measured in two larger (30 m3) collection vehicles. In addition, actual bulk density in wagons was higher than the effective bulk density (247 kg m−3 (σ = 24)) observed for the truck deliveries. Collection wagon geometry and design impacted these results, which may have implications for modeling these systems. The variation in bulk density values is important to understand and represent in modeling of harvesting and logistics systems in order to capture what is actually occurring in commercial scale operations.}

With the global COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2COVID-19 (COVID-19) epidemic, there is an urgent need for social isolation and the use of individual private transport as per the approved health guidelines. Urban transport, especially public transportation (PT), is among the primary sectors affected due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, novel alternatives for competitive PT services still have to be provided to remain meeting the socio-economic and ecological PT challenges. In this respect, sharing PT vehicles carrying passengers (shared freight-PT) could exploit a significant residual capacity as absorptive capacity is actually reduced. However, such use is based on a large-scale mutualization. The idea of integrating freight in passenger transit networks could be efficient within a Physical Internet (PI or π) framework for improving system monitoring, operational performance and, user comfort. This paper explores the major trends in the theory and practice of shared transport systems, in terms of passengers and freight, and suggests a PI conceptual framework to check if we could promote such logistics. In exploring the PI approach, a number of proposals appear providing answers and advance researches towards shared freight-PT.}

Changes in respiratory mechanics cause expiratory flow limitation, atelectasis, and V̇/Q̇ mismatch with resultant hypoxemia. Altered work of breathing and obesity hypoventilation syndrome may cause hypercapnia. Challenging mask ventilation and peri-intubation hypoxemia may complicate intubation. Patients with obesity are at increased risk of ARDS and should receive lung-protective ventilation based on predicted body weight. Increased positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP), coupled with appropriate patient positioning, may overcome the alveolar decruitment and intrinsic PEEP caused by elevated baseline pleural pressure; however, evidence is insufficient regarding the impact of high PEEP strategies on outcomes. Venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may be safely performed in patients with obesity. Fluid management should account for increased prevalence of chronic heart and kidney disease, expanded blood volume, and elevated acute kidney injury risk. Medication pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics may be altered by hydrophobic drug distribution to adipose depots and comorbid liver or kidney disease. Obesity is associated with increased risk of VTE and infection; appropriate dosing of prophylactic anticoagulation and early removal of indwelling catheters may decrease these risks. Obesity is associated with improved critical illness survival in some studies. It is unclear whether this reflects a protective effect or limitations inherent to observational research. Obesity is associated with increased risk of intubation and death in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Ongoing molecular studies of adipose tissue may deepen our understanding of how obesity impacts critical illness pathophysiology.}

If all interested parties work together it will be possible for the sector to develop the necessary processes, skilled staff and infrastructure needed as more treatments move from clinical trial to marketed products.}

abstract = {During an emergency response to a major oil spill accident, the features of the motion of the oil films affect the response decisions. A highly dynamic optimal solution is needed to tackle the continuous changes in the demand for emergency resources and transportation networks for logistics deliveries that must occur. To effectively balance the responsiveness and the total response cost in emergency operations, this paper proposes a dynamic multi-objective location-routing model to address new challenges, such as the time-varying conditions in the response to oil spills and the interrelationship between the decision-making environment and emergency operations. Since the problem is NP-hard, to efficiently obtain Pareto solutions, a novel implementation of a heuristic framework based on particle swarm optimization is developed to conduct numerical experiments. Additionally, to handle the multi-objective model, an alternative solution based on the cost performance method is adopted to help decision makers select the ideal options for Pareto solutions. A case study of a major oil spill accident that occurred in the Bohai Bay is conducted to demonstrate the application of the proposed model and approaches and the real-world implications.}

On a global scale, most resources are currently consumed in cities, contributing to the economic importance of urban freight transport as well as its poor environmental performance. However, there is a lack of knowledge about how to correctly quantify the environmental efficiency of urban freight systems. In this context, this paper proposes a new methodology for evaluating the environmental performance of urban freight transport systems by applying the Overall Greenness Performance (OGP) tool. OGP is a lean-based hierarchy of metrics that uses the value-added concept to relate a company’s productivity with its environmental performance. The proposed methodology uses a mixed-integer linear programming model to assess the environmental impact of the activities and/or requirements in an urban freight transportation system. This paper examines how company context, the supply chain and value stream activity types, namely value adding, necessary but non-value adding and non-value adding, affect a system’s performance, operational costs and environmental impact. Real data from the city of Bogotá, Colombia, were used to validate this approach. A sensitivity analysis was performed with different companies, demands and costs in order to evaluate the trade-offs between economic performance and environmental impact.}

abstract = {In this paper we consider a distribution planning problem in a transshipment network under stochastic customer demand, to account for uncertainty faced in real-life applications when planning distribution activities. To date, considerations of randomness in distribution planning networks with intermediate facilities have received very little attention in the literature. We address this gap by modeling uncertainty in a distribution network with an intermediate facility, and providing insight on the benefit of accounting for randomness at the distribution planning phase. The problem is studied from the perspective of a third-party logistics provider (3PL) that is outsourced to handle the logistics needs of its customers; the 3PL uses a consolidation center to achieve transportation cost savings. We formulate a two-stage stochastic programming model with recourse that aims to minimize the sum of transportation cost, expected inventory holding cost and expected outsourcing cost. The recourse variables ensure that the problem is feasible regardless of the realization of demand, by allowing the option of using a spot market carrier if demand exceeds capacity. We propose a flow-based formulation with a nonlinear holding cost component in the objective function. We then develop an alternative linear path-based formulation that models the movement of freight in the network as path variables. We apply Sample Average Approximation (SAA) to solve the problem, and show that it results in reasonable optimality gaps for problem instances of different sizes. We conduct extensive testing to evaluate the benefits of our proposed stochastic model compared to its deterministic counterpart. Our computational experiments provide managerial insight into the robustness and cost-efficiency of the distribution plans of our proposed stochastic model, and the conditions under which our model achieves significant distribution cost savings.}

In a computational study using a wide range of benchmark instances from the literature, we investigate both the efficiency of the approach as well as the benefit and cost of robust solutions.

While traditional hub location problems have been employed for developing network designs for many specific applications, their general assumptions – such as full connectivity, uniform transfer mode, and direct connections between access nodes and hubs – restrict their direct applicability to real-world logistics problems in several ways. In many network design contexts, the usage of versatile transfer modes and hubs is required due to different pricing of modes and topological considerations. In this paper, we extend the traditional hub location problem by incorporating three transfer modes and two kinds of hubs. As an important additional modification, we do not assume that the underlying network is fully connected, or that hubs and access nodes are directly connected. The context for our modelling is intermodal container movements in an archipelago. We develop and formulate an intermodal hub location problem. We show that this problem is NP-hard. Furthermore, a dataset for intermodal hub location problem is provided, based on a real-world container distribution problem in Indonesia. This dataset involves three modes of transport and a sparse network structure. We perform computational experiments and analyse our computational results. Our model provides insights for decision making and determining pricing policies for the desired levels of network flow.}

A fleet of supply vessels delivers all the necessary equipment and materials to a set of offshore installations from an onshore supply base, according to a delivery schedule or sailing plan. Supply vessels, being the major cost contributor, are chartered on a long-term basis. The planning of supply vessels implies resolving the trade-off between the cost of the delivery schedule and the reliability of deliveries on the scheduled voyages, i.e. the service level. The execution of a sailing plan is affected by stochastic demands at the installations since a high demand fluctuation quite often leads to insufficient vessel capacity to perform a voyage according to the sailing plan. In addition, the average demand level at the installations may change over time, while the number of vessels in the sailing plan remains the same. Maintaining a reliable flow of supplies under stochastic demand therefore leads to additional costs and reduced service level. We present a novel methodology for reliable supply vessel planning and scheduling, enabling planners to construct delivery schedules having a low expected total cost. The methodology involves the construction of delivery schedules with different reliability levels using an adaptive large neighborhood search metaheuristic algorithm combined with a discrete event simulation procedure for the computation of the expected solution cost.}

A case study focusing on a central product and the network surrounding the product is used to illustrate the analytical framework. We employ the analytical framework to show how interaction through resource interfaces of a European rail logistics network play out. Our findings suggest that the analytical framework has the capacity to fruitfully distinguish between the multitude of empirical manifestations and the need for a coherent conceptual framework. It also enables explanations of what may seem paradoxical by exploring the deeper cores of the phenomena.}

abstract = {Modular integrated construction (MiC) is a revolutionary construction method. However, the logistics management of MiC has always been a major barrier to the wider adoption of MiC. Nonetheless, this challenge can be tackled by the application of lean techniques, namely, just-in-time (JIT). Numerous studies have identified and evaluated the critical factors (CFs) required to implement JIT; however, there is no consensus among the previous studies on these CFs and their level of importance. Therefore, this research, for the first time, provides a systematic review and meta-analysis of these CFs. The systematic review identifies 42 CFs. To further provide a synthesis analysis of previous studies, a meta-analysis approach is used. This analysis is conducted on the identified CFs to evaluate their importance level and hence rank them. The results indicate that all the 42 CFs are important for applying JIT, of which seven are highly significant for successfully implementing JIT in MiC. Although the ranking obtained by meta-analysis is much more reliable than that provided in the individual studies, however, there is still a high heterogeneity in the results, which depicts the uncertain nature of the construction field. Therefore, sub-group analysis is conducted to investigate this heterogeneity and uncover the hidden patterns in the literature. This is achieved by studying the influence of predictive factors (moderators) on the importance level of CFs. This analysis shows that the economy of a country and the type of project executed are influential factors. The results further indicate that developing economies, in contrast to advanced economies, should pay more attention to three CFs. Also, the results show that seven CFs are much more important in MiC projects than the other project types. This research work is highly beneficial for theory development and for practitioners by identification of significant CFs that warrant management dedication to best apply JIT. Researchers, in particular, can consider the recommendations given here for implementing future meta-analysis studies.}

Recent research on SSCM in the case sector is limited, and determinants that influence the adoption/implementation of the SSCM practices and their influence on the Operational and Business Performance (OPR) have not been deeply analyzed. The present study tries to bridge this research gap by identifying and analyzing the influence of determinants of SSCM on the OPR of the case supply chain in the Indian context. This study has been carried out in two stages; in the first stage, Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) methodology was employed for establishing the mutual relationship between the determinants. Also, the dependency of OPR on the determinants was identified. Later, in the second stage, primary data on determinants of SSCM and their impact on OPR were collected. Then, the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) methodology was employed for analyzing the data. The ISM approach led to the inference that one determinant namely ‘Regulatory Pressure (RP)’ had the highest driving power; on the other hand, results of the SEM methodology showed that one determinant namely ‘Collaborative Green Logistics (Forward & Reverse) (CGLC)’ had a significant influence on the OPR. These results are intended to guide the researchers and environmentalists as well as government policy- and decision-makers, and organizational managers in understanding the various determinants, their interrelationship and influence on the OPR.}

The supply chain costs such as production costs, distribution costs can be reduced by sharing the information and the service can be improved by quickly responding to the changes in demand. But a practical difficulty is that the channel partners do not like to share complete information about their domain with others. Because, they feel that by doing so, they will lose grip on their domain, and also feel that the shared information could reach their rivals. In this paper, the authors propose a production distribution planning model for a supply chain with partial information sharing. This type of supply chains are found where the third party logistics (3PL) are involved. In 3PL, the transportation facilities (vehicles) are owned by private parties (i.e. they are not owned by plant owners) in this type of distribution, the plant managers and distribution service providers share partial information. They will not share information about their capacities and costs, but share information such as the desired production quantity by the distributors and possible production quantity by the plant managers. Under such situations, the model proposed in this paper is appropriate.. The authors tested the model for problems generated with uniform random numbers between minimum and maximum values for the costs and capacities. The results indicate that the proposed model can be applied to real life problems where third party logistics are involved.}

For the RL process, which is taken as an example, we have detailed the equations implemented in an analytic model to carry out the computation of the economic and environmental sustainability, while for the remaining processes, we present and discuss only the main results obtained. The model was developed under Microsoft Excel™ and is intended to assess the total cost and CO2 emissions of an important company operating as a cold chain logistics service provider. Results of the model show that the highest total cost and environmental impact are due to the product delivery process. Moreover, the results proposed indicate quite clearly the specific activity component where the FCSC managers should intervene to remove or decrease possible inefficiencies and optimize or increase the sustainability of a FCSC.}

Then, we identify and demonstrate several mathematical properties, which we use as dominance properties to implement an efficient resolution algorithm. Our algorithm greatly surpasses the existing optimization methods used for the design optimization problems. The proposed approach allows us to obtain the optimal solution ten times faster than the commonly used methods, as illustrated by a comparative numerical study.}

The order in which vehicles arrive at the terminal can have a significant impact on the efficiency of the packing on the ferry as it may not be possible to place a vehicle in an optimal location if it is not at the front of one of the dockside queues at the right point in the loading process. As the arrival order of vehicles is stochastic, we model the loading process as a two-stage stochastic optimization problem where the objective is to reduce penalties incurred by failing to pack booked vehicles. The first stage consists of optimizing the yard policy for allocating vehicles to dockside queues while the second stage solves the packing problem for a realisation of the arrival process using the yard policy determined in stage one. A novel stage-wise iterative metaheuristic is introduced, which alternates between packing optimization for each of a training set of scenarios whilst fixing the yard policy and optimizing the yard policy whilst fixing the packing solutions. We introduce two novel packing encoders for the second stage packing problem. Termed Sequential Block Packing Encode (SOPE) and General Packing Encoder (GPE), the arrangements they produce are designed to be efficient and easy to implement for loading staff. Results show that the number of yard queues available is critical to the efficiency of the packing on board the ferry.}

Additionally, commodities are categorized according to their characteristics. An external control agent continuously gathers information regarding Supply Chain operation. Using that information, the control agent monitors the inventory of the retailer and assigns the commodity quantity to replenish it, adopting a Model Predictive Control algorithm. Three different formulations of the Model Predictive Control algorithm are designed based on the inventory of the retailer: i) constant inventory, ii) dynamical heuristic inventory, and iii) dynamical control inventory. These formulations are simulated for a Supply Chain operating under a “just-in-time” management policy.}

Last-mile personalized fulfillment can have a catalyst role in the proliferation of the Industry 4.0. This growing trend will reduce standard production, bringing manufacturing closer to the client and, ultimately, boiling down the supply chain to the last mile. However, the literature is not clear about the breakdown of the supply chain to enhance cities’ sustainability and reducing the number of transports and circulating vehicles. Stemming from an empirical study to simulate the existing gap in the market and the development of a case study through structured interviews with privileged interlocutors complemented by the document analysis, this paper highlights how the integration of local stakeholders can efficiently enhance a personalized service based on dynamic collaborations to set up the supply chain, by introducing the Last-Mile-as-a-Service (LMaaS) concept. This concept relies on a revenue-sharing framework based on an open marketplace composed by last-mile manufacturing, transport, and storage assets and stakeholders to disrupt the supply chain, enabling any company to provide personalized products in almost real-time to any location.}

The mobilization and recruitment of SERs is complicated and challenging, since the resources are supplied by diverse organizations and individuals at scattered areas, and meanwhile, the recruitment time is limited. In this paper, for monitoring and managing SERs, an integrated social emergency resources monitoring system (SERMS) is presented to compressively optimize the collection and dispatch of SERs, which integrate resources from variety organizations, non-agreement enterprises and individual donators. A time-bound multi-layer recruitment network of SERs is modeled to maximize the amount of collected resources and minimize the logistics costs. A decomposition and coordination framework for multi-layer network is proposed according to the recruitment times at different layers to optimize the network and reduce the computation complexity. The numerical study demonstrates that by coordinating different layer networks, the relief can satisfy additional 10% demand compared to the result of the network without coordination. The proposed model and framework can also be applied in network design and multi-layer location problem.}

The open vehicle routing problem is a type of classical vehicle routing problem, in which businesses outsource logistics to a third-party company and the vehicles do not return to the depot at the end of their journey. This paper develops a mixed integer linear programming model for two-echelon open vehicle routing problem that integrates city distribution constraints such as time-window and release-time. The release-time refers to the time at which products become ready at satellites for downstream distribution, and it is influenced by limited available resources and work load of each satellite. The proposed model determines the optimal configuration of the routes while minimizing the handling costs, penalty costs, and transportation costs. We use a comprehensive emission model that accounts for load, distance, speed and vehicle characteristics to estimate fuel consumption. Finally, we utilize a numerical example to illustrate the proposed model and explore the effects of release-time on total cost.}

abstract = {Retailers usually apply repetitive weekly delivery patterns when scheduling the workforce for shelf replenishment, defining cyclic transportation routes and managing warehouse capacities. In doing so, all logistics subsystems are jointly scheduled. Grocery products require different temperature zones. As long as transport was in separated vehicles due to temperature requirements, it was not possible to coordinate deliveries across different temperature zones. The recent introduction of multi-compartment trucks has changed this and allows joint deliveries. This simultaneous delivery of multiple product segments impacts repetitive weekly delivery patterns as, for example, low volume segments can be delivered more frequently if they are transported together with high volume segments. We address the problem of defining delivery patterns for delivery with multi-compartment vehicles. After deriving decision-relevant costs, we propose a novel model that defines the Periodic Multi-Compartment Vehicle Routing Problem. The model is solved by an integrated framework that determines delivery patterns within an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search in combination with a Large Neighborhood Search for solving the routing problem. We analyze the impact of selecting delivery patterns across product segments and show the efficiency of our integrated planning approach using numerical studies. Joint planning generates cost savings of up to 15%. Furthermore, we show that the algorithm provided can also improve single-segment problems by 3% compared to a state-of-the art benchmark. Beyond that we demonstrate the applicability and advantage of our approach in a case study with a large German grocery retailer.}

However, studies on the reverse flows of PSC do not capture the diverse routes of end-of-use and end-of-life medicines (EOU/EOL-M) and how the constraints in the forward supply chain processes and operations impact such reverse flows. This research proposes a classificatory review in which three categories of reverse flows are identified: donations, Reverse Logistics (RL) and Circular Economy (CE). Donations are characterized by explicit philanthropic acts involving corporate reputation or by emergency humanitarian action. RL is boosted by regulatory issues and restricted by business imperatives of the PSC. CE is characterized by informal loops of not expired medicines, mainly due to health professionals’ initiatives (although this may not be clear to participants). This classification emerged from content analysis of 2622 references found in six databases, from which 127 were selected. Three questions guided the review in each category: (i) what are the elements of the forward PSC processes that impact PSC reverse flows?; (ii) in what stages of the PSC are the reverse flows identified?; (iii) what does the academic literature recommend for improving PSC reverse flows? The literature shows that excessive amounts and inappropriate types of medicines hinder donations. Inventory planning and quality control problems are the main difficulties for medicines RL. The circularity of EOU-M is affected significantly by frequent changes of patient therapies and health conditions, and by failures of healthcare agents in monitoring prescriptions. The proposed classification suggests that the circularity of not expired medicines is not yet researched in the field of logistics, supply chain and procurement, and it is scarcely considered in engineering, and business and management areas, which evokes a call for future research agenda.}

Reduction in natural resources and raw material reserves, increasing production costs, and the problems caused by an industrial waste landfill and consumer goods have also increased the focus on reverse logistics over the past decade. This paper proposes a municipal solid waste management network in order to minimize different costs. We develop a bi-level mixed integer linear programming model. The lower-level involves location and establishment costs of solid waste collection stations, and the upper-level includes the allocation of waste to the various centers. In order to deal with uncertainty in the amount of collected solid waste, we need to take a scenario-based robust optimization approach into account. The proposed model is evaluated using a case study in Babol, Mazandaran province, Iran. The results indicate that the collection stations are selected in regions that have less distance from their covered regions which leads to the optimal flow of the wastes/products. The proposed robust optimization approach ensures less sensitivity to model solutions for the provided scenarios. In addition, considering hierarchy in this model leads to a more appropriate analysis compared to when a multi-objective model is used.}

Four applications, namely the molecular conformation problem, job-shop scheduling problem, manufacturing cell formation problem, and the vehicle routing problem, are specifically addressed. Large-scale instances of these application problems across multiple scales ranging from molecular design to logistics optimization are computationally challenging for deterministic optimization algorithms on classical computers. To address the computational challenges, hybrid QC-based algorithms are proposed and extensive computational experimental results are presented to demonstrate their applicability and efficiency. The proposed QC-based solution strategies enjoy high computational efficiency in terms of solution quality and computation time, by utilizing the unique features of both classical and quantum computers.}

We develop mixed-integer programs to determine how to allocate fuel to the different regions, the value of prepositioning additional fuel in the current and new locations, and the best fuel volumes to store in different geographical locations. Our models consider both maximizing equity and output. For our case study, we examine how these different strategies could benefit Puerto Rico, given ten recent disasters that have hit this island.

For the last two decades, the concept of urban consolidation centres (UCCs) has been implemented in different cities. UCCs that were started for special subsectors (e.g. construction material handling) are relatively successful; however, general purpose UCCs are not performing well at all. Most UCCs are financially dependent on government support. The UCC concept can be successfully implemented by developing a consistent subsidy or tax scheme aiming to internalize the negative external effects of conventional urban goods distribution. In this paper, we describe and test such policy - a delivery cap and price (DCAP) scenario, combined with a subsidy for a UCC alternative – to reduce carbon emissions for urban goods delivery. The scenario introduces a cap on goods deliveries made to shopkeepers by conventional vehicles, using so-called carbon credit points (CCPs). We demonstrate this policy with a stylized implementation of a city logistics agent based model for the inner city of Rotterdam. The results indicate that this financial scheme could positively influences the use of UCC, ensures its financial viability and significantly reduce the external effects of urban freight transport.}

Distance travelled by equipment and their respective track widths (footprint) determined the track impacted areas under different scenarios. Tracks impacted areas simulated for automatic bale picker (ABP) with several bales/trip (8–23 bales/trip) and areas (1–259 ha) were compared with a control method, using a tractor that can handle 1 and 2 bales/trip. The logistics simulation used the developed more realistic curvilinear method (circular turning paths developed for the harvester, baler, tractor, and ABP) and compared with simpler Euclidean paths. Overall, the impacted areas by the curvilinear method were 1.06–1.29 times the Euclidean for bale aggregation but were not statistically different (p≥ 0.49). Results indicated that the baler followed by harvester produced the least impacted area and ABP the most. Developed prediction models determined the curvilinear track path from Euclidean distances, impacted area from the field area, bales/trip, and biomass yield for different operations, as well as overall operational time fitted well to the results (0.95 ≤R2≤ 0.99). A small ABP of 8 bales/trip (which is also capable of 11 bales/trip) was recommended based on efficient bale aggregation and least impacted area.}

Exploiting data retrieved from the PCS, the methodology combined three data-driven techniques – Process Mining (PM), Social Network Analysis (SNA) and Text Mining – to draw handover social networks among the port logistics players, and to assess the export process efficiency and significant process deviations. Then, two sets of regression models were developed to explore the effects of network dynamics on process performances. Preliminary results point out that the process fragmentation and the frequent communication switching among the port actors could negatively affect the export process efficiency and effectiveness. Finally, the study proposes practical solutions for reducing process fragmentation and improving information exchange among port actors.}

abstract = {Warehouses are an inevitable component in any supply chain and a vividly investigated object of research. Much attention, however, is absorbed by warehousing systems dedicated to the special needs of online retailers in the business-to-consumer segment. Due to the ever increasing sales volumes of e-commerce this focus seems self-evident, but a much larger fraction of retail sales are still realized by traditional brick-and-mortar stores. The special needs of warehouses servicing these stores are focused in this paper. While e-commerce warehouses face low-volume-high-mix picking orders, because private households tend to order just a few pieces per order from a large assortment, distribution centers of retail chains rather have to process high-volume-low-mix orders. We elaborate the basic requirements within both business segments and identify suited warehousing systems for brick-and-mortar stores (e.g., fully-automated case picking). The setup of each identified warehousing system is described, elementary decision problems are discussed, and the existing literature is surveyed. Furthermore, we identify future research needs.}

The analysis has focused on an aspect that has often been overlooked in electric mobility Life Cycle Assessments: the transport of goods in urban environments. The analysis has been performed using primary data from the manufacturer for the production of light-duty vehicles and an ad hoc kinematic model for the use phase. This study has ironed out most of the comparison inequalities that arise in a comparative Life Cycle Assessments of vehicles, comparing three light-duty vehicles, which only differ as far as the powertrain configuration is concerned, during a specific function (the delivery of goods in urban environments), where they have resulted to be mutually interchangeable. The electric motor presents advantages in urban environments, because of the numerous stops and regenerative braking that take place during urban deliveries. Its good performance emerges as the load of the vehicle is increased, thus making the comparison with Internal Combustion Engine Vehicles particularly favorable for Electric Vehicles when it comes to the delivery of goods. During the life cycle of the vehicle, these aspects compensate for the higher impacts of Cumulative Energy Demand, Global Warming, Abiotic Depletion - fossil fuels and Photochemical Oxidation that arise from the production of the electric vehicle. These advantages remain negligible in impact categories driven by resource consumption and manufacturing activities, such as abiotic depletion, acidification and eutrophication. Electric mobility is still hindered in these categories by the cumbersome role of batteries.}

A ranking survey was conducted and analyzed unveiling levels of acceptance to the proposed policies for three types of stakeholders (Carriers, Receivers, and Citizens). Though some methodologies attempt to understand stakeholders’ perspectives towards urban freight policies, often only a certain type of stakeholder is considered; perceptions of Citizens are usually overlooked. The results suggest that stakeholders agree on the importance of having space to conduct freight operations in their urban areas. However, different stakeholders perceive policies differently and local context plays a key role, suggesting that decision-makers must consider these aspects before transferring initiatives from other urban settings. When space for freight operations cannot be provided, the results show that Carriers prefer a Receiver-led Consolidation program, Receivers consider an Urban Consolidation Center as the best alternative, and Citizens prefer Off-hour deliveries. While all of the preferred alternatives call for a more active role played by the other stakeholders, they also call for more sustainable practices and move away from traditional, restrictive policies. The results from this study serve as a tool for planners and decision-makers seeking input on the preferences of various stakeholders to, and the potential acceptability of, urban freight policies.}

In this paper, a high-precision finite element model of small rotor logistics UAVs on the market was built in LS-DYNA. The process to model the connection structure between a range of parts of a UAV was elucidated in detail. The bolt, damping spring and rivet & thread were respectively simulated with “NRB + beam”, “NRB + discrete” and “spot weld”. By a series of static and dynamic material tests, the constitutive parameters of main materials of UAV structure were determined. Besides, a reasonable explicit time step was set by regulating the mass scaling of local elements. To verify whether the finite element model of UAV is accurate, UAV underwent a developed full-scale crash test. As revealed from the experimentally achieved results, the trend of impact load over time in collision simulation significantly complied with the experimentally achieved results, and the discrepancy between the maximum impact load peak and the experimentally achieved results only took up 6.54%. Moreover, the vital damaged parts, damaging process and failure mode of the UAV structure in the crash test were accurately characterized in the collision simulation. Thus, the UAV modeling and collision simulation was verified to exhibit feasibility. Lastly, with the verified UAV high-precision model, the impacting process, possible damaged parts and failure modes of UAV at the variety of angles and speeds were assessed. Accordingly, the proposed high-precision modeling and collision simulation of small rotor UAV is capable of saving the physical and time resources of UAV structural strength experiments, as well as effectively assessing the structural safety and improving the design of small rotor UAVs.}

First, how to model and design a multi-facility, production-logistics system under product demand and energy supply uncertainty? Second, is it economically viable to achieve net-zero energy operations through renewable microgrid integration? To answer both questions, we present a joint production scheduling and microgrid sizing model to decarbonize the manufacturing, transportation and warehousing operations by harnessing onsite wind and solar energy. The integrated planning model is solved as a two-stage optimization program: first, scheduling the production to meet the uncertain demand; second, sizing and siting the microgrid systems to meet the electric load of multiple facilities. The preliminary results show that net-zero energy operation is feasible and affordable in locations where the capacity factor of wind and solar generation exceeds 0.25 and 0.45, respectively. Sensitivity analysis shows that battery system combined with solar photovoltaics is cost-effective despite the high capital cost of storage devices. Two managerial insights are also derived. First, integrating onsite renewable power is the ultimate key to realizing net-zero energy industrial operations. Second, grid-connected microgrid generation with net metering results in lower capacity investment than island operation.}

The European Union Battery Directive stipulates that 50% of LIBs must be recycled and EV manufacturers are responsible for collection, treatment and recycling. The International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road requirement to transport damaged or defective LIB packs in approved explosion proof steel containers imposes expensive certification. Further, the physical weight and volume of LIB packaging increases transport costs of damaged or defective packs as part of a complete recycling or repurposing strategy. Cryogenic flash freezing (CFF) removes the possibility of thermal runaway in LIBs even in extreme abuse conditions. Meaning damaged or defective LIBs may be transported safely whilst cryogenically frozen. Herein, LIBs are cycled until 20% capacity fade to establish that CFF does not affect electrical performance (energy capacity and impedance) during ageing. This is demonstrated on two different cell chemistries and form factors. The potential to remanufacture or reuse cells/modules subjected to CFF supports circular economy principles through extending useful life and reducing raw material usage. Thereby improving the environmental sustainability of transitioning from internal combustion engines to EVs.}

abstract = {Inspired by a problem arising in cash logistics, we propose the Capacitated Routing Problem with Profits and Service Level Requirements (CRPPSLR). The CRPPSLR extends the class of Routing Problems with Profits by considering customers requesting deliveries to their (possibly multiple) service points. Moreover, each customer imposes a service level requirement specifying a minimum-acceptable bound on the fraction of its service points being delivered. A customer-specific financial penalty is incurred by the logistics service provider when this requirement is not met. The CRPPSLR consists in finding vehicle routes maximizing the difference between the collected revenues and the incurred transportation and penalty costs in such a way that vehicle capacity and route duration constraints are met. A fleet of homogeneous vehicles is available for serving the customers. We design a branch-and-cut algorithm and evaluate the usefulness of valid inequalities that have been effectively used for the capacitated vehicle routing problem and, more recently, for other routing problems with profits. A real-life case study taken from the cash supply chain in the Netherlands highlights the relevance of the problem under consideration. Computational results illustrate the performance of the proposed solution approach under different input parameter settings for the synthetic instances. For instances of real-life problems, we distinguish between coin and banknote distribution, as vehicle capacities only matter when considering the former. Finally, we report on the effectiveness of the valid inequalities in closing the optimality gap at the root node for both the synthetic and the real-life instances and conclude with a sensitivity analysis on the most significant input parameters of our model.}

Recently, due to national or European commitments concerning livestock waste management, this waste is being applied in many crops instead of other mineral fertilisers. The organic fertiliser produced has a high availability although most of the crops it is applied to have strict timeliness issues concerning its application. Here, organic fertilizer (as liquid manure) distribution logistic system is modelled by using a combined simulation and linear programming method. The method applies in certain crops and field areas taking into account specific agronomical, legislation and other constraints with the objective of minimising the optimal annual cost. Given their direct connection with the organic fertiliser distribution, the operations of cultivation and seeding were included. In a basic scenario, the optimal cost was assessed for both crops in total cultivated area of 120 ha. Three modified scenarios are presented. The first regards one more tractor as being available and provides a reduction of 3.8% in the total annual cost in comparison with the basic scenario. In the second and third modified scenarios fields having high nitrogen demand next to the farm are considered with one or two tractors and savings of 2.5% and 6.1%, respectively, compared to the basic scenario are implied. Finally, it was concluded that the effect of distance from the manure production to the location of the fields could reduce costs by 6.5%.}

A logistics service provider seeks a repeatable plan to transport commodities from distribution centers on the periphery to inner-city satellites. In a heterogeneous infrastructure, autonomous vehicles in level 4 may only drive in feasible streets but need to be pulled elsewhere by manually operated vehicles in platoons. We formulate an integer program to determine the fleet mix, schedule transportation services, and decide on the routing or outsourcing of commodities. Platooning requires a high level of synchronization between vehicles which demands the time-expanded networks to contain narrow time intervals. Thus, we develop an algorithm based on the dynamic discretization discovery scheme which refines partially time-expanded networks iteratively without having to enumerate the fully time-expanded network a priori. We introduce valid inequalities and provide two enhanced versions of the algorithm that exploit linear relaxations of the problem. Further, we propose heuristic ideas to speed up the search for high-quality solutions. In a computational study, we analyze the efficacy of the algorithm in different versions and observe improvements of computational performance in comparison to a commercial solver. Finally, we solve a case study on a real-world based network to obtain insights into the deployment of a mixed autonomous fleet in an existing heterogeneous infrastructure.}

However, FTG modeling studies in different urban settings have presented wide-ranging results in terms of the relationship between establishment characteristics, freight deliveries, and resultant freight vehicle trips produced and attracted. This study aims to evaluate freight trips generated around retail developments or commercial districts in dense metropolitan areas, commonplace in both emerging and developed cities, which are known to attract high footfall and represent key freight attracting nodes. Establishment-level data was collected from six multi-storey retail malls in the city-state of Singapore and used to develop an aggregated model predicting FTG for retail malls or shopping centres. Using statistical regression, we model the relationship between establishment-specific attributes and deliveries per day, and then evaluate various models that can best predict freight vehicle trips per day to retail malls. This aggregated approach converts the establishment-level freight trip attraction to a building-level freight trip generation by considering trip chaining or the possibility of a carrier delivering to multiple establishments within the building during the same visit or trip. The selected model’s statistical performance is validated with observed freight vehicle arrivals at 16 retail malls. A comparison of the delivery frequency per commercial establishment across different cities is also offered. FTG for these developments is found to be sensitive to the establishment type, employment size, and whether or not the establishments present are branch outlets belonging to a larger retail chain. Contributions from this work can be applied in the evaluation of urban freight logistics initiatives targeted at these locations, and to assess the nontrivial impact that retail developments in cities have on local traffic conditions.}

Almost the 80% of these projects is based on anaerobic digestion. So, it is very important to understand clearly which is the environmental impact of these new bioenergy, or waste to energy, chains (especially at a small scale). For this reason, a Life Cycle Assessment case study is presented in this work, based on an anaerobic digestion plant, fed with the non edible food waste produced by 29 canteens, which operate inside the campus of the Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST). The analyzed impacts are: Climate Change, Acidification, Eutrophication, and Photochemical Oxidation. The functional unit is represented by 1 kWh of produced electricity.

Large trucks can be used to deliver goods to intermediate facilities in accessible locations, whereas smaller vehicles allow to reach the final customers. Due to their reduced size, pollution, and noise, multiple companies consider using an electric fleet of terrestrial or aerial vehicles for last-mile deliveries. Route planning in multi-tier logistics leads to notoriously difficult problems. This difficulty is accrued in the presence of an electric fleet since each vehicle operates on a smaller range and may require planned visits to recharging stations. To study these challenges, we introduce the electric two-echelon vehicle routing problem (E2EVRP) as a prototypical problem. We propose a large neighborhood search (LNS) metaheuristic as well as an exact mathematical programming algorithm, which uses decomposition techniques to enumerate promising first-level solutions in conjunction with bounding functions and route enumeration for the second-level routes. These algorithms produce optimal or near-optimal solutions for the problem and allow us to evaluate the impact of several defining features of optimized battery-powered distribution networks. We created representative E2EVRP benchmark instances to simulate realistic metropolitan areas. In particular, we observe that the detour miles due to recharging decrease proportionally to 1/ρx with x ≈ 5/4 as a function of the charging stations density ρ; e.g., in a scenario where the density of charging stations is doubled, recharging detours are reduced by 58%. Finally, we evaluate the trade-off between battery capacity and detour miles. This estimate is critical for strategic fleet-acquisition decisions, in a context where large batteries are generally more costly and less environment-friendly.}

An enormous amount of obsolete solar PV modules will be added to the waste stream in the near future. Hence, the EoL photovoltaic waste stream could cause an appalling problem in the future if a holistic management strategy is not considered. Despite the vast research on photovoltaic technology, little is known about the perspective of how the EoL PV modules will be handled. The current study systematically investigates global research on EoL PV modules to identify gaps for further exploration. The review reveals that most of the research concentrates on the recovery and recycling of PV panels. Also, the vast majority of the research is mostly carried out in laboratory-scale. The geographical distribution of the studies was concentrated on 15 countries including the USA, Italy, and Taiwan, the latter of which has produced the most publications. Life-cycle-assessment and reverse logistics (RL) are two critical aspects of PV waste management and have only recently received attention from researchers, with 11 and six papers respectively. There are still many countries which have not attempted to forecast their EoL solar-panel waste stream and develop recycling infrastructure. Based on review findings, the future research must be focused on forecasting the PV waste streams, development of recycling technologies, reverse logistics and the policies of individual PV consumer countries. Finally, this study develops a foundation for future research on Photovoltaic waste management to build upon.}

abstract = {Given an increasing pressure to act economically and ecologically efficient, mechanisms to benefit from idle capacities are on the rise. In this “sharing economy”, carrier collaborations are a key concept. We assess the benefit of sharing information in auction-based carrier collaborations where carriers seek to exchange transportation requests in order to decrease vehicle mileage and increase vehicle utilization. Even though carriers are unlikely to share sensitive or business-critical information, they may be willing to share non-sensitive and non-critical information if it increases their profit. We explore the benefit of carriers providing aggregate information about their transportation requests to assist in the selection of transportation requests to enter into the auction, and of carriers providing partial valuation information on the transportation requests that have been entered into the auction. The auction and the information shared are designed and chosen in such a way that carriers feel secure and confident that no sensitive or critical information gets in the hands of the competition. We discuss how the shared information can be exploited within the auction process to enhance the auction's effectiveness and to reduce the cost of decentralization. A computational study demonstrates the value of the additionally shared information. However, the study also illustrates that choosing the (non-revealing) information that is shared has to be done carefully, because otherwise no benefits may be realized.}

abstract = {Due to alarming levels of natural resource consumption and environmental pollution, an urgent reminder to uphold sustainability has prompted the construction industry (CI) to embrace a paradigm shift from a linear to a circular economy (CE) model. Due to the presence of structural holes in the circular supply chain, which means missing relations between parties, useful information is not shared across the supply chain. In this context, a new type of actor, an information broker, has emerged entrusted with bridging the structural holes in the supply chain. While CE has taken root in many industries, with studies exploring their role and characterizing their behaviour, no significant studies have taken place around information brokerages within the CI. This systematic literature review (SLR) aims to synthesize the body of literature to discern information brokers' roles bridging structural holes in the CSC in the CI. A total of 125 articles published between 2002 and 2020 were incorporated and subjected to both descriptive and content analysis. The descriptive analysis revealed that most articles were published in 2019 and originated from China. The study found three types of information brokers and their roles in bridging the structural holes. Three structural holes exist in the CSC: one is between construction and operation stages and two at points where the reverse logistics supply chain (RLSC) links with the forward supply chain. Based on the content analysis findings, a conceptual framework was proposed, contributing to building the foundation of information brokerage for CE in the CI. The study is significant as it explored an overlooked area in the existing literature and put forward the proposition that a collaborative network of information brokers is imperative to steer the CI towards a CE.}

To validate the approach, a validation process of the literature is applied by consulting a selected group of Brazilian harvest planning specialists.

In this study, in the context of urban logistics, we consider a vehicle routing problem with time-dependent travel times and time windows (VRPTW), and the goal is to minimize the total generalized costs including the transportation, waiting time, and fixed costs associated with each vehicle. We adopt a high-dimensional space–time network flow model to formulate an underlying vehicle routing problem (VRP) with a rich set of criteria and constraints. A difficult issue, when solving VRPs, is how to iteratively improve both the primal and dual solution quality in general and how to break the symmetry generated by many identical solutions, particularly with homogeneous vehicles. Along this line, many coupling constraints, such as the consensus constraints across different agents or decision makers, need to be carefully addressed to find high-quality optimal or close-to-optimal solutions under medium- or large-scale instances. Currently, the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is widely used in the field of convex optimization, as an integration of the augmented Lagrangian relaxation and block coordinate descent methods, for machine learning and large-scale continuous systems optimization and control. In this work, we introduce the use of ADMM to solve the multi-VRP, which is a special case of integer linear programming, and demonstrate a manner to reduce the quadratic penalty terms used in ADMM into simple linear functions. In a broader context, a computationally reliable decomposition framework is developed to iteratively improve both the primal and dual solution quality. Essentially, the least-cost path subproblem or other similar subproblems involving binary decisions can be embedded into a sequential solution scheme with an output of both lower bound estimates and upper bound feasible solutions. We examine the performance of the proposed approach using classical Solomon VRP benchmark instances. We also evaluate our approach on a real-world instance based on a problem-solving competition by Jingdong Logistics, a major E-commerce company.}

The call for environmentally-friendly vehicles has been heard by car manufacturers and they have begun to introduce electric commercial vehicles, suitable for logistics tasks, into the market. This trend has also motivated the development of algorithms to plan delivery routes that take the characteristics of electric vehicles into account. In the literature, problems have been studied that consider the distribution of goods with electric vehicles from a central depot. However, many real-world applications have a pickup and delivery structure. In these applications, one needs to plan routes in order to satisfy requests; each request requires that a commodity is transported from a pickup to a delivery location. Here, we study the pickup and delivery problem with time windows and electric vehicles (PDPTW-EV). In the PDPTW-EV, access to locations is restricted by time windows. Electric vehicles, that are constrained by capacities for energy and commodities, serve the routes. Energy can be recharged when stopping at dedicated stations. We develop a granular tabu search (GTS) with a policy to determine the amount of energy recharged. In numerical studies, we validate our approach on small-sized instances, and compare it to the results obtained with a commercial solver. On larger-sized instances, we demonstrate that GTS can handle the partial recharging strategy by comparing it to full recharging. Finally, we show that our algorithm is competitive on benchmark instances of the pickup and delivery problem with time windows.}

abstract = {We consider a scheduling problem for two gantry cranes moving on the same rails at a single storage block. Containers originating at the seaside have to be stored in the block and containers that are already stored in the storage area at the beginning of the planning horizon have to be delivered to the landside handover point within given time windows. Most commonly in seaport operations, the berthing time of vessels is to be minimized. Thus, the objective considered in this article is to minimize the makespan of seaside container processing while guaranteeing on-time processing of landside containers and while considering non-crossing constraints among cranes. We allow preemption of seaside container processing. This means that one crane may move a seaside container to an intermediate storage slot, and the other crane takes it to its designated position. This has previously been shown to be an effective method of reducing the makespan when compared to classical approaches. We present a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm and a related beam search heuristic. The DP method makes use of bounding techniques and applies dominance properties of optimal solutions. In computational tests, we show that the DP approach clearly outperforms CPLEX and that it is able to quickly solve instances with real-world yard settings. The beam search heuristic is shown to be capable of quickly improving solutions of heuristic approaches that have previously been introduced in the literature. This allows both algorithms to be applied in real-world online settings, where container data is revealed incrementally.}

Due to rising public pressure, emission-reducing measures are increasingly likely to be introduced. Such measures can cover diesel bans or even entire car-free zones, causing drastic effects on delivery networks in urban areas. As an option to reduce the risk of a regulation-induced shock, we present a resilience-oriented network and fleet optimization. We propose an innovative parcel delivery concept for last mile delivery (LMD) operations and develop an optimization model to support tactical planning decisions. Our model minimizes overall operating costs by determining optimal locations for micro depots and it allocates transport vehicles to them. An adjustable CO2-threshold and external costs are included to consider potential regulatory restrictions by city authorities. We implement our model into a decision support system (DSS) that allows analyzing and comparing different scenarios. We provide a computational study by evaluating and discussing our DSS with an example of a mid-sized German city. Our results and findings demonstrate the trade-off between cost and emission minimization by quantifying the impacts of various fleet compositions. The proposed logistics concept represents an option to achieve environmentally friendly, cost-efficient, and resilient LMD of parcels.}

Vehicle routing in the model is underlain by the covering tour approach given that such method considerably increases the operational speed of a disaster logistics system, especially in terms of dispatching vehicles that carry essential commodities. Under the approach, vehicles pass through a small number of points where relief centers are established as temporary facilities.

This is crucial to the operational efficiency of unit-load warehouses, which constitute a critical part of a supply chain. We propose a novel approach called the FB method to solve the problem. The FB method is suitable for general receiving-dock and shipping-dock locations that may not coincide. The FB method first ranks the locations according to the frequencies that they are visited, which are estimated by a linear program based on the warehouse’s layout as well as the products’ arrivals and demands. The method then sequentially groups the locations into a number of classes that is implementable in practice. After forming the classes, we use a policy based on robust optimization to determine the storage and retrieval decisions. We compare the robust policy with the traditional storage-retrieval policies on their respective optimized classes. Our results suggest that if the warehouse utilization is low, different class-formation methods may lead to very different total travel costs, with our approach being the most efficient. We observe the robustness of this result across various parameter settings. A case study based on data from a third-party logistics provider suggests that the robust policy under the FB method outperforms the other storage-retrieval policies by at least 8% on average, which indicates the potential savings by our approach in practice. One of our findings is that the importance of optimizing classes depends on the warehouse utilization.}

The objective is to minimize the turnaround times of the vessels.

The framework is analyzed in computational tests that are based on real-world data.

Recently, significant research attention has been focused on the modelling of OSC-SC to improve its performance and sustainability. However, the literature still lacks a comprehensive review of the modelling studies on off-site construction -supply chain management (OSC-SCM). Therefore, this research contributes by providing a comprehensive and up-to-date mapping and clustering of 309 journal articles on the modelling of OSC-SC to identify its trends and gaps, and hence, highlight future research opportunities. To achieve these objectives, a mixed review method, consisting of scientometric and systematic reviews, is used. The scientometric review identifies the most prolific journals, researchers, co-occurrence network of keywords, and their citation bursts. On the other hand, the systematic review classifies the articles based on OSC type and supply chain (SC) stage. At each SC stage, the articles are further classified based on problem settings and solution methods. The results show that production problems have received the most attention (i.e., by 28% of the included articles), followed by on-site construction (19%), design (13%), and logistics (7%) problems. However, researchers are more inclined to address problems at multiple SC stages (33%) due to the interrelationship between these stages. Besides, the systematic analysis shows that OSC-SC problems have been solved frequently by a variety of solution methods such as optimization (25%), simulation (13%) and building information modelling (BIM) (9.5%). However, researchers tend more to integrate multiple solution methods (35%) to address the complexities of OSC-SC problems. Finally, the included studies are classified based on the three sustainability dimensions. The results show that economic, environmental, and social sustainability dimensions have been considered in previous studies by 72%, 24%, and 4%, respectively. Therefore, the study identifies research gaps at each SC stage of each OSC type to incentivize future studies to consider more environmental and social sustainability factors in OSC-SC models. Since modular integrated construction (MiC) has the highest prefabrication level, this study provides future research directions for sustainable supply chain management (SCM) in MiC. The present research is an important reference guide that helps researchers and practitioners to understand different problem settings and their solution methods in OSC-SCM.}

Complex technology such as Additive Manufacturing or generally accepted as 3D printing has received universal interest. Economic growth in Vietnam generates unique infrastructure, logistics services and transportation challenges and opportunities. Logistics are a critically important priority in international trade, foremost in ongoing regional economic expansion. The main objective of this paper is to examine the impact and benefits of advanced technology, affecting logistics services and transportation in Vietnam. This research applied a descriptive survey methodology to gather primary empirical data on the awareness and the willingness to adapt to the technology of organizations focusing on opportunities for the Vietnam market. The results indicated that organizations have a positive attitude towards 3DP impact. The stronger influence was discovered on customization, new customer value proposition, the competitive advantage, and transportation and storage cost reduction. Vietnam is currently one of the most attractive emerging markets in the world. The findings from this research provide timely and valuable new insights into this phenomenon, as a potential mechanism for assisting the revolution of the transportation industry towards improving traffic congestion and pollution.}

abstract = {Suppliers often impose a minimum order quantity (MOQ) to ensure that production runs and shipping quantities of each specific item are economically viable. Additional economies of scale may arise as various items share high joint costs (e.g. the cost of an overseas container shipment) and require coordination of their replenishment policies. The buyer needs to find the joint ordering interval and replenishment policies for each of the individual items to minimize the system-wide ordering and inventory costs while satisfying the quantity restrictions. We focus on the case of constant demand without backlogging. Given a fixed joint reorder interval, we characterize the optimal inventory ordering strategy for each item, which we refer to as Multi-Replenishment (MR) inventory ordering policy, and derive a closed-form expression for the optimal average inventory costs per unit of time. In contrast to the previous literature, the MR inventory ordering policy does not follow the zero-inventory-ordering (ZIO) rule and allows for orders of different sizes over time to optimally accommodate the MOQ restriction. A numerical approach is used to determine the optimal joint reorder interval, and is later extended to account for the presence of empty replenishments. An extensive computational study shows 1) the total inventory and setup cost reduction associated with the MR inventory policies and empty replenishments; 2) the impact of various parameters on cost and policy performance; and 3) the loss associated with discretizing time at different levels of granularity (weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds) to accommodate restrictions in the timing of item deliveries.}

The first method is to place the replicas of data files into computer network nodes. The second method is based on using a redundancy of data files’ replicas (copies and prehistory’s of replicas) in the network nodes. The paper considers formal models of these two methods that are followed by a brief description of the decision-making process to ensure the preservation of data safety. This process is supported by means of an automated complex consisting of two software modules. These modules solve the problem of the optimal use of the two presented methods, ensuring the data safety in distributed systems. Finally, the application of the proposed approach in the design of logistics and transportation systems is discussed.}

The aim of the paper is to support the planning of city logistics measures by means of quantitative evaluations; that could be carried out by public authority to verify sustainability of logistic operations. A laboratory test is implemented in the town of Reggio Calabria (Southern Italy) to assess the effects of a combination of two city logistics measures: a nodal physical measure, such as an UDC, and an equipment measure, specifically Fully Electric Vehicles (FEVs).}

Unlike prior survey papers on pre-disaster and post-disaster humanitarian logistics, our paper has a specific focus on prepositioning of assets and supplies in the domain of natural disasters. The first aim of our paper is to review the main Operations Research and Management Science (OR/MS) journal papers published between 2000 and 2018 on this topic. We have statistically analyzed these papers based on contributions in different journals, number of papers per year, and type of disaster. We have also categorized the papers based on their decision variables into three categories: Allocation papers (“A”), Location papers (“L”), and Location-Allocation papers (“LA”). After that, we have assessed our current literature based on some of the methodological issues in Humanitarian Operations that gathered by Kovacs and Moshtari (2018). The second aim of our paper is research gap identification. Our key findings in this domain are that there is a lack of papers that: consider demand-side costs in their proposed model objectives; deal with uncertainty in funding, budget, asset and supply quantities, and infrastructure; considering prepositioning as a risk mitigation strategy; take reliability into account for reducing the risk of loss; consider prepositioning of medical staff and emergency crew; discuss the best time to start prepositioning of supplies and assets in confronting a foreseen disaster; use social media to better prepare for upcoming disasters.}

The trade values can generally reflect periodical (annual or monthly) flows of cargo types and values between two economies, while the geographical and transportation details cannot be embodied although they are important for national logistics and supply chains. We investigate the vessel flows between two national maritime networks activated by possible implications to trade and shipping investments. The maritime network of flows between China and Vietnam is figured as a typical example under the consideration that the two countries are both typical maritime countries and the development of China is slowing down while Vietnam's economy and trade are booming. Using five years' mutual connectivity data between Vietnam and China, the flow directions and amounts are estimated and examined by network and flow analyzing methods. Maritime convection is introduced to investigate the changing cargo flows that represents supply chains between the two countries. Maritime fluctuation is used to study the strength and tendencies of seaborne trade between the two countries. These two aspects are visualized and conceptualized in the context of China's Belt and Road Initiative. New maritime interconnection facilities and opportunities are then discussed based on the results from this analysis. All methods for developing the networks and metrics of convection and fluctuation are incorporated into a system framework. So, the proposed method can be used for general network relation analysis, especially when the networks are connected by flows.}

Each outbound shipment for a dispatch involves cargos that incur a stepwise transportation cost. To increase the effect of shipment consolidation, the distribution center allows backlogging. This problem has the characteristics of capacitated and uncapacitated lot-sizing. A forward dynamic program is applied to exploit the beneficial characteristic of the uncapacitated problem. The forward dynamic program is implemented using Zangwill partitions to decrease the number of computational parameters with legitimacy checks to guarantee optimality. Employing these techniques, we provide an O(T4) algorithm, which serves as an improvement on the O(T6) algorithm of previous research. Moreover, computational results from actual implementations show that our algorithm is significantly faster than that of prior research.}

The characteristics of four major stakeholders (i.e., the government, URFT operator, market, and road freight sector) as well as a series of variables affecting system operations, such as metrics of social and environmental externalities, pricing, investment, and subsidies, were incorporated into two submodels. A case study of Beijing, China was provided to demonstrate the historical validity and rationality of simulation results from 2007 to 2035. Three decision variables (i.e., investment policy, network scale and market competitiveness) were combined into eight distinct scenarios to examine the external benefits, pricing strategies, capital funding structure and business volume of URFT. The findings show that URFT schemes with higher funding and capacity lead to greater reductions in the losses of traffic congestion, air pollution, and accidents. Furthermore, both government support in the early stage and regulation mechanisms among price, supply–demand level, and investment play significant roles in improving the system performance.}

abstract = {The complexity of today's e-commerce logistics environment compels practitioners to achieve a higher level of operating efficiency. As it is infeasible for operators to process a large number of discrete e-orders individually, warehouse postponement, that is, delaying the execution of a logistics process until the last possible moment, is essential. Yet the question remains as to how one can accurately identify the timing for consolidating e-orders, and subsequently releasing the grouped e-orders for batch order picking. This is a subject, lacking previous research, but is fundamentally crucial in today's e-commerce logistics environment. This paper introduces an integrated autoregressive-adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (AR-ANFIS) approach for forecasting e-commerce order arrivals. Two AR-ANFIS models are built for evaluating their prediction ability against ARIMA models. The experimental results confirm the suitability of the hybrid model for forecasting e-order arrivals. To make use of the model output, an algorithm is formulated to convert e-order arrival figures into cut-off time of order grouping. In this sense, this total solution, packaged as a decision support system, namely the E-order arrival prediction system, assists logistics practitioners in judging when to release the grouped e-orders for batch processing, and essentially improves their order handling capability.}

The study takes place in the downtown part of the city, which depends on a wide range of companies to provide employment, products and services for a large part of the city’s population, along with neighboring cities. As a historical heritage city, the traditional city streets reflect planning from a long time ago, during a time in which modern transportation vehicles and services were practically nonexistent. These factors make commerce in the downtown region a particular challenge for the urban organism. To better understand this scenario and indicate measurements to improve the functioning of the urban transportation network, 152 companies responded to interview questions about the main implicit variables in their goods receiving processes, along with information regarding cargo and vehicle types, trips and infrastructure. Any measure taken to mitigate these problems must obligatorily consider the historic nature of the city and establish coherence between the conflicting objectives of the diverse actors which make up the urban environment. The results show the need for creation of new policies for urban logistics, including more areas reserved for loading and unloading of cargo, along with greater monitoring these areas from authorities to guarantee that the law is upheld. Emission reductions are achieved using freight demand management such as off-hour deliveries and investing in technology to reduce emissions from delivery trucks.}
