abstract = {Life and property losses along environmental pollution caused by accidents in the transportation of hazardous goods have raised serious concerns over the efficient handling of hazardous cargo vessels in a port environment. Very few studies have explicitly aimed the dynamic risk associated with hazardous cargos in a ship berthing scenario. Corresponding to these concerns, this study is aimed to assess the risks concomitant to the berthing of hazardous cargo vessels. The methodology adopted for this study is the combination of binary logistics regression & expert judgment for the identification of various influencing factors, and the Bayesian networks environment for the inference and analysis of these factors. The results indicate that under normal conditions the hazardous cargo vessel risk has a comparatively lower probability of 3.97, but its risk score indicates that it cannot be ignored and requires attention to be solved. Setting evidence at hazardous cargo accident, human and environment proves to be the most significant contributors. Environmental factor is the most prominent factor, which at its full effect, raises the accident probability to 14.91 with a risk score of 9.17 which is a highly dangerous class II risk requiring immediate solution. This study indicates that training along the mental & psychological state of ship crew, wind force, water velocity, channel width, berth layout and port location are the significant factors that the authorities need to focus on for invulnerable berthing of a hazardous cargo vessel. This study has prominent practical viability for conducting risk management and planning for hazardous cargo vessels.}

abstract = {Multi-vehicle routing problem with soft time windows (MVRPSTW) is an indispensable constituent in urban logistics distribution systems. Over the past decade, numerous methods for MVRPSTW have been proposed, but most are based on heuristic rules that require a large amount of computation time. With the current rapid increase of logistics demands, traditional methods incur the dilemma between computational efficiency and solution quality. To efficiently solve the problem, we propose a novel reinforcement learning algorithm called the Multi-Agent Attention Model that can solve routing problem instantly benefit from lengthy offline training. Specifically, the vehicle routing problem is regarded as a vehicle tour generation process, and an encoder-decoder framework with attention layers is proposed to generate tours of multiple vehicles iteratively. Furthermore, a multi-agent reinforcement learning method with an unsupervised auxiliary network is developed for the model training. By evaluated on four synthetic networks with different scales, the results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms Google OR-Tools and traditional methods with little computation time. In addition, we validate the robustness of the well-trained model by varying the number of customers and the capacities of vehicles.}

This paper moves forward to contribute to the second stage for offensive by assessing the energy and environmental impacts related to vaccination. The vaccination campaign is a multidisciplinary topic incorporating policies, population behaviour, planning, manufacturing, materials supporting, cold-chain logistics and waste treatment. The vaccination for pandemic control in the current phase is prioritised over other decisions, including energy and environmental issues. This study documents that vaccination should be implemented in maximum sustainable ways. The energy and related emissions of a single vaccination are not massive; however, the vast numbers related to the worldwide production, logistics, disinfection, implementation and waste treatment are reaching significant figures. The preliminary assessment indicates that the energy is at the scale of ~1.08 × 1010 kWh and related emissions of ~5.13 × 1012 gCO2eq when embedding for the envisaged 1.56 × 1010 vaccine doses. The cold supply chain is estimated to constitute 69.8% of energy consumption of the vaccination life cycle, with an interval of 26–99% depending on haul distance. A sustainable supply chain model that responds to an emergency arrangement, considering equality as well, should be emphasised to mitigate vaccination's environmental footprint. This effort plays a critical role in preparing for future pandemics, both environmentally and socially. Research in exploring sustainable single-use or reusable materials is also suggested to be a part of the plans. Diversified options could offer higher flexibility in mitigating environmental footprint even during the emergency and minimise the potential impact of material disruption or dependency.}

A network of dry ports also can reduce the amount of pollution emitted from logistics activities by allowing the increasing share of environmentally friendly modes of transport. The paper suggests a green routing model for dry port selection to increases the percentage of using rail or inland waterway transportation in the journey through dry port, instead of road transportation. This model reduces the amount of emission from logistics activities, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), nitric oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM) with the minimum cost, considering both the emission charge and the shipping charge. A case study is conducted for Samsung Thai Nguyen factory in the North of Vietnam to validate the model application. The results indicate that the smallest total cost route saves up to 51% of CO2 and 36.5% of PM emission exhausted than unimodal road transportation. The research provides a useful guideline for new green transport policies of public agents as well as decision-making processes in private companies.}

The purpose of this paper is to document a baseline cost and risk assessment from the perspective of biorefinery management for two herbaceous feedstocks, switchgrass and corn stover, in an application of Integrated Landscape Design (ILD). Integrating energy crops into row crops has attracted considerable attention leading to a variety of ways to implement ILD. However, variation in production conditions, different methods of implementing unit operations, and technology performance variability are among many factors leading to financial risk facing biorefineries from feedstock supply based on ILD. Utilizing data from field-based trials on switchgrass and corn stover in Virginia and Iowa in the United States, we estimate feedstock logistics cost and characterize it by a distribution of potential outcomes. The results show that, across fields included in the study, logistics cost for switchgrass vary from $73 per Mg to $171 per Mg. For corn stover, the inter-field variation in cost ranges from $83 per Mg to $105 per Mg. Results for intra-field uncertainty show that the cost for switchgrass ranges from $58 per Mg to $74 per Mg, and for corn stover they range from $50 per Mg to $65 per Mg. These results inform a baseline from which improvements in ILD can be compared, and provide biorefinery management with a starting point for cost and risk estimates of feedstock from ILD.}

One of their main tasks is to facilitate the domestic and international trade of goods. The paper attempts to highlight the major role that ports have in the transport system together with the minimization of the transport costs. Ports provide a crucial interface between land and sea. Ports, as integrated logistics centers and multifunctional socio-economic spaces, are key components of the European and global transport system. They also cover transport, logistics, distribution and space functions that influence the city development. Port improvement plays a major role in reducing the transport costs. In order to reduce transport costs, we need to identify the necessary changes to the system (additional berths, reducing the service time by upgrading the operating facilities etc.) to reduce the penalties. Most often, in order to minimize costs, the economic function (sum of waiting costs) have to be optimized. A useful tool for approaching port optimization problems is provided by the theory of queuing: ships can be regarded as "customers", while the "service stations" can be represented by the berths of a seaport. In the case of transit storage, the transfer of goods between sea and land transport is not a single-stage process. In these circumstances the optimum number of berths should be replaced by the optimum number of cranes and the optimum area for transit storage. However, in the hypothetical case study from the paper we will consider the case of a single-stage and single-channel facility (one berth) in order to reduce the queuing time. The main conclusion from the analysis is that the expected queuing time may be reduced either by increasing the handling speed or by making ships more homogeneous (by specializing in serving a particular type of ship or cargo).}

abstract = {Electric freight vehicles have strong potential to reduce emissions stemming from logistics operations; however, their limited range still causes critical limitations. Range anxiety is directly related to the total amount of energy consumed during trips. There are several operational factors that affect the energy consumption of electric vehicles and should be considered for accurate route planning. Among them, ambient temperature arises as a key factor because cabin heating or cooling may significantly increase the energy discharged from the battery during the trip and reduce the driving range. Additionally, cold temperatures decrease the battery efficiency and cause performance losses. In this study, we investigate the effect of ambient temperature on the fleet composition, energy consumption, and routing decisions in last-mile delivery operations. First, we present the mathematical programming formulation of the problem. Next, we perform an extensive computational study based on benchmark data from the literature. For solving the small-size instances we use a commercial solver. For solving the large-size instances we employ an adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm. Our results show that the route plans made without considering the ambient temperature effect may lead to inefficient operations and disruptions. Specifically, the fleet size and energy consumption can increase by 46% and 81%, respectively, in small-size problems on average due to ambient temperature whereas the average increase can reach 15% and 68%, respectively, in large-size problems. Finally, we present a case study from a logistics company operating in Southern Turkey to provide managerial insights to both researchers and practitioners.}

We also need to approach these challenges through a lens unique to cell therapy, rather than constraining future innovation on historical success in tangential fields. Should we aim to directly mimic the elegant hierarchies of expansion and differentiation in the body? Can we decouple stem cell expansion and differentiation to rewire native systems and achieve other manufacturing constraints? Can we let the body take over some of the manufacturing burden?

Here we report the preclinical evaluation of a novel COVID-19 vaccine candidate based on the electroporation of engineered, synthetic cDNA encoding a viral antigen in the skeletal muscle. We constructed a set of prototype DNA vaccines expressing various forms of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein and assessed their immunogenicity in animal models.

Upon challenge with SARS-CoV-2, immunized K18-hACE2 transgenic mice showed reduced weight loss, improved pulmonary function, and lower viral replication in the lungs and brain. COVID-eVax conferred significant protection to ferrets upon SARS-CoV-2 challenge.

abstract = {The construction sector has suffered from low productivity and considerable wastes due to the fragmentation of its value chain, the large number of diverse stakeholders and the complex nature of the projects. A promising way to reduce construction wastes and encourage value chain integration is to implement circular economy (CE) strategies. Many recent studies in the fields of construction management and sustainability have advanced CE from multiple perspectives. There remains room to refine such knowledge by clearly identifying all the possible strategies and drivers to be carried out in practice that help stakeholders slow, narrow, and close resource loops. This study aims to conduct a systematic review to examine the relevant literature on construction circularity to address the knowledge gap. A total of 61 relevant publications in the past ten years were rigorously selected and reviewed in-depth based on an iterative coding procedure. The phase-specific circular economy strategies were classified into five categories: 1) Design phase (including design with LCA, design with reused materials, design with recycled materials, and design for disassembly); 2) Manufacturing phase (including industrial symbiosis); 3) Construction phase (including lean construction methods); 4) Operation and maintenance phase (including service life planning); and 5) End-of-Life phase (including diversion of wastes). Internal drivers were identified to consist of BIM-based design and evaluation, IoT (Internet of Things)-based material tracking, predictive data analytics, and logistics network optimization. External drivers included material certifications and legislation, financial incentives, market maturity and material flow balance, and social engagement. The review revealed that the BIM-based and LCA-based methods have been widely used; however, logistics network optimization to allow industrial symbiosis was not adequately addressed in the existing literature. The strategies and drivers were also composed into a framework that aims to guide the future implementation of circular construction projects.

This paper illustrates the needs and requirements for managing supply chains in multi-company project environments by adopting various tracking and tracing technologies. This kind of tracking and tracing is especially needed within distributed architectures engaged in project-based businesses, where several vendors are involved in a single project. Such tracking and tracing data can be used extensively to generate key performance indicators, which can be used to measure and control supply chain processes. This paper also proposes a pilot system of a cloud-based portal for real-time tracking and tracing of logistics and supply chains. This portal is formed by the combination of RFID, IoT and blockchain technology into an integrated real-time view. RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) and IoT (Internet of Things) provides real-time information or data, while blockchain technology is used to provide a chain of immutable transactions. The architecture of the proposed portal system is connected to transport companies, tracking devices, consolidation points and suppliers. The pilot study also illustrates the benefits and advantages of such a portal system.}

Several studies have argued that maximising demand coverage, reducing logistics costs and minimising response time are among the critical objectives when locating RDCs after a sudden-onset disaster. However, these objectives are often conflicting and the trade-offs can considerably complicate the situation for finding a consensus. To address the challenge and support the DMs, we suggest investigating the stability of non-dominated alternatives derived from a multi-objective model based on Monte Carlo Simulations. Our approach supports determining what trade-offs actually matter to facilitate discussions in the presence of multiple stakeholders. To validate our proposal, we extend a location-allocation model and apply our approach to an actual data-set from the 2015 Nepal earthquake response. Our analyses show that with the relative importance of covering demands ≤0.4, the trade-offs between logistics costs and response time affects the numbers and locations of RDCs considerably. We show through a small experiment that the outputs of our approach can effectively support group decision-making to develop relief plans in disasters response.}

abstract = {Background
Personal disclosure of opioid use disorder (OUD) recovery can lead to relationship outcomes such as social support, which is associated with greater treatment retention, or stigma, which is associated with risk of treatment dropout. Although disclosure may have important impacts on the relationships and ensuing recovery trajectories of people with OUD, disclosure processes remain understudied in the context of OUD.
Methods
Guided by the Disclosure Process Model, this longitudinal study explored the disclosure goals of people in treatment for OUD and examined associations between disclosure goals and relationship outcomes. Data were collected at baseline (N = 146) and three months later (n = 124) from participants who were in treatment for OUD and planning to disclose their OUD history and/or treatment to someone new.
Results
Qualitative baseline data were analyzed to identify disclosure goals. Approach goals (i.e., reasons for disclosure) included support, honesty, amends, set an example, and logistics; avoidance goals (i.e., reasons against disclosure) included judgment, worry, and privacy. Quantitative data suggested that approach goals at baseline were associated with greater likelihood of disclosure within three months (OR=2.16, 95% CI=1.04–4.49) as well as with greater social support [B(SE)= 0.35(0.16), p = 0.03] and relationship closeness [B(SE)= 0.29(0.17), p = 0.01] following disclosures. In contrast, avoidance goals at baseline were associated with greater enacted stigma following disclosures [B(SE)= 0.30(0.14), p = 0.04].
Conclusions
Findings draw attention to the potentially important role of disclosures in relationship outcomes among people in recovery from OUD. Disclosure may represent a promising intervention target to improve relationship outcomes and recovery trajectories of people in recovery from OUD.}

abstract = {Background
Analyzing potential benefits of thermostable vaccines delivered through Micro Array Patch (MAP) has received great attention in low and middle-income countries. The experience may or may not be the same in developed countries where the infrastructure is more developed. It is anticipated that transforming the vaccine supply chain from syringe-and-needle to thermostable MAP-delivered vaccines will result in reduced supply chain costs – including manufacturing/supply, logistics/distribution, and administration costs – as well as reduced wastes and improved safety. This paper provides an end-to-end supply chain analysis comparing the key aspects (cost, safety and environmental aspects) of the conventional syringe-and-needle vaccine supply chain with those of the MAP vaccine supply chain for influenza vaccine delivery in Australia. Directions for future research in this area will be provided.
Objective
To determine the potential supply chain impacts of replacing syringe-and-needle flu vaccine with MAP-enabled thermostable flu vaccine in Australia.
Methods
We analyze the current flu vaccine supply chain in Australia to identify practical limitations and opportunities for improvement. Data/information is collected through interviewing the key stakeholders across vaccine supply chain including vaccine manufacturers, logistics providers, clinics, hospitals, and pharmacies.
Findings
A detailed practice-informed analysis is completed on the key operations of the flu vaccine supply chain. Barriers and limitations of the conventional flu vaccine are discussed, along with potential improvements that can be achieved through the implementation of MAP-enabled flu vaccine delivery. We discuss how technology-driven innovations can help advance vaccine supply chains, improve vaccine visibility, reduce wastes, and enable informed decision-making.
Conclusion
We find that the benefits of moving from syringe-and-needle vaccines to thermostable MAP-delivered vaccines are beyond transportation and storage cost saving. Potential benefits through cost saving, waste reduction, and service level improvement are discussed along with various safety and wellbeing consequences followed by directions for future research in this area.}

The problem is formulated as a mixed integer programming model (MILP). Then, a simulation-optimization (SO) approach is proposed to provide robust solutions which remain feasible in spite of perturbations. The proposed approach uses a Modified Threshold Accepting meta-heuristic (MTA) as an optimizer combined with an embedded perturbation simulator to ensure the robustness of the solutions.

Researchers and sector stakeholders increasingly realize that this container market segment has its distinct dynamics and demands. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the reefer container sector, its most important characteristics and trends, and a systematic review of the academic literature on reefer containers and logistics. First the authors outline the characteristics, composition, and development of the reefer container market, showing its growth through modal shift (from conventional reefer ships and airfreight) and differentiation into new cargo markets and niche services. Secondly the authors outline reefer chains in terms of their relevant stages, stakeholders, and processes. Data on insurance claims shows that cold chain failure and cargo loss not only occur due to technical failures, but just as often due to organizational errors – especially due to hold-up risk at container transfer points. Thirdly the authors map the present knowledge on reefer containers and reefer transportation through a systematic literature review. The current body of research on reefer containers consists mostly of highly specialized, technical studies on product characteristics and quality preservation, monitoring and control, refrigeration technology, and temperature management. While technological advances in these fields have largely enabled the containerization of cold logistics chains, the first sections of this paper also highlight that many current pressing issues in reefer transportation are logistical and organizational in nature. Therefore, the authors propose a research agenda addressing these overlooked aspects, including supply chain coordination issues and implications of reefer market developments for port policy.}

The compounding complexity of the multiple objectives and dynamic problem constraints required to represent coordinated solid waste management (CSWM) problem in practice is a hugely significant issue for vehicle routing problem studies. The purpose is to introduce a new coordinated framework for a practical and efficient vehicle routing problem considering the triple bottom line of sustainability. The CSWM multiple objective functions applied in this study incorporate financial, environmental and social considerations to develop a sustainable vehicle routing problem considering heterogeneous vehicle fleets operating across a multi-echelon logistics network with the optimization goals. An entirely novel development and application of the adaptive memory social engineering optimizer (AMSEO) is introduced and is shown to perform significantly better than the simulated annealing (SA) as well as the social engineering optimizer (SEO) itself. Finally, the potential overall waste disposal cost savings achievable through increased recycling (revealed by framing the logistics problem across several echelons) is of particular significance. The main findings are the practical solutions with the use of sustainability goals for the CSWM and further application and development of the AMSEO in the routing optimization.}

To assess the risk of lateral ankle sprain (LAS) in male and female tactical athletes across different military occupations in the US military.
Design
Retrospective cohort.
Methods
The Defense Medical Epidemiology Database was queried for the number of individuals with ICD-9 diagnosis codes 845.00 (sprain of ankle, unspecified) and 845.02 (calcaneofibular ligament sprain) on their initial encounter from 2006 to 2015. Relative risk (RR) and chi-square statistics were calculated assessing sex and occupational category on LAS risk.
Results
272,970 enlisted males (27.9 per 1000 person-years), 56,732 enlisted females (34.5 per 1000 person-years), 24,534 male officers (12.6 per 1000 person-years), and 6020 female officers (16.4 per 1000 person-years) incurred a LAS. Enlisted females in all occupational groups were at significantly higher risk for LAS than their male counterparts (RR 1.09–1.68; p<0.001), except for Engineers (p=0.15). Female officers had consistently higher risk for LAS in all occupational groups (RR 1.10–1.42; p<0.001) compared with male officers, except Ground/Naval Gunfire (p=0.23). Contrasted with Infantry, enlisted tactical athletes in the Special Operations Forces, Mechanized/Armor, Aviation, Maintenance, and Maritime/Naval Specialties were at lower risk (RR 0.38−0.93; p<0.001), Artillery, Engineers, and Logistics Specialties were at higher risk (RR 1.04–1.18; p<0.001), and Administration, Intelligence, and Communications were no different (p=0.69). Compared with Ground/Naval Gunfire officers, Aviation officers were at significantly lower risk (RR, 0.75; p<0.001), and Engineers, Maintenance, Administration, Operations/Intelligence, and Logistics officers were at higher risk (RR, 1.08–1.20; p<0.001).

Legacy for Children™ ( Legacy ) is a groupbased prevention program designed to promote child development by reinforcing sensitive, responsive mother-child relationships, building maternal self-efficacy, and fostering peer networks of support among mothers living in poverty (Perou et al., 2012). The Legacy program was translated and culturally adapted for Spanishspeaking Latina mothers and their infants with a feasibility trial conducted to determine the cultural congruency of the adaptation. Feasibility results were positive with no previous studies validating the adapted Legacy Spanish program. The current manuscript focuses on understanding factors of engagement of the culturally adapted model. Specifically, we examined the factors that were perceived to have enhanced or hindered both initial and sustained engagement in the adapted Legacy Spanish program for Latina mothers. Individual interviews were conducted with Latina mothers (N=26) who attended the Legacy Spanish program. We used qualitative data analysis to identify broad themes in Latina mothers’ responses. Themes emerged regarding the importance of using home-based recruitment strategies and pairing verbal information with written brochures to foster initial engagement. Sustained engagement themes focused on the provision of support from other Latina mothers in the Legacy group and the relationships with the group leaders. Having group leaders who were perceived as genuine, kind, positive, “good” at teaching, and persistent emerged as themes that facilitated initial and ongoing engagement. Barriers to engagement centered primarily on logistics rather than characteristics of the program itself. Thus, Latina mothers attributed importance to aspects of the curriculum, logistics, and implementation with respect to program engagement. Application of similar engagement strategies could enhance the success of early childhood parenting programs and linkages with early educational programming.}

In this paper, we develop a multi-echelon and multi-item integrated production-transportation closed loop supply chain model. The model includes raw material suppliers, hybrid facilities, customers, collection centres, and disposal centres. Three objective functions under consideration are the minimization of total cost, total defected items and total delivery time. To deal with real life uncertainties we adopted the reliability approach for cost parameters whereas supply and demand parameters are considered as uncertain variables. Cost reliability parameters, as well as uncertain constraints are converted into their crisp equivalent form using necessary approaches. Fuzzy goal programming is used to obtain a compromise solution to the proposed model. The proposed model is tested on a real-life case study and finally, the results and conclusions are discussed. This paper provides acumen for fomenting the decision making process in logistics problems.}

The problem deals with the logistic network design and material flow management to supply the multi-product and multi-period customer demand. Decisions on production site use, including lot-sizing, setup and minimum batches are taken from a cost saving perspective together with warehouse management decisions, including shipments to external warehouses. We present a mathematical formulation of the problem that is based on a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model and takes into account all the nasty constraints that are present in the real problem. We show that such a model is computationally hard even using a state-of-the-art commercial solver, and introduce a metaheuristic algorithm that we use to compute approximate solutions. We test the proposed algorithms on two real-world test-cases and on a large set of realistic problems. The results show that, in all cases, the algorithm is very fast and produces solutions whose quality is very close to those that can be obtained by running a state-of-the-art commercial solver on the mathematical model for a very long time, thus providing for an efficient method for evaluating effective policies to be used under different scenarios. The models and the solving algorithms are of help to the industrial practitioners for the mid-term tactical management of their logistic networks.}

Method
A modified Delphi method was used to generate consensus around specific elements synonymous with high quality and relevant interprofessional education resources and instructional materials. The process included one pre-voting round with a convenience sample of 15 IPE professionals, and 3 subsequent rounds with an 8 member IPE expert panel from 6 institutions.
Results
The resulting IPE checklist includes 33 items grouped into categories of Content, Logistics and Assessment considerations. The checklist supports the development of new resources and evaluation of existing activities.

abstract = {Objectives
Limited research and guidance on the use of “withdrawal” or coitus interruptus for contraception lead to inconsistent or even inaccurate physician recommendations regarding its use. Consequently, patients rely on online communities to learn about this commonly used contraceptive method. To identify knowledge gaps and concerns between men and women, as well as explore how they use withdrawal, we examined withdrawal-related posts on the popular internet discussion forum, Reddit.
Study design
To explore gendered variations in withdrawal-related Reddit posts, we extracted posts from the gendered forums: “TwoXChromosomes,” “Askwomen,” “Askmen,” and “OneY” between 2010 and 2019 that contained the search terms: “coitus interruptus,” “withdrawal,” “pull out,” “preejaculate,” or “precum.” We developed an initial codebook with expected codes and augmented it with emerging findings from a random sampling of 10% of posts. We revised iteratively for interrater agreement, after which researchers coded the remaining posts independently.
Results
Of 269 withdrawal-related queries, 19% were submitted by men; 81% referenced the contributor's own withdrawal use. Salient domains included: concerns about pregnancy risk (59%), how to effectively use withdrawal (13%), benefits/pleasure from using withdrawal (12%), impact on personal life/relationship (9%), and problems encountered, inclusive of consent (7%). Posts to female-focused forums more frequently inquired about pregnancy risk, while those on male forums more frequently inquired about withdrawal-related logistics (p < 0.001); domains were not associated with contributor gender.
Conclusion
Withdrawal-related queries within this Reddit sample are frequently posted by women, the majority of whom want to understand their risk of pregnancy with withdrawal. Research operationalizing withdrawal and more accurately estimating withdrawal-related pregnancy risk is warranted.
Implications
Reddit users discuss their personal experiences with withdrawal as contraception, as well as seek advice regarding its use from the online community. Pregnancy risk, logistics of use, and ongoing stigma are salient topics. Further research on pregnancy risk, operationalizing success, and approaches for discussing this behavioral method is warranted.}

The concept of applying real-time location sensing (RTLS) technology has already been introduced in commercial construction applications. These report in a business process the position of valuable construction resources such as equipment, materials, and lately also personnel. While several other communication protocols exist (e.g., GMS, BLE, RFID), unfortunately little is known about the performance and applications of Long Range (LoRa), wireless data communication technology for very-long-range transmissions up to several kilometers at low power consumption. This paper first introduces the need for such technology and then explains the integration of LoRa in an Internet of Things (IoT) network, which enables to connect, collect, and exchange data for construction applications. A case study evaluates Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) in realistic and human-centric construction work environments, i.e., error, reliability, and other practical benefits. The experiences made with the developed LoRa-technology are in particular useful for demonstrating its applicability in construction logistics and lean management services.}

abstract = {Background
Implementation science is essential for identifying the strengths and challenges of evidence-based interventions when they are delivered in community settings. We examined the implementation of Facing Your Fears (FYF), a cognitive behaviour group intervention for autistic children and youth who experience co-occurring anxiety, in a hospital setting versus a community setting.
Method
This qualitative study was based on theories of diffusion of innovation and mutual adaptation and explored the implementation process through the perceptions of facilitators and managers. Sixteen multi-disciplinary facilitators and managers were interviewed regarding their perceptions of the compatibility, complexity, relative advantages, barriers, challenges, and adaptations that arose during implementation of FYF.
Results
Overall, facilitators and managers from both organizations reported that FYF had good compatibility with their organization, implementation of FYF was not too complex, and members of each organization reported advantages that were directly related to their setting. Facilitators and managers reported barriers and challenges that were organized into four theme-categories: system-level, intervention delivery, logistics, and individual and family. Adaptation themes aligned with the barriers and challenges that each organization encountered when implementing FYF, and modifications were made to both the intervention and the organization structure to overcome implementation challenges.
Conclusion
This is the first study to examine implementation of FYF in two different settings, providing essential knowledge on the versatility and sustainability of this program in multiple healthcare settings. Facilitators and managers identified specific characteristics, barriers, and adaptations for FYF that can provide insight for organizations considering FYF implementation.}

The Blockchain is an open ledger that provides decentralization, transparency, immutability, and confidentiality. Blockchain can be used in massive, beneficial applications such as healthcare, logistics, supply chain management, the Internet of Things (IoT), etc. Most of the industrial applications rely on the permissioned Blockchain. However, the permissioned Blockchain fails in some aspects, such as scalability and throughput. This paper suggests a system to solve the scalability issue of permissioned Blockchain by incorporating data science techniques. The scalability analysis of the proposed solution is done in the hyperledger fabric framework with a variable number of transactions and results in scalability improvement.}

The development of the Digital Twins of Exoskeleton-centered workplaces faces the challenge of approaching the manual assembly and logistics processes as performed by hybrid resources: workers wearing Exoskeletons. From here, the coupling of an Exoskeleton to the digital worker and the realization of the Exoskeleton-Worker Digital Twin requires a thorough understanding of the human models and of wearable robotics, especially Exoskeleton design principles. A coupling methodology was developed and the prototype of the Digital Twins coupled with a commercial Exoskeleton was validated in automotive and logistics industries. The paper presents the performed research for: a) the optimization of the coupling process; b) the modification of the simulation parameters; and c) the embedding of the active Exoskeleton controller to a production and ergonomic simulation software.}

abstract = {One of the strategic objectives of supply chains in the automotive industry is the development of international sourcing. Renault works with a global network of cross-docking platforms to link distant assembly plants with first-tier suppliers. These platforms act both as information and physical consolidation points. At shop-floor, inland deliveries are received, sorted, repacked (if needed) and loaded onto containers for overseas transportation. Distribution and operation planning are key activities in such a cross-dock platform but despite its interdependency, current research considers them separately. This paper presents a detailed analysis of Renault cross-dock platforms called ILN (International Logistics Networks), their planning process and physical flows. An integer linear programming model to plan jointly the distribution and shop-floor operations in a cross-dock platform of Renault is developed. The objective is to minimize total cost composed of transportation cost (inbound and outbound), cost of internal resources and storage cost. Numerical offline tests of the model with CPLEX, based on real data for a number of past periods, have showed a 13% reduction of total cost. These encouraging tests confirm both the ability of the proposed approach to deal with real-size instances and the potential gains which can be obtained by considering decision related to distribution and planning together. Taking into account these results, the part of model concerning inbound logistics was integrated in the planning system used in a Renault ILN. The results of the first exploitation period have shown a reduction of 20% of inbound transportation cost comparing with the previous period without increasing the other costs.}

Its main purpose is to assess the resilience level of the agri-food sector to the coronavirus pandemic, analyzing its effect on commodity prices and focusing on the supply and value chain. The results highlight that fresh and perishable products, whose production or harvest took place during the first wave of COVID-19, have suffered price level effects, while storable products have not registered significant impacts. This phenomenon is mainly due to the vulnerability of the harvest and production phases, which affected fresh and perishable products supply, and to the resilience of transports and logistics, which instead ensured the supply of storable products to the final consumer. Especially in case of future pandemic waves, the implications and information deriving from the present analysis could support researchers, policy makers and managers, serving as an assessment tool to build suitable strategies for the whole agri-food supply chain and thus ensure sector resilience during these unprecedented times.}

Therefore, this research aimed to identify opportunities for creating value by internalizing flows in the production of silk cocoons by promoting a circular bioeconomy. To that end, a tool was used to assess the circularity of the referred system. The current circularity of the production of silk cocoons, at the farm level, is 74.19 % for material, and 0 % for energy. A range of measures are proposed, based on (i) engaging with reverse logistics practices, (ii) establishing a local agroindustrial cooperative, and (iii) building community biodigesters, which aid a potential circularity of 85.51 % (material), and 100 % (energy) at the farm level, and 98.42 % (material) and 100 % (energy), at the cooperative level. On top of increasing circular value, the proposed measures might bring environmental benefits, such as lessening environmental impacts of logistics (by valuing local resources) and replacing non-renewable energy, and social impacts, through increased quality of life for sericulturists. Economic implications need further investigation and are suggested to be addressed in future research endeavors, along with policy implications for the development of a circular bioeconomy. Furthermore, an increased circularity can also contribute to a few of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) proposed by the United Nations, such as SDGs 2, 7, 9, 11, 12 and 13.}

In this paper, we apply the technology management method called “technology assessment" to the processes of electrical filling and formation of pouch cells to identify and evaluate possible digitalization measures. As a result, the digitalization measures in the process technology, logistics, quality control and energy system of the two processes are discussed and evaluated according to their potential and technology readiness level. The combination of digital twins of the battery cell with the digital factory operation is assessed as the most promising measure.}

abstract = {Data quantity generated in supply chains expands as supply chain processes get more complex. Companies can leverage such data and gain valuable insight into their processes with Supply Chain Analytics (SCA) tools. The selection of the most appropriate SCA tool directly affects companies’ productivity since they allow enhancing visibility, obtaining informed decision-making and developing well-planned strategies for companies. A simple, practical, efficient and robust decision-making method can help select the most suitable SCA tool. Such a selection problem can be solved with multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods that consider different criteria. This paper proposes an SCA tool evaluation model which combines hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set (HFLTS), analytic hierarchy process (AHP), multi-objective optimization by ratio analysis, and the full multiplicative (MULTIMOORA). The HFLTS technique is applied for handling the uncertainty and hesitancy of experts’ views in the evaluation process. The weights of the six main selection criteria and their thirty sub-criteria are computed via the hesitant fuzzy linguistic (HFL) AHP method. Then, the HFL MULTIMOORA method is combined with the fuzzy envelope technique for the first time in the literature to rank the eight SCA tool alternatives from different companies. A case study for a logistics firm illustrates the potential of the proposed evaluation model, which underlines the most important criteria to be the statistical power, product quality improvement, organizational performance enhancement, and service cooperation. It also ranks PeopleSoft as the most appropriate SCA tool for the case company. A comparative analysis with the HFL VIKOR method demonstrated that the proposed method is robust and consistent.}

In this work, a fuzzy-based multi-objective approach is developed for planning sustainable new expansions of agriculture lands. Also, the expansion and capacity of post-harvest and production facilities and operations of logistics in the agro-industrial value chain are optimised. The model is a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) which takes profit, carbon footprint, and water footprint into account during optimisation. The expansion plan is optimised based on the expected increase in the demand for a particular agro-industrial product. To illustrate the proposed model, a palm value chain case study is solved. A scenario with a projected increase in palm oil demand is considered to demonstrate the model. The results for the case study showed a distinctive difference in the expansion strategy compared to single-objective optimisation, exhibiting trade-off between profit and carbon, water footprints.}

It takes into account different refrigeration applications (i.e. for different warehouse dock temperatures), exterior conditions and daily loading/unloading schedules and their duration. We have used mean typical years for the different Spanish climatic zones, although the procedure can be easily extended to any climate. As expected, the greatest energy savings are achieved in the warmest climates with the coldest storage temperatures and for the nocturnal operations. The savings quantification allowed us to convince the owner to replace the conventional dock shelters. Finally, the implementation of the procedure in a software-tool is helping other dealers to carry out a self-evaluation of the savings potential of their facilities.}

In our architecture concept the process logistics and the production control entities interact with the Cyber-Physical Logistics Centre which is the main interface connected to CPTM. Within this architecture it is possible to integrate AGVs vendor-independent and holistic. After the introduction of the modular, vendor-independent production, the state of the art regarding AGV with a focus on their information models and IT-Systems is given. We develop a concept for the integration of CPTM into existing modular production environments (brownfield) including physical, human and information interfaces. In an outlook, we aim to implement this concept into a real-life production and environment consisting of vendor-independent cyber-physical production modules (CPPM). Future work should focus on developing the structure and information model of the interface. Therefore, one key technology in the field of Industrie 4.0 is the Asset Administration Shell.}

Embryo quality is crucial for determining the outcome of embryo implantation. This study aimed to assess the impact of embryo quality on the outcome of in vitro fertilization/single-embryo transfer (IVF-SET).
Materials and methods
This retrospective study included 2531 fresh IVF-SET cycles, including 277 poor-quality and 2254 top-quality embryos. The clinical pregnancy rate, miscarriage rate, live birth, implantation rate, pregnancy outcome and complication were analyzed and compared. Risk factors associated with miscarriage rate and pregnancy complication were identified using logistics regression analysis.
Results
Top-quality embryos resulted in higher clinical pregnancy rate (30.5% vs. 12.6%, P < 0.001) and live birth rate (23.9% vs. 9.7%, P < 0.001) compared with poor-quality embryos. Logistics regression analysis revealed that embryo quality was not correlated with miscarriage rate (95% CI 0.33–1.89) and pregnancy complications (95% CI 0.12–7.84). Maternal age and body mass index was a risk factor for miscarriage rate (95% CI 1.05–1.22) and pregnancy complication (95% CI 1.01–1.29), respectively.
Conclusion
Clinical miscarriage rate and pregnancy complication were embryo quality independent. Maternal age was the risk factor for miscarriage rate. Embryo quality did not affect miscarriage once a clinical pregnancy is achieved.}

Much research has been conducted on improving operational performance of a container port over the past decades by enhancing the handling efficiency at each sub-system, eliminating unproductive moves, and synchronizing the handshake activities between them. The high operational performance is achieved by efficiently scheduling handling activities of containers for each ship based on standardized operational processes, unless unexpected events disrupt container workflows in the operational processes. Therefore, it is imperative to effectively control the operational processes by looking into the manageability of container workflows. This study employs an event-based learning approach to analyze the operational discrepancy of container workflows in operational processes and estimate operational manageability in view of the proposed management components (i.e., logistics, machine, and time) from the analytical outcomes. The comparative experiments were conducted on a real-world dataset to estimate the operational manageability of a container port for ships of various shipping liners.}

abstract = {Hospital facilities are known as functionally complex buildings. There are usually configurational problems that lead to inefficient transportation processes for patients, medical staff, and/or logistics of materials. The Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP) is a well-known problem in the field of Operations Research from the category of the facility's location/allocation problems. However, it has rarely been utilized in architectural design practice. This paper presents a formulation of such logistics issues as a QAP for space planning processes aimed at renovation of existing hospitals, a heuristic QAP solver developed in a CAD environment, and its implementation as a computational design tool designed to be used by architects. The tool is implemented in C# for Grasshopper (GH), a plugin of Rhinoceros CAD software. This tool minimizes the internal transportation processes between interrelated facilities where each facility is assigned to a location in an existing building. In our model, the problem of assignment is relaxed in that a single facility may be allowed to be allocated within multiple voxel locations, thus alleviating the complexity of the unequal area assignment problem. The QAP formulation takes into account both the flows between facilities and distances between locations. The distance matrix is obtained from the spatial network of the building by using graph traversal techniques. The developed tool also calculates spatial geodesic distances (walkable, easiest, and/or shortest paths for pedestrians) inside the building. The QAP is solved by a heuristic optimization algorithm, called Iterated Local Search. Using one exemplary real test case, we demonstrate the potential of this method in the context of hospital layout design/re-design tasks in 3D. Finally, we discuss the results and possible further developments concerning a generic computational space planning framework.}

It was observed that the performance of these supply chain needs to be improved in various dimensions. Therefore, generic drug distribution in Rajasthan is studied and analyzed in the current study. The different aspects of generic drug distribution considered in the study are process view of the existing supply chain, sourcing, ordering and procurement, logistics and warehousing, inventory management and information system. The use of various techniques such as value stream mapping, inbuilt analytical tool for ordering, 5S practice and performance measurement system is explored to develop a strategy for improved resource utilization.}

Nevertheless, under the OBOR initiative, FLCPP is greatly influenced by the government policy for regional development and the uncertain demand incurred by the enormous difference of economic form, custom and culture awareness among the involved countries. This study focuses on a special FLCPP under the OBOR initiative, in which the uncertainties of both policy preference and customer demand are considered simultaneously. To cope with these two categories of uncertainties, this study proposes a simulation-based optimization approach that includes the rough simulation and fine simulation methods. The former aims at finding a set of feasible decisions by using fuzzy and stochastic simulation, while the latter is used to achieve the best decision from the obtained feasible decisions by hybridizing the stochastic simulation with optimal computing budget allocation and mathematical programming. In order to demonstrate the application and advantage of the proposed approach, simulation experiments are conducted and experimental results show that this approach performs well in dealing with the concerned problem as well as some managerial insights and policy suggestions are obtained according to the analysis and results.}

In this problem, there are healthcare, treatment, and disposal centers. Locations of healthcare centers are known, however, it is required to select appropriate locations for treatment, recycling, and disposal centers. Healthcare wastes are divided into infectious and non-infectious wastes. Since a great volume of healthcare wastes are infectious, the emission of contamination can have obnoxious impacts on the environment. The proposed problem considers a stochastic essence for the emission of contamination which depends on the transferring times. In this respect, transferring times between healthcare and treatment centers have been considered as normal random variables. As transferring time increases, it is more likely for the contamination to spread. Having visited a treatment center, infectious wastes are sterilized and they will no longer be harmful to the environment. This research develops a bi-objective mixed-integer mathematical formulation to tackle this problem. The objectives of this model are minimization of total costs and emission of contamination, simultaneously. Complexity of the proposed problem led the researchers to another contribution. This study also develops a Multi-Objective Water-Flow like Algorithm (MOWFA), which is a meta-heuristic, to solve the problem. This algorithm uses a procedure based on the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) to rank the non-dominated solutions in the archive set. By means of a developed mating operator, the MOWFA utilizes the best ranked solutions of the archive in order to obtain high quality offspring. Two neighborhood operators have been designed for the MOWFA as the local search methods. Extensive computational experiments have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the MOWFA on several test problems compared with other meta-heuristics, namely the Multi-Objective Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (MOICA) and Multi-Objective Simulated Annealing (MOSA). These experiments also include a real healthcare waste logistic network in Iran. The computational experiments demonstrate that our proposed algorithm prevails these algorithms in terms of some well-known performance evaluation measures.}

Autonomous delivery vehicles (ADVs) are believed to have the potential to revolutionise last-mile delivery in a way that is more sustainable and customer focused. However, if not widely accepted, the introduction of ADVs as a delivery option can be a substantial waste of resources. At present, the research on consumers’ receptivity of innovations in last-mile delivery, such as ADVs, is limited. This study is the first that investigates the users’ acceptance of ADVs in Germany by utilising an extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) and adapted it to the context of ADVs in last-mile delivery. Quantitative data was collected through an online survey approach (n = 501) and structural equation modelling was undertaken. The results indicate that price sensitivity is the strongest predictor of behavioural intention (i.e., user acceptance), followed by performance expectancy, hedonic motivation, perceived risk, social influence and facilitating conditions, whereas no effect could be found for effort expectancy. These findings have important theoretical and practical contributions in the areas of technology acceptance and last-mile delivery.}

abstract = {Introduction
As coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) spread worldwide and social restrictions were intensified, difficulties in blood supply were expected to result in a shortage of blood donors, logistic issues and a change in blood consumption. Consequences could be detrimental to the meeting of the blood supply demand, especially in a decentralized blood bank in the State of São Paulo responsible for providing blood to more than 100 hospitals, mostly of the public health system. Aiming to minimize negative effects and focusing on maintenance of the blood supply, a different approach was discussed and adopted.
Materials and methods
Briefly, strategies were related to monitoring and promoting measures to achieve a positive RBC unit balance. Thus, the number of donors, transfusions, RBC unit inventory, RBC unit loss and RBC units within up to 5 days from the expiration date were evaluated.
Results
Several strategies were adopted to ensure sufficient availability of RBC units: blood donation was improved with social media and extra blood collections, a restrictive transfusion protocol was implemented, a new logistic process to use RBC units closer to the expiration date was established and non-isogroup transfusions were avoided.
Conclusion
Altogether, described strategies were crucial to optimize blood storage during the pandemic. Investing in monitoring and logistics contributed to a positive RBC unit balance and conserving these strategies could be useful.}

First, the consensus on the BDDCE practices within the group was ascertained followed by determining the decision weights using the percentage distributions and subjective weights. This was followed by the by computing the dominance degrees on pairwise comparisons of the BDDCE practices and ranking them using the PROMETHEE II method. The findings indicated that the BDDCE practices that were more inclined towards the enhancement of internal supply chain integration were most preferred and highly ranked by the decisionmakers in the auto-component industry as compared to the practices that were focused on improving the supplier and customer interfaces such as green purchasing, sale of excess inventory, and developing recycling systems for end-of-life products and materials . The high ranked BDDCE practices included minimization of the raw material consumption, plan for reuse, recycle, recovery of material, parts, and reduction of the process waste at the design stage.}

abstract = {The demand for wood biofuel for district heating plants and combined heat and power plants (CHPs) has increased, caused by an increase in both the number and size of CHPs. This places large demands on the logistics system supplying these plants with fuel, with a particular interest in the use of alternative modes of transport such as rail and sea. The aim of this paper is to identify the industry actors’ requirements, constraints, and preferences regarding the wood-biofuel supply chain and to identify the logistical challenges this entails, as well as how this impacts the opportunity for an increased use of alternative transport solutions. A survey was sent to all Swedish CHPs, combined with six interviews with transport companies, terminal operators, and forest companies. The study shows that the industry has a local focus that limits potential logistics and sourcing solutions. It is also challenged by urban sprawl, with expanding residential areas close to the CHPs putting further constraints on the operations. Significant variations in fuel demand, depending on unpredictable outside temperature and seasonal variation, is a further challenge. The low density of the fuel has a negative impact on transport costs and introduces a trade-off between chipping close to the forest to increase density versus more efficient chipping at the CHP. Intermodal transport only used by large plants, driven by a shortage of local fuel.}

abstract = {Recent empirical evidence suggests that delivery to retail warehouses suffers from a lack of coordination. While carriers try to optimize their routes, they often experience very long waiting times at loading docks, which renders their individual planning useless. To reduce such inefficiencies, carriers need to coordinate. This problem has received considerable attention in practice, but the design of coordination mechanisms is challenging for several reasons: First, the underlying package assignment problem is NP-hard. Second, efficiency, incentive-compatibility, and fairness are important design desiderata, but in most economic environments they are conflicting. Third, the market for logistics services is competitive and price-based mechanisms where carriers might have to pay for time slots suffer from low acceptance. We draw on recent advances in market design, more specifically randomized matching mechanisms, which set incentives for carriers to share information truthfully such that a central entity can coordinate their plans in a fair and approximately efficient way. We use and adapt the existing maximizing cardinal utilities (MAXCU) framework to a retail logistics problem, which yields a new and powerful approach for coordination. We report numerical experiments based on field data from a real-world logistics network to analyze the average reduction in waiting times and the computation times required and compare to first-come, first-served and an auction mechanism. Our results show that randomized matching mechanisms provide an effective means to reduce waiting times at warehouses without requiring monetary transfers by the carriers. They run in polynomial time and provide a practical solution to wide-spread coordination problems.}

abstract = {The search for higher efficiency in transportation planning processes in real life applications is challenging. The synchronisation of different vehicles performing interrelated operations can enforce a better use of vehicle fleets and decrease travelled distances and non-productive times, leading to a reduction of logistics costs. In this work, the full truck-load pickup and delivery problem with multiple vehicle synchronisation (FT-PDP-mVS) is presented. This problem is motivated by a real-life application in the biomass supply chain “hot-system”, where it is necessary to simultaneously perform chipping and transportation operations at the forest roadside. The FT-PDP-mVS consists in determining the integrated routes for three distinct types of vehicles, which need to perform interrelated operations with minimum logistics costs. We extend existing studies in synchronisation of multiple routes by acknowledging several synchronisation aspects, such as operations and movement synchronisation. A novel mixed integer programming model (MIP) is presented, along with valid inequalities to tighten the formulation. A solution method approach is developed based on the fix-and-optimise principles under a variable neighbourhood decomposition search. Results of its application to 19 instances based on a real-world case-study demonstrate its performance. For a baseline instance, the synchronisation aspects tackled in this problem allowed for significant gains when compared to the company’s current planning approach. Furthermore, the proposed approach can enhance planning and decision making processes by providing valuable insights about the impact of key parameters of biomass logistics over the routing results.}

An optimization model coupling Dynamic Programming and Integer Programming is developed to optimize carrier revenue based on historical data of transport flows. The proposed model is studied in the context of the Physical Internet (PI). PI can be considered as a global interconnected logistics system that connects logistics networks via open logistics hubs. In each hub, LTL requests of different volumes and destinations arrive continually and are immediately allocated or reallocated to carriers. Carriers can bid for these requests through participating auctions. Carriers are confronted with numerous heterogeneous requests and must select one or several requests to bid for while at the same time deciding on a bidding price to maximize profit. Moreover, the carrier needs to forecast the number of requests at the destination hub to improve total profit, for example by improving the backhaul fill-rate. In this research, the number of requests is formulated as a distribution function due to uncertainty. Then, the optimization model is used for a multi-leg dynamic pricing and request selection decision. An experimental study based on real data is conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of the model and the impact of transport forecasting uncertainty on carrier revenue.}

Aiming at selecting the best biomass fuel procurement and storage modes in Jilin province, this paper proposes an evaluation model with linguistic hesitant fuzzy sets (LHFSs), which is good at expressing the hesitancy, inconsistency and uncertainty of subjective evaluation information. Based on cloud model and three entropy principle, the transformation between linguistic hesitant fuzzy sets and comprehensive cloud model is realized. In order to eliminate interdependency among criterion, a new Choquet integral aggregation operator based on the Sigmoid function is proposed. According to the expectation values, the ranking result of aggregated LHFSs is obtained. At last, an illustrative example of modes evaluation in Jilin province is taken in the present study to make the proposed method comprehensible. The result shows that mode 3: farmer + middleman + third-party logistics + power plant, is the most reasonable mode for Jilin biomass energy development. From the perspective of supply chain, middlemen and third party logistics can reduce the procurement and transportation cost in the supply chain, which are two bigger influential factors of fuel cost. Middlemen are not only a bridge between plants and farmers, but also the operator in the supply chain. Through the analysis of the result, suggestions from the perspective of power plants and the government are given.}

In this context, industrial production processes are changing thanks to the development of green strategies. The selection of a new production solution is a crucial strategic decision and the introduction of new technologies could cause deep changes to the entire supply chain configuration. This paper introduces a new approach designed to understand the importance of supply chain considerations for a suitable technology assessment. It is aimed at proposing a quantitative model for the evaluation of different structure of supply chains based on different production technologies. In particular, by defining a set of Key Performance Indicators and applying a multi-criteria decision method, a final score is computed, giving important information about both environmental and economic aspects. A numerical example regarding the comparison between Additive and Traditional Manufacturing processes is presented in order to demonstrate the applicability and the effectiveness of the proposed method. Results show that additive solutions bring evident reduction in Carbon Emission and better supply chain and logistics performance. Anyway, production volume strongly influences the economic results and the competitiveness of additive manufacturing remains limited when compared to the traditional manufacturing.}

Two data sources, Medline and Nursing databases, were searched for peer-reviewed papers written in English or Japanese. CiNii and Ichi-shi Web were searched for papers in Japanese. Articles written in English or Japanese and published from March 2011 to April 2019 were included. For further information within the month of the disaster, newspaper articles from Asahi Shimbun and Yomiuri Shimbun were also searched, as well as an inquiry report published by the National Diet of Japan. After screening, 66 articles and a book were included. In the acute phase of the disaster, problems around logistics and human resources resulted in the most severe damage to healthcare facilities, despite the relatively limited structural damage. Hospital evacuation posed a large problem, and ill-planned evacuations resulted in increased mortality among evacuated patients. No literature described direct impacts of radiation exposure, or radiation screenings, to the functioning of healthcare facilities. In the chronic phase, issues around human resources including staff shortages and mental health deterioration among healthcare staff remained as major problems. In conclusion, after the Fukushima nuclear disaster and subsequent social disruption, there was prominent damage to the infrastructure and logistics of healthcare facilities, and staff shortages at local healthcare facilities continued long-term.}

They may lack the representation of characteristics that are specific to emerging economies, such as policy priorities, changing governmental and regulatory structures, unstable development rates, speed of technological diffusion, transition from traditional to contemporary logistics systems, changes in the competitive structure of logistics industries, and long-term uncertainties in market structure. Such features need to be explicitly addressed in freight transportation models to enable meaningful policy analysis.

The results show that: the relation between formal environmental regulation and innovation is inverse U-shaped. Spatial self-selection of environmental regulation in the Yangtze River Delta region weakens the enthusiasm of innovation to a certain extent. This paper argues that the main mechanisms through which environmental regulation affects innovation development are spillover effects and industrial structure effects.

While food loss and waste (FLW) prevention and management are well-studied in the literature, research in CE is more recent. Through a systematic literature review, this study creates a taxonomy that synthesises the key aspects of FLW under the CE. 297 papers were reviewed and analysed using keyword co-occurrence analysis (KCN) and structural dimension analysis. In KCN, three research themes emerge: impact assessment, biorefinery, and nutrient recycling. Structural dimension analysis reveals the types of research methods, types of FLW flows, FLW prevention and management options with associated opportunities and challenges, and the sustainability impact assessment (SIA) addressed in the literature. A taxonomy is presented and future research directions are highlighted under six research streams: i) FLW supply and quantification, ii) practices and technological aspects, iii) logistics and supply chain management, iv) market demand, v) SIA, and vi) policy and legislation. Combining insights from CE and FLW prevention and management, the taxonomy helps key stakeholders, including industry practitioners to grasp new business opportunities, politicians to set up support strategies and strategic development plans, society to recognise the benefits of waste-oriented bioeconomy, and consumers to raise their awareness and be actively involved in CE.}

By applying the experience in developing other areas of the Russian Federation and some territories abroad, it is safe to say that these changes will lead to transportation problems, which will be primarily associated with active road construction and an increase in the number of vehicles. To minimize transportation problems that may arise soon in the Arctic zone, this study identifies the main ways to solve them.}

abstract = {This paper develops a new approach to select a common projection direction for performance evaluation of decision-making units (DMUs) using the data envelopment analysis (DEA) directional distance function. First, we define the concept of directional extensibility of a specific projection direction with respect to a set of inefficient DMUs. The concept shows the projection direction’s ability in reducing inefficiencies, simultaneously, for all inefficient DMUs. Using this concept, we propose a model which identifies the common projection direction that has the maximum directional extensibility. However, this common projection direction may contain zero elements. To avoid this problem and to select the final common projection direction, an algorithm is developed to select the common projection direction which is resulted in a trade-off between the directional extensibility and the similarity among the elements of the common projection direction. Our developments contribute by formally defining a concept (i.e., the directional extensibility) which can well reflect a common projection direction’s ability in reducing the DMUs’ inefficiencies. Moreover, the selected final common projection direction has both good directional extensibility and no zero elements, which helps to guide the inefficient DMUs to develop in a balanced way because the direction suggests the DMUs to improve in all inputs and outputs. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of our proposed approach by using an empirical case of 18 logistics companies listed among China’s top 500 enterprises in 2018.}

However, many questions remain unanswered regarding upscaling, the balancing of its multipurpose nature, and how it should be embedded into the broader urban system. This review looks at a breadth of novel insights that are indicative for sensible future development, including new possibilities for nutrient circularity, opportunities for increased sustainability and open questions regarding logistics and economics and development pathways. A thorough assessment of the existing self-sufficiency studies is provided to advance the debate on expected productivity, which is highly dependent on the intended outcomes and the choice of practices employed. Addressing resource circularity, decentralized anaerobic digestion and vermicomposting are presented as methods of utilizing organic waste in urban agriculture, in particular food and garden waste. Furthermore, critical aspects of sustainability are synthesized and promising developments, such as the co-location of micro-scale anaerobic digestion and greenhouses, are evaluated and research gaps regarding life cycle assessments and technical understanding identified. The review also identifies three aspects of urban agriculture upscaling that have not been well studied, namely logistics, economic performance and business models, and institutional and civil development. Finally, the realization of the transformative potential of urban agriculture based on industrial ecology and inclusive co-design is discussed.}

Enterprise complex problems could be solved in this frame. Many methods and concepts presented in the literature are focused on these aspects. A new method is being developed in Icam Paris-Sénart around the idea that sustainability must be the kernel of “industry of the future”. Indeed, the framework proposed is a combination of the previous aspects with environmental, social and societal aspects. The actual situation of the planet is an encouragement to make all future transformations with sustainability as kernel. These concepts could be imported in healthcare logistics and transport area for solving specific problems of this domain. Icam (French Engineer school) and FEI University are collaborating for proposing to healthcare hospitals a new framework (healthcare logistics 4.0) for solving complex problems of this domain. This paper is focusing on how to improve medicines procurement and dispatching in a hospital. Indeed, the use of Artificial Intelligence in healthcare sector is growing up. Data treated and analyzed could give important insights for solving problems and improving the existing organization. As machine learning is already exploited in many production management problems (forecasting, storage, production, etc.), the idea is to use it for developing an aided tool in addition to a lean manufacturing classical approach. After presenting the real problem of medicines procurement and dispatching detected in healthcare hospitals, concepts of lean manufacturing and machine learning will be exposed. Then, the methodology proposed for solving the problem will be shown. An illustration will be given for validating concepts presented. Finally, the link with the global “Healthcare logistics 4.0” framework will be described.}

abstract = {Not only has the COVID-19 pandemic caused a global health crisis, but it has also changed the dynamics of waste generation around the world. This situation demands a productive solution for face mask (FM) waste management to solve several associated environmental issues. In the current study, a novel soil treatment method is proposed for the improvement of mechanical characteristics of fat clay by using FM as fiber reinforcement and silica fume (SF) as the cementitious agent in the form of a composite binary admixture (CBA). The performance of the proposed CBA is compared with SF and FM as the lone stabilizers by conducting extensive geotechnical testing. The SF treatment exponentially improves the strength characteristics of soil but it marginalizes the ductility of soil, inviting sudden failure and instability under dynamic loadings. It is observed that the proposed CBA not only improves the strength characteristics more than SF but also regulates the ductility and deformability of treated soil due to the presence of FM fibers. In addition, the policies and protocols on the logistics of collecting FM waste and making it ready for the proposed geotechnical application are reviewed; associated health risks, socioeconomic conditions and available technologies are the major governing factors to formulate and implement these policies. Moreover, the prolonged storage of COVID-19 FM waste for disinfection is found to be suitable for the proposed soil stabilization method as per the literature. The current study helps in achieving cost-effective filler/foundation material, solving COVID-19 FM waste problems and promoting resource conservation.}

abstract = {In this paper, we have evaluated the scope of deploying digital technologies like IoT to improve the performance of the cold supply chain. A scenario has been considered where the retailer source fresh produce from the supplier and has outsourced its logistics operations to a third party logistics provider (3PL). 3PL’s service level affects the sellable quality and quantity of the produce; however, to improve its service level, the 3PL has to incur additional cost on freshness keeping effort. The retailer can decide the quantity to be sourced from the supplier and whether to employ digital technologies like IoT or not. Moreover, both 3PL and retailer being independent entities, it has been assumed that the retailer has no direct control over freshness keeping effort provided by 3PL. We have examined the case in a newsvendor problem setting, where the freshness of the product influences its randomly distributed demand. In this paper, it has been proved that incorporating IoT can immediately improve the cold chain profits. Our analysis asserts the channel power that large retailers like Walmart enjoy, and outlines the scope for coordination and cooperation in the presence of IoT.}
