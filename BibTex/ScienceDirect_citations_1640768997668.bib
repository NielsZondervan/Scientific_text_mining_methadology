abstract = {The importance of transportation and logistics in the biomass supply chain has been recognized, yet the specific research on those topics has been limited. This paper reviews the peer-reviewed literature to assess the current challenges, trends, and ideas in the biomass transportation and logistics research. All papers were selected based on three English keywords: transportation, logistics, and biomass. We addressed literature statistics per research category and then discussed four criteria that significantly influence the viability of the supply chain: transportation/logistics cost, shipping distance, plant capacity, and system efficiency. A brief review of industry literature was also conducted to identify topics potentially absent from the peer-reviewed literature. The study findings included the great variability of values used in the literature, both related to the fixed and variable costs of transportation and to the optimal shipping distance based on logistics conditions. From transportation mode and plant capacity perspective, we found that studies have concentrated on improving system efficiency of truck transportation for smaller plants while large plants have received less attention. The research gaps included the seemingly poor fit of typical logistics and supply chain frameworks with biomass systems. There is also a lack of sustainable transportation cost model to account for economic, environmental, and social factors. Finally, there is a need to explore the effects of feedstock conversion and upgrading options to biomass transportation logistics (BTL) and to combine the BTL studies with long-term biomass sourcing strategies to mitigate supply variations.}

abstract = {Globalization has led to an increased need for international freight transportation and, with it, international logistics. To measure the performance of countries in terms of logistics, in 2007 the World Bank created the Logistics Performance Index (LPI), which uses six core indicators to rank countries with regard to their overall logistics performance. In the past decade, the LPI has been widely used by policymakers and researchers to formulate measures on logistics and freight transportation. At the moment, however, the different indicators are all regarded as being equally important when the overall index score is calculated, which seems highly unlikely within the complex system of logistics. This research assigns weights to the six components using the Best Worst Method (BWM), a multi-criteria decision-analysis method. A questionnaire among 107 experts from different countries found significant differences with the equal weights used in the current LPI. Infrastructure is considered the most important component for logistics performance, with a weight of 0.24, more than twice as important as tracking and tracing, which is considered to be the least important factor, with a weight of 0.10. The findings are relevant for policymakers in transportation and logistics. Although the weights now have only a mild effect on rankings due to the correlation between the LPI indicators, they may point towards different policy priorities compared to the current LPI. Our results also point out some possible weaknesses in the LPI methodology.}

An interpretive structural modelling methodology was applied for establishing the interrelationship between the identified barriers and to rank the barriers based on their driving power. The results of the study revealed that a barrier namely ‘inadequate government policies, organisational policies, and lack of top management commitment’ was the most significant. Findings of this study are intended to guide the decision and policy makers in understanding the reverse logistics barrier analysis so that the most significant barriers can be eliminated for the effective reverse logistics and enhancing the performance of the automotive oil manufacturing companies.}

To ensure these expected outcomes, logistics outsourcing processes must be managed with appropriate governance mechanisms, but their effects on firm performance have hitherto been inconclusive in the literature due to overlooking of operational mechanisms. This study aims to shed light on the effects of the outsourcing management process (OMP), which is an operational mechanism, on the following two types of logistics service outsourcing: basic outsourcing and advanced outsourcing. By drawing upon resource-based views, we validated a proposed model based on survey data collected from 250 subsidies of publicly listed manufacturers in China. The results revealed that OMP affects the effectiveness of the two types of logistics outsourcing differently. While basic logistics outsourcing affects cost and delivery directly, advanced logistics outsourcing influences the performances via interaction with OMP. This study is the first to report this relationship. This study further makes a contribution by showing the conditional utility of OMP and its service-dependent nature, which has usually been ignored in the literature.}

A dynamic programming model is constructed for a multi-period resource allocation dispatch problem extracted to represent the disaster response phase, with special attention paid to the human suffering resulting from the delivery delay. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to validate the computational performance and solution quality of the dynamic programming method. Based on the best solutions, an optimal delivery pattern with a cyclically sequenced feature is identified and its sufficient condition is provided as well. Furthermore, a piecewise linear method is proposed to accommodate large-scale instances that cannot be applied to the “Cyclic Delivery Approach”.}

For this, a model which identifies the elements that affect the capacity of an airport to attract cargo operations and air cargo airlines has been developed. The identification of the elements of the model has been performed through a sectoral review of air cargo, an analysis of the entire logistics chain including the physical flow, the documentary flow, and all the agents involved in it. The analysis of the logistics chain has been carried out from the operational, technological, socio-economic and environmental standpoint, considering all the factors that influence the competitiveness of the logistics chain. Specifically, the operational characteristics that an air cargo transport requires both at the airport infrastructure and the logistics operators level, the technologies for the handling of freight and its control (on land and on-board) have been examined. Other characteristics include the different types of products transported according to their characteristics, the associated supply chains considering locations and routes with their origins and destinations, and the existing markets with the main demands of each type of merchandise. The model has been developed by using the Analytic Hierarchy Process methodology with absolute measurements. This methodology considers the judgements of experts in terms of the weightings of the different factors and attributes that constitute the model. The Zaragoza airport has been used for the model assessment. Furthermore, minimum thresholds were established for the attributes. Thus, it is obtained a model that allows an analysis of the improvement capabilities of airports focused on air cargo activity.}

The incorporation of this concept within the overall objective of minimizing the so-called “social costs” (logistics costs plus deprivation costs) promises to unify the objective functions of optimization models for humanitarian logistics applications. Although the deprivation cost concept is able to cover the majority of all those optimization criteria previously used in the literature in this field that are not yet covered by logistics costs, the question whether it also addresses the criterion of equity (fairness) remains open. In the first part of our work, we show by analytical results that minimization of total deprivation cost under a fixed given budget can lead to arbitrarily unfair solutions. For this reason, we propose to extend the deprivation cost objective by a term proportional to the well-known Gini inequity index. A computational solution procedure for a corresponding logistics model is presented, and its merits compared to the utilitarian version are demonstrated at an illustration case with data from the Nepal earthquake 2015. In particular, it is shown that practically irrelevant final reductions of average deprivation costs result in substantial increases of inequity, or vice versa, at a low “price of fairness”, dramatic reductions of the Gini inequity index can be achieved.}

Despite this, scholars and practitioners have dedicated little attention to setting up efficient indicators able to define the effect that infrastructure investments have on industrial activities. Many theoretical and empirical studies have been dedicated to calculating the exact numerical effect of infrastructure investment on social wellbeing, but their explicative capacity has always proved to be scarce since it is difficult work and with high levels of arbitrariness. This work becomes much more difficult when it aims to determine the effects on industrial efficiency. In this paper, we will use an indicator to overcome the problems related to determination of the exact economic impact of infrastructure investment on an economic region or local territory and suggest land use policy models to analyse infrastructure economic impacts. More specifically, we will focus our attention on the factors affecting logistics and economic performance within the economic regions around twenty major European ports. By using the new ACIT (Autoregulation, Compensation, Invariance and Transversality) indicator, we show that positive effects, deriving from port logistics interventions, can occur in those regions that have an ACIT indicator positively associated with other variables, such as propensity to innovation and level of education. This indicator represents a starting point to study how, in the better performing regions, it could be possible to develop logistics services able to stimulate a higher level of transport demand and, at the same time, respect high standards in environmental quality. Finally, we explain how an improvement in logistics performances of a port region may determine an improvement in its socioeconomic and environmental conditions.}

The aim is to reduce the number of fossil combustion powered commercial vehicles traveling within city boundaries, solely for goods transportation, thus contributing to reduce negative effects of urban logistics activities, namely pollution, noise, traffic congestion and accidents. Also, integrating goods and passenger flows will promote higher efficiency rates for the passenger transport network and enhance living conditions within major urban centers. A mathematical model for the operational planning of the proposed urban logistics distribution service is proposed. This model consists of assigning origins loads (or requests) to inbound hubs (bus operator centers), transferring the inbound hubs loads to a bus service, and transferring the bus loads to bus stops, to be collected by micro-logistics operators operating environmentally friendly vehicle fleets. The objective is to minimize the total service time while assuring services synchronization along the network and balancing the loads with the system capacities.}

The goal of this research is to identify if and how traditional logistics service providers are adjusting to e-developments in retail. Our results show that their adjustments can be categorised into four strategies: business partnership, customer service, acquisition and expansion. Drivers behind these adjustments are the need to customise, specialise and extend their offer, to respond to retailers’ and consumers’ demand and to address sustainability matters.}

Logistics activities play a prominent role in enabling manufacturers, distribution channels, and pharmacies to work in harmony. Nowadays these activities have become increasingly striking in the pharmaceutical industry and seen as a development area for this sector. Additionally, green practices are beginning to be more attracting particularly in decreasing costs and increasing image of pharmaceutical companies.
Objective
The main objective of this study was modeling green logistics (GL) behavior of the managers in the pharmaceutical sector in the theory of planned behavior (TPB) frame via structural equation modeling (SEM).
Methods
A measurement tool was developed according to TPB. Exploratory factor analysis was conducted to determine subfactors of GL behavior. In the second step, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted for confirming whether there is a relationship between the observed variables and their underlying latent constructs. Finally, structural equation model was conducted to specify the relationships between latent variables.
Results
In the proposed green logistics behavior (GLB) model, the positive effect of environmental attitude towards GL, perceived behavioral control related GL, and subjective norm about GL on intention towards GL were found statistically significant. Nevertheless, the effect of attitude towards costs of GL on intention towards GL was not found statistically significant. Intention towards GL has been found to have a positive statistically significant effect on the GL behavior.
Conclusions
Based on the results of this study, it is possible to say that TPB is an appropriate theory for modeling green logistics behavior of managers. This model can be seen as a guide to the companies in the pharmaceutical sector to participate in green logistics.}

While reverse logistics brings several economic benefits, it seems to become a necessity for businesses to remain competitive in a world that environmental and social aspects of business activities are key to sustainable development. The operations and management of reverse logistics systems is a complex task that requires substantial level of infrastructure, technology, expertise and experience. Therefore, increasingly many business organizations tend to outsource their reverse logistics activities to third-party reverse logistics providers (3PRLPs). In this paper, we propose a multiple attribute decision making (MADM) model to rank and select 3PRLPs, using fuzzy step-wise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) to weight the evaluation criteria. Accordingly, a developed fuzzy complex proportional assessment of alternatives (COPRAS) was proposed to rank and select the sustainable 3PRLPs in the presence risk factors. The suggested model was applied to a case study from automotive industry. Eventually, COPRAS and COPRAS-G methods were considered for the purpose of comparison and validation. As a result, the most sustainable 3PRLP was selected. While incorporating risk factors into our analysis, our study shows that environmental and social drivers are increasingly becoming dominant when selecting 3PRLPs.}

The structure of each stage of the supply chain is completed by a set of arcs connected to the nodes and representing the flow of goods: each arc has a weight proportional to the cost incurred in between the two nodes it connects together.

In particular, the following multistage based logistics or SCM network models will be introduced: (1) the sugarcane SCM network model, (2) multiobjective supply chain network model, (3) flexible multistage logistics network model, and (4) multiobjective reverse logistics network model. In each model, we summarize the background, mathematical model, hybrid priority-based genetic algorithm and numerical experiment.

abstract = {We propose a novel scenario analysis-based approach to investigate the relationship between logistics performance and exports at a country level. Different from the existing scenario analysis methods that contain subjectivity in measuring consistency, the proposed approach uses objective information rather than expert opinions. We propose a binary integer program to select significantly different, consistent and small number of efficient scenarios. On the basis of the selected scenarios, we develop a new approach for evaluating the performance of strategies across a series of scenarios. Furthermore, the proposed approach is used to analyse the relationships between exports and the six indicators of the logistics performance index (LPI): customs, infrastructure, international shipments, logistics quality and competence, tracking and tracing, and timeliness. With the help of these case studies, conducted for Turkey and four other selected countries, namely Burundi, Zimbabwe, Brazil and Portugal, the proposed method is proved to be generally applicable.}

abstract = {Biomass logistics comprise of inter-dependent operations related to harvesting and collection, storage, pre-processing, and transportation. Its high cost represents one of the barriers in widespread use of biomass for energy and fuel production. Therefore, improving and optimizing biomass logistics are essential in overcoming this barrier. Biomass logistics was reviewed in a previous study that aimed at categorizing logistics operations, but the inherent issues and complexities, and how they were incorporated in mathematical models were not discussed in detail. The objective of this paper is to review the important features of biomass logistics operations, discuss how they were incorporated in mathematical optimization models, and explain the new trends in biomass logistics optimization. Differences between the models dealing with forest-based and agriculture-based biomass are highlighted. Important features incorporated in logistics models include demand-driven and supply-driven collection, collection of biomass in different forms, storage at intermediate facilities, biomass quality deterioration, inter-modal distribution for long-distance transportation, operational level transportation planning, and planning the pre-processing of biomass. Recent trends in biomass logistics models include the consideration of scattered availability of biomass across supply areas, uncertainties in biomass supply, integration with GIS, emissions from logistics operations, and traffic congestion due to biomass transportation. Most of the literature on biomass logistics focused on medium-term planning, while that for short-term planning is still in its infancy. The current biomass logistics models focused mainly on economic objectives, while environmental concerns related to emissions from logistics activities received limited attention. The trade-off between environmental and economic aspects of biomass logistics operations have not been investigated. Social aspects such as increase in traffic congestion due to biomass transportation received limited attention in the literature. Most of the previous models were tested on hypothetical cases, while developing suitable models to address practical issues in real case studies would be valuable.}

In this problem, the delivery of medication from a local pharmacy can occur via lockers, from where patients that are within the coverage distance of a locker can collect their medication, or by home delivery. The aim of the problem is to determine which lockers from a set of potential locker locations to open and to generate routes that visit the opened lockers and routes that visit the patients that are not covered by the opened lockers, while minimizing the routing costs and the opening costs of the lockers. We formally define this problem and solve it by applying a branch-and-bound algorithm to this mathematical formulation. Moreover, we propose a fast hybrid heuristic to solve the problem. Extensive computational results are given on a randomly generated instance set and an instance set inspired by practice from Alliance Healthcare Netherlands, an industrial partner. Our results indicate that our heuristic is able to consistently outperform a commercial solver applied to the mathematical formulation, and that its solutions are extremely robust. We provide important business insights on several parameters of the problem.}

The performance measurement of reverse logistics is seldom studied due to the complexity and uncertainty of its operations. This paper provides a multi-criteria performance measurement model to assess the reverse logistics enterprise’s performance by considering performance attributes such as product lifecycle stages, strategies, processes, capabilities, and perspectives and measures. In developing the performance measurement model, a hybrid multi-criteria approach combining DEMATEL, fuzzy ANP and AHP methods are applied. Furthermore, the relative importance of these attributes and their criteria with respect to each other and their contribution to the overall performance are affected by the competitive outlook considered by the reverse logistics enterprises. The performance evaluation model developed in this paper incorporates relevant attributes and achieves a more realistic representation of the enterprise’s performance by calculating the overall comprehensive performance index. This study provides decision makers a basis for improving the reverse logistics enterprise performance.}

Therefore, it is difficult for logistic companies to achieve highly-efficient and sustainable reverse logistics. This paper adopts a bottom-up logistics strategy that aims to achieve the real-time information-driven dynamic optimisation distribution for logistics tasks. Under this strategic framework, an IoT-enabled real-time information sensing model is designed to sense and capture the real-time data of logistics resources, which are shared among companies after the value-added processes. Real-time information-driven dynamic optimisation for logistics tasks is proposed to optimise the configuration of logistics resources, reduce logistics cost, energy consumption and the distribution distance, and alleviate the environmental pollution. The objective of this research is to develop an innovative logistics distribution model for sustainable logistics.}

For urban logistics firms, a reduction in the distance to their nearest highway increases their productivity performance. In contrast, for rural logistics firms, improvements in highway access show a positive impact on employment growth but have also led to a reduction in productivity growth for those rural logistics firms that remained outside highway corridors.}

In this process, influential factors such as drivers and barriers have to be examined, and stakeholders' different perspectives on RL implementation and development should also be considered. This paper presents a multi-perspective framework for reverse logistics implementation using the lens of stakeholder theory. The multiple stakeholders' perspective framework was developed based upon a structured literature review process. Fifty-four papers concerning these topical areas were thoroughly assessed and classified according to their structural dimensions and analytical categories. Two extensive lists of 37 drivers and 36 barriers, categorized and analyzed against the dimensions and categories, served as a basis for the development of the referred framework. Thereby, the overall contribution of this work proposes an understanding of the factors required for employing reverse logistics from multiple perspectives, including those of the company, society, government, and customer. Additionally, each perspective is discussed separately with the aid of previous works developed in the field. Most of the encountered barriers are placed in the firm's perspective; however, these barriers may be an effect from outside impediments. On the drivers' side, the factors must be acknowledged so managers can prepare for changes by exploring these positive influential factors. A consideration of the influential factors from multiple perspectives is critical for creating a comprehensive industry strategy to successfully implement product return.}

The idea of crowd logistics is that parcels and passengers are co-transported along a passenger trip that was intended to be made for another purpose. Due to the novelty of this concept and the fact that existing crowd logistics platforms are continuously changing, knowledge on the actual impact of crowd logistics is limited. To gain insight in crowd logistics' environmental impact and the involved stakeholders, we apply two methods. First, an impact analysis based on data of an operational crowd logistics platform in Belgium. We compare the external costs imposed on society when delivering a parcel with crowd logistics and with more traditional ways of transport. Second, an analysis of stakeholder support for crowd logistics, by applying a multi-actor multi-criteria analysis or MAMCA. The findings indicate that current platform use results in higher external transport costs and thus a higher environmental impact, when compared to traditional parcel delivery. Although the concept receives support from the main stakeholders, societal objectives are not met. A critical role in improving crowd logistics’ impact is reserved for the platform provider, who can adjust the platform operation and incentivisation to steer efficient vehicle use. Future research efforts can be allocated to other types of crowd logistics platforms and non-urban application of the concept.}

Long established in-situ construction practices are thus being replaced by processes imported from the manufacturing sector, where component fabrication takes place within a factory environment. As a result of this transformation, current construction supply chains, which have focused on the delivery of raw materials to sites, are no longer apt and need to make way to new, strengthened, and time-critical logistics systems. The aim of this study is to establish a mathematical model for the optimisation of logistics processes in modular construction covering three tiers of operation: manufacturing, storage and assembly. Previous studies have indicated that construction site delays constitute the largest cause of schedule deviations. Using the model outlined in this paper we seek to determine how factory manufacturing and inventory management should react to variations in the demand on construction sites. A two-stage stochastic programming model is developed to capture all possible demand variations on site. The model is evaluated using a case study from the residential construction sector. The application shows that the model is effective and can serve as decision support to optimise modular construction logistics.}

Their customers, the shippers, also play an important role in environmental development. Research has identified discrepancies between LSPs and shippers in their environmental practices. This paper takes a relational approach addressing these discrepancies, and the purpose is to develop the understanding of why environmental practices can both flourish and fade in provider-shipper relationships and networks. Paradoxes provide a theoretical lens, while an in-depth case study of two networks provides the empirical basis for the paper. The networks include relationships between LSPs and shippers. Findings show that paradoxes help to raise contextual awareness in the greening of these relationships. Paradoxes in many instances cause environmental practices to fade. One example is when an LSP's environmental ambition gives opportunities for environmental practices, but is limited by the financial goals of the shippers. Findings also indicate that if there are possibilities to relax the paradoxes, environmental practices may instead flourish in the relationships. One example of such a relaxation is environmental competence sustained and cultivated by an LSP, since such competence can increase the power position of the LSP.}

abstract = {Technological advances, with increasing numbers of products containing complex electronic circuitry, have resulted in e-waste becoming the fastest-growing global waste stream. High levels of embodied carbon in these products ensure that, to meet emissions reduction targets proposed by the United Nations Paris Agreement, tackling e-waste requires strategies to address climate change United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 13 (UNSDG13). This paper identifies the contribution improved reverse logistics can make to extending product lifetimes through facilitating reuse. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with academics, industry-leaders and policymakers in the United Kingdom and Europe. This research identified that improvements in availability and efficiency of reverse logistics processes would increase reuse potential and efficient resource recovery. Availability and efficiency challenges can be addressed through careful promotion, incentivisation, and engagement of existing compliance schemes. If these challenges are approached from a life cycle perspective, it will be possible to protect against value loss in global supply chains (UNSDG12) and address the climate action agenda.}

As a result, the truck shipment efficiency improved by 4%.}

Omni-channel retailers need to optimally determine how to select suitable logistics providers (LSPs) to help maintain their competitive advantage. Although there are many methods to solve the problem of LSP selection, most of them overlook the decision maker’s psychology. Most importantly, previous studies paid little attention to the probability of success for each candidate under each criterion. To compensate for these shortcomings, this study proposes a new method of logistics provider selection in an omni-channel environment. We present the model in three phases. The first phase involves computing the probability of success of each LSP with respect to each criterion through axiomatic design method. The second phase uses the perspective of the extended regret aversion/rejoice preference to develop a bounded rational decision making model for determining the criteria weights. In this phase, the regret/rejoice levels are treated as continuous parameters, whereby decision makers can regret and rejoice simultaneously. The final phase computes the expected perceived utility values to select the best LSP. To validate the capability of the proposed model, LSPs of six from a case study are ranked based on the proposed model, and the results are compared with the traditional regret and TOPSIS. The findings suggest that the proposed method provides more reasonable and reliable results, which are in line with the psychological behavior of human beings.}

On the other side, logistics indices linked with high mass carbon emissions, social factors, and trade openness, which need sustainable cleaner instruments for achieving broad-based growth. The results of panel causality confirmed the two-way linkages between country's per capita income and logistic indices, and socio-economic factors and logistics indices, while there is one –way causal relationship running from carbon-fossil emissions to logistics indices across countries.

Due to complexity of RL operations and the lack of available resource, outsourcing RL practices to third party reverse logistics provider (3PRLP) is preferred as a strategy. One of the most essential and risky processes for carrying out RL outsourcing is the selection of the optimal 3PRLP from alternatives. The 3PRLP selection is generally recognized as a hybrid-information multi-criteria decision making (HI-MCDM) problem incorporating multiple criteria which are usually in conflict with another criterion and expressed by various formats of information, i.e., crisp numbers, intervals, linguistic terms, and fuzzy numbers, for best retention of original assessment in fuzzy environment. The psychological behavior of decision maker (DM) in selection under environmental pressure has been proved to weigh heavily with decision solution, yet not been properly considered in existing literature. In response to this issue, the main evaluation criteria are investigated in this paper and an integrated cumulative prospect theory (CPT) based HI-MCDM approach is developed to appraise and identify sustainable 3PRLPs. The suggested approach is illustrated by a case study from computer manufacturing industry. Lastly, comparison with FTOPSIS and a sensitivity analysis are performed to confirm the validity and robustness. The results indicate that considering psychological factor in decision making contributes to avoiding potential loss risks. This study will offer informative insights to managers for outsourcing to a capable 3PRLP.}

abstract = {High cost of logistics is one of the barriers of using forest-based biomass for energy and fuel production. Biomass logistics is complex and includes interdependent decisions related to storage, pre-processing and transportation. While these decisions have been considered in numerous medium-term planning models, those for short-term planning are limited. The existing models focused only on optimal truck routing without considering intermediate storage facilities which are essential to match biomass supply and demand. In this study, a decomposition-based approach is used and optimization models are developed for the short-term planning of a large biomass logistics company located in the Lower Mainland region of British Columbia, Canada. The company deals with collection, storage, pre-processing and transportation of biomass. Several operational constraints related to truck-location compatibilities and truck-biomass compatibilities arising from heterogeneity of trucks and biomass types which further complicate the logistics planning are incorporated in the models. First, a transshipment model is developed and solved using a mixed integer formulation to determine comminution schedules and the number of truckloads of each biomass type to be transported each day using each type of truck. Then, a routing model, which uses the results of the transshipment model, is developed to determine the optimal routing for the available trucks. A decision support tool to optimize the company’s weekly transportation and comminution operations is also developed for the company. Experiments were conducted on real data from the company over a span of four weeks. The results indicate 12% reduction in the total average cost and a similar reduction in fuel consumption compared to the actual routes implemented by the company. It is suggested that savings could be obtained by using larger trucks for longer distance transportation and smaller trucks for shorter distances. Direct delivery of biomass from suppliers to customers, bypassing the yard, could result in cost savings.}

This study aims to stimulate interest in a research agenda aimed at evaluating this tradeoff. A general framework for investigating whether it is worthwhile to act on user-generated data prior to its absolute verification in the context of disaster response logistics planning is presented. While the framework is applicable to a variety of logistics planning problems, this paper demonstrates its use via an application in mobile delivery of disaster response commodities. A case study motivated by the 2010 Haiti earthquake is developed using real social data, and is presented for use in conjunction with the framework. The types of insights that are possible via the framework are revealed through the small computational study included in the paper.}

It further suggests that upon linking the dataset with appropriate variable(s) of interest, extended insights on logistics performance can be extracted. Therefore, a two-stage methodological framework is suggested for the mining of LPI dataset towards extended insights. The first stage involves the clustering of LPI dataset into finite clusters using K-means data mining algorithm. Subsequently, in the second stage, the suitability of multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) based regression is outlined for capturing the complex non-linear relationship between the variables under investigation. Thereby, the application of the proposed two-stage methodological framework is demonstrated with an example by linking the six LPI dimensions with an important macroeconomic variable. In addition to discussing the critical implications from the example towards extended insights on logistics performance, and its further implications towards the utility of the proposed methodological framework—the findings suggest that the extraction of extended insights from the LPI dataset is governed by the selection of appropriate variable(s) which can be linked with LPI dimensions, criteria of clustering in the first stage, and development of MARS models for the clusters and the overall data.}

In this study, the process of collecting and remanufacturing polyethylene terephthalate bottles was considered. A mixed-integer linear programming model for a reverse logistics network was designed. A real case study of polyethylene terephthalate bottles was implemented in one of the northern cities of Iran to show the applicability of the model.

Moreover, this paper provided effective and reliable managerial implication solutions for decision makers of polyethylene terephthalate bottle reverse logistics network. Two meta-heuristic algorithms, namely the genetic algorithm and imperialist competitive algorithm, were applied to solve large-scale problems. The efficiency of the two proposed algorithms and the optimum solution of the LINGO software were compared in terms of the CPU time and objective function value.

abstract = {One objective for countries in the European common market is to optimize the performance of their multimodal logistics chains. The attainment of this goal requires the continuous development of container ports' performance, better customer satisfaction and - at the same time - to deter the occurrence of waste and bottleneck. Many regions in Europe are shifting from a single-port to a multi-port gateway situation; their ports frequently have overlapping hinterlands and are therefore increasingly facing competition and rivalry between each other. This paper examines container ports located in six countries: Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and the UK. It focuses on sensitivities to the inclusion of country-specific measurements on logistics service delivery performance outcomes on port efficiency. Port efficiency is measured with Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). The results suggest that: (1) efficiency measurements for Danish, Finnish, Swedish and British ports are heavily influenced by whether logistics service delivery outcomes are included or not; (2) Icelandic and Norwegian ports appear to be not sensitive to whether logistics service delivery outcomes are included or not; (3) on average, the container ports located in countries that are directly called by deep-sea transcontinental container liners are over-performers and under-performers with regard to technical efficiency and scale efficiency, respectively. We further apply a second-stage regression analysis to explain the impact of country-specific contextual factors on DEA-based efficiency scores.}

The TSDSM model is based on the integration of the multi-criteria method of Weighted Linear Combination (WLC) and the modified Dijkstra algorithm within a geographic information system (GIS). The GIS is used for processing spatial data. The proposed model makes it possible to plan routes for green vehicles and maximize the positive effects on the environment, which can be seen in the reduction of harmful gas emissions and an increase in the air quality in highly populated areas. The scheduling of delivery vehicles is given as a problem of optimization in terms of the parameters of: the environment, health, use of space and logistics operating costs. Each of these input parameters was thoroughly examined and broken down in the GIS into criteria which further describe them. The model presented here takes into account the fact that logistics operators have a limited number of environmentally friendly (green) vehicles available. The TSDSM was tested on a network of roads with 127 links for the delivery of goods from the city logistics center to the user. The model supports any number of available environmentally friendly or environmentally unfriendly vehicles consistent with the size of the network and the transportation requirements.}

The system-generalized method of moment (GMM) regression model was used to investigate the data from Asian countries collectively and the four sub-regions of Asia. The estimates show that the logistics performance is significantly related to environmental degradation. International shipment in logistics performance index (LPI) significantly decreases CO2 emissions while timeliness of logistics significantly intensifies the CO2 emissions in Asian countries. Other sub-categories in LPI such as tracking and tracing, services quality and competence, infrastructure quality, and efficiency of customs also have a significant impact on the environment in different sub-regions of Asia. Industrialization and urbanization both increase CO2 emissions in Asian countries while trade openness decreases CO2 emissions. The results indicate a significant association between logistics performance and environment that accentuates the priorities on environmental sustainability and green supply chain management in Asian countries.}

But recently reverse logistics practices are faced with some barriers which make the implementation of reverse logistics difficult and unsuccessful. To increase efficiency in reverse logistics adaptation of the electronics industry, companies need to understand and consider the priorities of both barriers and solutions for developing policies and strategies to overcome these barriers. Therefore, this study focused on the classification of reverse logistics barriers and ranking of both barriers and solutions of reverse logistics implementation in the electronics industry. This paper proposes a methodology based on fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (Fuzzy AHP) and fuzzy technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (Fuzzy TOPSIS) in which fuzzy AHP is applied to get the weights of each barrier by using pairwise comparison, and fuzzy TOPSIS is applied for the final ranking of the solutions of reverse logistics implementation. The case of Thailand’s electronics industry is used in the proposed method. To illustrate the robustness of the method, sensitivity analysis is used in this study.}

A causal relationship diagram is provided depicting the interactions among the three critical components in terms of sustainability. Key findings indicate that FVs are able to break logistics bottlenecks which are hindering the implementation of farming-supermarket linking in China. On the other hand, as a special kind of FV, dry ports are highlighted due to their functions in providing a series of services similar to seaports, which can greatly promote the export of agri-products from inland areas. This paper provides practical guidelines and insights for researchers and practitioners dealing with APL issues in the face of sustainability challenges.}

Reverse logistics is the process for value recovery and re-creation through a series of activities, i.e., repair, remanufacturing, recycling and energy recovery. However, due to the stochastic reverse product flow, unstable quality of used products, and the price fluctuation of recycled and remanufactured products, the planning of a reverse logistics system is more complex compared with that of a forward supply chain. In this paper, we propose a two-stage stochastic bi-objective mixed integer programming model for the network design problem of a multi-product multi-echelon sustainable reverse logistics system under uncertainty, which aims at providing a set of Pareto solutions between profitability and environmental performance. Furthermore, due to the heterogeneous nature, the processing operations performed at remanufacturing and recycling centers for different products are by no means identical. Different from the previous modelling efforts derived from a genetic “capacitated location problem”, this paper considers the impact from the system flexibility on sustainable reverse logistics network design. Thus, the model is formulated in two parallel ways with either efficiency-focused non-flexible capacity or effectiveness-focused flexible capacity. The experimental analysis illustrates that increasing environmental requirement will decrease the profitability of the reverse logistics system, while, increasing flexibility may yield positive impacts on both economic and environmental performance when the efficiency loss is kept at a proper level.}

Reverse logistics activities involve the collection of returned products, inspection and sorting out into different categories, and disposition them for reuse, repair, remanufacturing or recycling. One of the important decisions is to disposition returned products appropriately for the success of reverse logistics. Disposition decision plays an important role in the performance of reverse logistics. Perusal of previous literature indicates that there are very few studies related to disposition of returned products in reverse logistics. This paper attempts to explore the various disposition alternatives and develop an approach for the selection of best disposition alternative using graph theory and matrix approach. A case of mobile manufacturing firm is discussed for the illustration of this approach. The firm has to select best disposition alternative among four identified alternatives such as returned products for repair or reuse and resell as new; or repair or refurbish and resell; or re-manufacture and sell; or recycle. Different disposition attributes are identified based on literature review and experts opinion. Graph theory and matrix approach has been applied to select the best alternative. Permanent function value, referred as “Disposition Index” was evaluated for each alternative with the help of C++ program and alternatives were prioritized based on these values. The results show that firm must repair or reuse and resell the returned mobile phones as new in present business scenario in India. In addition, recycling must be preferred over remanufacturing of returned mobile phones. The study prioritized alternatives for disposition of returned products in reverse logistics appropriately. The findings of the study will provide useful insight to the supply chain managers and researchers for disposition decision-making in reverse logistics.}

However, sometimes, the distance is not the most crucial factor when we want to represent certain relations. Thus, it may be important to represent jointly the travel time between two cities and the distances between them. In this representation greater distances are not always associated with longer times to drive. These maps, which also represents the time as a pseudo distance, would be useful for decision-making related to logistics management. This occurs in distribution logistics, where companies must meet delivery times, making prompt deliveries and timely deliveries. A software to perform comparative mapping from a source to a destination of distances and times between different geographical areas for road, rail and flight transport, would be useful for making decisions about what transport type should be used in order to minimize travel time between two points.

Results demonstrate the importance of an effective balance between chips and lumber production to ensure adequate quality of finished products as well as higher profits for the entire supply chain.

Taking advantage of a metro system’s underutilized capacity to transport same-day delivery items within a city during off-peak periods is not only innovative, but can mitigate the abovementioned urban transportation problems. In this paper, we locate the distribution hubs and construct a metro-integrated logistics system. First, we propose a segmentation method for the urban metro network. Second, based on the resulting sub-networks, indices for evaluating the importance of each metro station are selected by complex network theory and the weight of each evaluation index is calculated by AHP method. Moreover, the importance of each metro station is evaluated using the TOPSIS model and the candidate metro distribution hubs for location model are determined. Then, with the consideration of logistics demand, a location model is formulated to determine the final metro distribution hubs from the candidate metro distribution hubs. Finally, we choose the metro system of Shanghai as a case study and provide strategic planning for location selection of metro distribution hubs.}

Given that decision making in transport and logistics involves the consideration of a number of opposite criteria and possible solutions, such a selection can be considered as a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem. This study presents a new integrated approach to decision making, i.e. the generation of a robust decision making rule (RDMR) by combining different MCDM methods and Taguchi's robust quality engineering principles. As a logical implication of the proposed approach, a conceptual model of an adaptive and interactive expert system is developed. Its purpose is to enhance the decision making process through enabling the decision maker to: (i) use higher level knowledge regarding the selection of criteria weights and MCDM methods, (ii) estimate the ranking of a new alternative, which can be added to the initial decision matrix after a posteriori analysis of the final rankings of alternatives, and, moreover, quantify its distance from the ideal and the anti-ideal solution. Five different case studies in the field of transport and logistics were considered in order to illustrate the proposed approach. The obtained results and the results of the other MCDM methods were compared using Kendall's tau-b and Spearman's rho tests. An analysis of the final rank stability with respect to the changes in criteria weights was also performed so as to assess the sensitivity of the alternative rankings obtained by the application of different MCDM methods and the proposed approach. To this aim, the Monte Carlo simulation was conducted covering 1000 different scenarios of criteria weights in three different cases. Finally, an additional procedure was introduced for an explicit representation of an RDMR using the design of experiments (DOE) principles.}

In its 2014–2017 strategic plan, the UNHRD targeted the reduction of the operational costs of its network. This research project aims to analyze the potential cost benefits of adding a regional distribution center in Kampala, Uganda, to the existing network of the UNHRD in order to better respond to humanitarian crises in East Africa. To this end, we used fieldwork, simulation, network optimization and statistical analyses to assess the costs of prepositioning high-demand non-food items in Kampala and to propose a robust stocking solution. Our study is based on an actual case and uses real data. Results show that adding a regional depot in Kampala would be cost-efficient even if the UNHRD transport costs were subject to change. The UNHRD has already started to implement the solution proposed in this study, which should result in a mean cost reduction of around 21% over 5000 demand scenarios.}

Traditional literature has focused on either truckload utilization or vehicle routing operations but seldom integrating carbon emission mitigation in their daily trucking operations. This paper delineates the operation review of three third-party logistics firms in Hong Kong and develops an organisation-based carbon emission measurement metrics for logistics operations. The truckload utilization and routing performance are reviewed, followed by a correlation analysis on the truckload utilization against truck capacity, loading volume, fuel consumption, truck size, travelling distances and number of destinations. An integrated carbon-driven multi-criteria model is developed achieving carbon emission reduction initiatives, time and distance cost penalty, minimizing number of trucks, and improving truck utilization. The integrated mathematical model has been developed into a simulation system which has been tested with evaluated results. The mathematical model is enhanced for the set of cargo items and vehicle fleet with additional factors of arrival time slots and weight. The model assists traffic planners to reduce cargo planning time and optimize the truckload operations. Further development will be focused on adding the dimensions of pallet loading operations and exception rules for customer loading requirements.}

Compared with no contract, the buyback contract can coordinate the automobile LSSC better. Simulation results indicate that if the reliability increases, the optimal logistics capability order quantity, the buyback price and all expected profits decrease. If the penalty cost increases, the buyback price, the expected profits of LSI and LSSC decrease, while the optimal logistics capability order quantity and the expected profit of FLSP increase. Compared to the penalty cost, the relevant indexes are more sensitive to the reliability.}

Regression analyses using PROCESS revealed significant three-way interactions among role overload, role ambiguity, and role conflict. When both role ambiguity and role conflict were low, the negative consequences of role overload on employee outcomes were buffered. In other words, low role conflict and low role ambiguity helped insulate employees from the impact of role overload. Conversely, when both role ambiguity and role conflict were high, psychological strain, sleep disturbances, job dissatisfaction, and turnover intentions remained high, regardless of the level of role overload. Implications for theory and practice in the transport and logistics sector are discussed.}

It further suggests that engagement with key stakeholders may facilitate the implementation of environmental efforts at the supply chain level. Adopting this perspective, this study considers (i) whether downstream environmental logistics practices improve environmental and cost performance and; (ii) whether engagement with customers supports and enhances the relationship between downstream environmental logistics and performance. Using survey responses collected from 149 food manufacturing companies located within the UK, we find that adoption of downstream environmental logistics practices can generate environmental and cost performance benefits. We also find that the level of performance improvement deriving from these practices may be increased when companies engage with customers to tackle environmental concerns.

An ideal case is supposed in which all evaluation contexts lead to a consistent report on the performance of DMUs. Shannon entropy is employed to measure the entropy deviations of evaluation results from the real case to the ideal case. A constrained optimization model is constructed to integrate the results against multiple evaluation contexts into an overall performance score for each DMU.

Logistics centers have emerged as an important logistics infrastructure in supply chains. Hence, the problem of locating logistics centers plays a crucial role in designing and practicing logistics and supply chain management. Acknowledging the significance of logistics centers, Vietnam approved a master plan for the development of a logistics center system. However, the plan has been difficult to implementation because of the lack of the prioritization of the determinants used to locate logistics centers. This study aims to develop a benchmarking framework for choosing the locations of logistics centers based on the findings of logisticians by applying a hybrid of the fuzzy method and the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), both of which are utilized extensively to overcome problems in selecting locations. The results indicate that freight demand, closeness to market, production area, customers, and transportation costs are regarded as the most important factors in deciding the location of logistics centers. In addition, among the three locations considered, the northeast provinces of Ho Chi Minh City were the best location for logistic centers, followed by North Hanoi and Da Nang city. The findings of this study make a significant contribution to both academic and practical aspects of locating logistic centers.}

The continuous growth in world trade depends on the efficiency of trade support structures such as the logistics services. Despite logistics integral role in supporting commercial activities, there has generally been a low level of analysis and trade policy research focus from trade practitioners. This paper explores the effect of logistics performance in international trade. The analysis draws on overall logistics performance as well as disaggregated measures of logistics specificities data for a large sample of countries. The empirical analysis involved the estimation of standard export and import equations incorporating measures of logistics performance. The findings show that the overall logistics performance is positively and statistically significantly correlated with exports and imports. The analysis is also extended by investigating if logistics specificities mattered for international trade. The findings reveal that several dimensions capturing logistics performance have statistically significant and positive effect, mostly on exports. The main policy implication is that continuous investment in logistics infrastructure and services can positively impact international trade.}

Owing to industrial tradition and well-developed transport infrastructure, including primarily the most densely built network of high-class roads in the country and fast road connections with central Poland as well as neighboring countries, the territory of Silesian Province has become an important warehousing market of all-Polish and Central-Eastern European relevance. Identifying the trends observed in the development of freight transport logistics within the territory in question is the first step towards improvement of the current state of matters. It also provided grounds to perform one of tasks defined under the international S-mile project implemented within the framework of the ERANET Transport III “Sustainable Logistics and Supply Chain” programme. This article is mainly an attempt to review results of the analyses undertaken in this scope, including those pertaining to the specificity of the existing infrastructure and the projected development of the logistic infrastructure in Silesian Province along with orientations of its development proposed in strategic documents of both national and regional level, such as the Silesian Province development strategy, development plans, concepts, forecasts as well as projects concerning transport and freight transport logistics. Some results of accessibility analysis of the logistics centres currently operating in Silesian Province have also been presented.}

The World Bank Logistics Performance Index (LPI) has produced the benchmark for more than 100 countries covering six main components that are related to the trade facilitation in the context of the logistics supply chain. However, the output of the index is based on logistics service providers, thus measuring the performance from the perspective of users, which does not only serve as a comparison study, but also remains as the ultimate study to prove the friendliness of logistics and trade facilitation involved in import and export processes. In the present work, six (6) components were used to assess logistics performance including environmental friendly. Results revealed that trade friendliness by the logistics services is improved and requires further analysis, according to the central hub of each sector in Malaysia. It attracts future development for the manufacturing industry by having excellent logistics services facilities.}

Product sellers nowadays cannot sustain themselves in the competitive market only from greening the manufacturing processes, but all parties across the supply chain are also driven to be ‘green’, even logistics service providers (LSPs). This study aims to provide insights into the initiation of green policies within logistics companies by investigating the significant factors that influence the adoption of green practices, along with the ranking orders of several green activities in terms of their contributions to two corporate goals: cost reduction and environmental protection. The results were based upon a questionnaire-based survey on 311 LSPs in Thailand. Interviews with industry experts were also employed to supplement the questionnaire data. Thailand, as one of Asia's manufacturing hubs, represents developing countries distributing products worldwide, and its logistics industry is growing rapidly. The results indicate that ‘eco-driving’ and ‘vehicle routing’ activities are more acknowledged and commonly conducted across the industry. The contributions of ‘alternative energy’ and ‘modal shift’ are also highly recognised by the practitioners, but a number of concerns still obstruct the implementation of these approaches. In terms of the antecedent factors, ‘company size’, ‘financial status’, ‘service areas’, ‘pressure from customers’, and ‘organisational support’ appear to be statistically significant for the level of green logistics implementation. The findings make a contribution to strategic decision making for LSPs who need to improve their environmental performance by initiating green projects.}

In logistics service innovation, external relationships are important sources of resources and knowledge. Drawing on social capital theory and the strategy-structure-performance paradigm, this study proposes that guanxi (Chinese system of social networks and relationships that facilitates business and other dealings), expedites logistics service innovation by 3PL providers in China. This study also proposes that the effect of guanxi on logistics service innovation is contingent on the alignment between the type of guanxi and the provider’s organizational structure. We tested our proposed model using survey data from 165 3PL providers in China. Our findings suggest that both political and business guanxi have a positive effect on logistics service innovation; however, those types of guanxi should be used in consideration of the firm’s organizational structure. The results suggest that with respect to logistics service innovation, political guanxi is more effective for 3PL providers whose organizational structure is highly centralized or has low formalization. The converse applies to business guanxi.}

abstract = {Cloud manufacturing is a service-oriented and networked manufacturing model in which manufacturing resources are provided to demanders in the manner of manufacturing services through the cloud manufacturing platform. The optimal selection problem of manufacturing services plays an important role in searching the optimal manufacturing services for specific tasks. As a special type of manufacturing services in cloud manufacturing, logistics services provide transport services for different service providers and customers. The optimal selection of logistics services is important for guaranteeing just-in-time delivery of products to service demanders. In this paper, the characteristics of logistics service selection (LSS) problem are analyzed and a mathematical model is built in terms of optimization objective, an example and general solutions. Besides, some simulations are conducted to verify the proposed LSS model. Results show that the average task delivery time obtained by the proposed model is shorter than the fastest strategy and the nearest strategy in the cloud manufacturing environment.}

abstract = {The location of logistics facilities significantly affects not only the activities of urban goods movement, but also the urban environment as these facilities represent major originators and receivers of freight. Recently, the phenomenon of logistics sprawl, i.e. the relocation of logistics facilities away from inner urban areas to suburban areas has received an increasing level of attention from both academics and policy makers. In this paper, a literature review of the various impacts of logistics sprawl is provided with a detailed taxonomy of the impacts. It has been observed that logistics sprawl contributed changes in geography of urban freight, increasing trucks' travelled distance and consequent emissions and impacting the commuting of logistics employment. The paper presents a summary of the empirical findings illustrating the additional distance trucks travel due to logistics sprawl in several European and North American cities. Furthermore, the paper provides an overview of the measures and policies implemented in various metropolitan areas to reintegrate small-scale logistics facilities within inner urban areas to act as consolidation centres.}
