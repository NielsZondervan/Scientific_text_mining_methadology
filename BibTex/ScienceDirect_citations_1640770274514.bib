abstract = {As the concept of sustainability and its evolution has already been discussed, this chapter will focus attention on its application in one of the organization’s processes that has more influence on resource management, namely, the supply chain. In this sense, we will discuss the different methods and practices that allow firms of today to manage their resources in a more sustainable way, minimizing waste and contributing to the welfare of the planet. For this purpose, we will study in depth the concept of Sustainable Supply Chain Management, distinguishing it from the research avenue of Green Supply Chain Management. With the aim of managing firms’ operations sustainably, various practices that appear to be useful for businesses will be analyzed: Design for Sustainability, Eco-efficiency, Eco-Design, Green Purchasing, Reverse Logistics, and Investment Recovery. In addition, various tools also exist for assessing the sustainable impact of the activities within the supply chain, such as Life Cycle Assessment and Environmental Labeling, which deserve attention too.}

abstract = {Order picking has often been described as one of the most labor- and time-consuming internal logistics processes. In manual picker-to-parts order picking systems, order pickers often spend a significant amount of time on travelling through the warehouse to reach storage positions where required items are stored. To reduce the cost of order picking, researchers have developed various optimal and heuristic routing policies in the past. This paper presents the results of a systematic review of research on order picker routing. First, it identifies order picker routing policies in a systematic search of the literature and then develops a conceptual framework for categorizing the various policies. Order picker routing policies identified during the literature search are then descriptively analyzed and discussed in light of the developed framework. The paper also derives insights into the frequencies of usage of the different routing policies available in the literature and applies a citation analysis to identify seminal works that shaped the literature on order picker routing. The paper concludes with an outlook on future research opportunities.}

Existing researches focus on the collaborative transportation on the flat ground, but usually neglect the obstacle-crossing problems in real-world environments. This paper designs a novel multi-robotsystem composed of tracked mobile robots used for collaborative transportation and investigatesits stairs climbing process. The robots are combined with each other by a parallel manipulator which is implemented to carry payloads. Meanwhile, actuated by the robots, the manipulator could achieve a 6 degrees of freedom configuration. A cable-driven unit is designed to provide extratension among these robots to improve the climbing capability. The statics model of the stair climbing process of a monorobot is analyzed. The climbing orientation of the robot is optimized and the stair climbing capabilityis improved by changing the climbing yaw angle. Based on the optimized mono robotclimbing process, the stair climbing formations of the multi-robot system are analyzed and the formationparameters are optimized with the maximal support angle.The climbing strategy is proposed according to the mass of payload and the height of the stair. The effectiveness of the climbing strategy is validated by the stair climbing experiments.}

abstract = {The production routing problem (PRP) merges the lot-sizing problem and the vehicle routing problem, two classical problems that have been the focus of comprehensive studies for over half a century. Solving the PRP is an effort to optimize decisions about the production, inventory, distribution, and routing in an integrated manner. In the literature of the recent decade, due to economic changes and regulatory issues, reverse logistics has become a focal point. Subsequently, the vehicle routing problem with simultaneous pickup and delivery (VRPSPD) has drawn more and more attention for its considerable effect on the reverse logistics problem. In addition, one of the major arguments in supply chain management is uncertainty of demand, which it is highly crucial to make accurate decisions. Most of the previous studies have disregarded the concept of uncertainty and reverse flow in the PRP. In this study, we present a mixed integer linear programming model (MILP) for the production-inventory-routing problem with simultaneous pickup and delivery, while considering a reverse flow of products. To reduce the total cost of the system, the proposed model plans the decisions with respect to production–reproduction setups, quantities of the production–reproduction, visiting/not-visiting the retailers, supplier inventory management, retail inventory management under the vendor-managed inventory (VMI) policy, the quantity of the defect-free products delivered to retailers and that of the defective products collected from them at the same time, and vehicle routing in each period. We also propose a new robust MILP formulation for the problem, while considering multiple uncertainty conditions, including the quantity of each retailer’s demand, the quantity of the defective products collected from each retailer in each period, and the reproduction cost. Presenting the mentioned problem with a robust optimization approach which applies to equality constraints is the main contribution of this research. The performance of the model under uncertainty was depicted based on comparison between deterministic and robust model considering various random examples. Given the NP-hardness of the problem and to evaluate the performance of various algorithms in solving the model, we develop two meta-heuristic algorithms, viz. the simulated annealing algorithm and genetic algorithm. The performances of the proposed algorithms are analyzed and compared based on the numerical examples in three small, medium, and large sizes which for each size three states, including standard, high transportation cost, and high inventory cost are considered.}

Palliative radiation therapy, along with other systemic and surgical measures, has the potential to significantly improve the quality of life of such patients. There is little high-level evidence and a lack of consensus to direct the selection of an optimal palliative radiation regimen. An ideal palliative radiation regimen should alleviate symptoms secondary to the cancer with minimal treatment toxicity and side effects while improving a patient's quality of life. This review presents the treatment approaches, outcomes, and toxicities associated with different radiation regimens and proposes a multidisciplinary framework for the selection of an individualized treatment regimen for patients that centers around patient prognosis, goals of care, logistics of treatment, and the availability of other surgical and systemic therapies.}

First, various stages of poverty eradication in China were identified, and the development of poverty eradication was reviewed to demonstrate the achievements and significant contribution to global poverty eradication. Second, using demographic information, the geographical distribution of rural and impoverished populations were analyzed to validate the positive correlation between them. Through the targeting process, significant geographical disparities of impoverished areas in China were clearly revealed, and the impoverished population was further identified. Third, the natural solar energy endowment was thoroughly analyzed to assess the applicability of solar photovoltaics in various areas. Policy development and the anticipated benefits of solar photovoltaic projects for poverty alleviation (PVPPA) were described and evaluated. Finally, China's experiences with PVPPA were discussed. The results indicate that there are some problems associated with the implementation of PVPPA regarding the policy and management schemes, technical support and logistics, and financial resources and assurance. Recommendations to overcome these problems are also discussed. China's PVPPA program introduced here provides valuable insights regarding poverty alleviation, especially regarding the targeting process, participatory development, and profit sharing, and may thus benefit societies worldwide.}

This research proposes a framework for modeling and forecasting export sales using Genetic Programming, which is an artificial intelligence technique derived from the model of biological evolution. Analyzing an empirical case of an export company, an export sales forecasting model is suggested.

Therefore, it is a frequently used building material for masonry units, prefabricated reinforced components and lightweight mineral insulation boards with increasing popularity. Post-demolition AAC is currently mainly disposed of in landfills. Decreasing landfill capacities, the legal framework, and protection of primary resources require developing recycling options for AAC. However, so far, no overall recycling of post-demolition AAC has been established yet. Only AAC primary process waste is recirculated or discharged, for example as an absorbent for chemicals or animal bedding. For high-quality post-demolition AAC recycling, only minimal information about recyclable volumes and their regional distribution is available. Therefore, a new dynamic retrospective and prospective AAC quantification model on a national level using AAC production, construction activity, AAC popularity, and buildings’ lifetimes is developed to assess geographically distributed current and future post-demolition AAC volumes. This new model is applied to quantify post-demolition AAC volumes in a case study for Germany in the period between 1950 and 2050. For validation, the results are compared with two different approaches and with data from the literature. The AAC quantification allows decision support for the circular management of AAC during its life cycle and along its value/supply chain regarding design, location planning, logistics, production, and recycling.}

A unified approach consisting of fuzzy group decision-making, fuzzy evidential reasoning approach, and expected utility concept is utilized to assess critical success factors of SFT based on four competitive priorities. The applicability of the developed model is exhibited through a case example, and sensitivity analysis is also performed to examine its robustness.

First, we discuss the novel concept of circular time, and material separation of C-Si PV materials is discussed by theoretically introducing a novel framework. Then, we recreate a numerical simulation experiment to evaluate the performance of the proposed theoretical model of a CLMC to assess the flow of silicon used in C-Si PV, aiding in future planning and logistics for a CE in the PV industry. The preliminary results obtained in the simulation show that it is not possible to close the material flow without introducing new raw material into the system, unless the operational lifespan of the PV panels is reduced. This research seeks to fill a gap in CE theoretical literature by introducing a new framework and identifying some of the challenges and limits of implementing a CE system in the form of a CLMC system based on C2C principles (C2C-CLMC).}

This study investigates MPP management and facilitates the adoption of sustainability practices in the humanitarian medical supply chain. The study identifies 20 potential barriers for sustainability and categorises them into six different issues (material, operational, logistics, human, funding, and exogenous). Fuzzy best-worst method and analytic network process methodologies were adopted to prioritise barriers according to their degree of influence. Findings from the study suggest that stakeholders should focus attention on the material, operations, and logistical issues. Poor compliance with the World Health Organisation guidelines is reported as the most significant barrier to sustainability. Long-term collaboration and promotion of cash-based donation are suggested as suitable alternatives to product donation. The key recommendations of the study are to sensitise donors and media regarding donation practices and disaster relief victim requirements, build local capacity, design coordination mechanisms, and develop a performance measurement system incorporating the triple bottom line of sustainability. The study outcome reveals connections between barriers to sustainability and sheds light on the socioenvironmental aspect of donations. The study lays a foundation for future research, exploring how to better enable sustainability in the relief supply chain.}

Hence, this research investigates the disaster waste management problem by simultaneous consideration of sustainability and resiliency. In this regard, a multi-objective mathematical model is presented to minimize total costs, environmental impacts, and transportation risks while maximizing social impacts and resilience of the logistics system. Since uncertainty is an integral part of disaster conditions, the research problem formulates the fuzzy robust stochastic optimization model under the hybrid uncertainty. Then, a real-world case study is studied in Golestan province, Iran. Afterward, transportation risks are calculated by adopting the fuzzy failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) method, and then the proposed model is solved by a hybrid algorithm based on the multi-choice goal programming method and particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO). Eventually, sensitivity analyses on some important model parameters are conducted, and practical managerial/theoretical implications are presented.

We introduce a network design model considering the location and re-location decisions of mobile hospitals using a two-stage stochastic programming model with various disaster scenarios. This problem addresses critical transportation and logistics decisions of governments and relief organizations in designing health care networks for disaster preparedness. We apply our models to a real life case study for an expected earthquake in Istanbul and extract several managerial insights. Numerical experiments demonstrate that mobile hospitals can provide significant improvements in healthcare service.}

Thus, little effort has been made to quantify the impact of flow composition variables as crash precursors. We analyze the advantages of having access to this data by analyzing two scenarios, namely, with aggregated and disaggregated data. For each case, we build Logistics Regressions and Support Vector Machines models to predict accidents in a major urban expressway in Santiago, Chile. Our results show that having access to disaggregated data by vehicle type increases the prediction power up to 30 % providing, at the same time, much better intuition about the actual traffic conditions that may lead to accidents. These results may be useful when evaluating technology investments and developments in urban freeways.}

Because of difficulties in logistics, studies focusing on deep-sea benthic systems often have limited sample sets that may be far apart in space. Here, we present analyses based on a well-sampled region, the northwest Atlantic, allowing us to relate patterns of polychaete community structure (using taxonomic families and feeding guilds) against well-resolved environmental gradients. We show that community structure is heterogenous in this area. We observe three major groups within polychaete communities which also show differences in feeding guilds. Several environmental gradients, including long-term variables, explained the differences between the groups. Both energetics and habitat structure variables were important, while past fishing intensity had a weak effect, although there was support for a difference in community composition for communities above and below the historical fishing limit of 1200 m. The effect of long-term environmental factors may indicate that the deep sea is not immune to climate change, and these effects must continue to be considered in future management of exploitation of this ecosystem.}

This increasingly implies having a stable and optimized production process, always with a view to continuous improvement. Therefore, it is very important to be aware of all the waste that is generated in all production and logistics operations and take action to reduce them. In this regard and considering the process of producing air conditioning pipes for the automotive industry, a high scrap value was detected mainly due to soldering process. Therefore, the entire production process is analyzed in order to identify the main causes behind the high scrap value. Several Lean and quality tools are used to reduce not only the amount of scrap but also to increase the line productivity. In order to face this challenge, after elaborating the action plan and corresponding implementation, the scrap value is reduced by 12% in general, and productivity increased by 29%, 55% and 22.5% in three different references produced by the same machine. Although this solution is a bit expensive, the corresponding payback is reduced, so it can easily be applied transversally to other similar machines allowing extremely interesting gains in the short term.}

A questionnaire, consisting of Likert-scales and open-ended questions was used to collect data during October 2018. Preceptors were committed to their role. Correlations were found between preceptors’ perceptions of benefits or rewards and commitment to the role (p = 0.003, r2 = 0.39) and perceptions of support and commitment to the role (p = .001, r2 = 0.46). Altruistic benefits were perceived to be of the greatest importance. Participants who recognised the importance of preceptorship for the organisation were more likely to be committed to the role. Eighty-three percent of respondents reported a lack of consistency in allocation to work with their preceptee. Qualitative results elucidated themes of helping, personal professional development, the opportunity to teach, and organisational improvement. Supports as barriers and enablers to successful preceptorship were discussed in terms of peer and leadership support, role preparation, the logistics of the environment, role conflict, and consistency of allocation to work in a preceptorship dyad. Commitment to the preceptor role may be increased by highlighting organisational benefits of preceptorship, increasing consistency of contact between preceptorship dyads, and increasing access to supports and preparation.}

In the era of the Industrial Revolution 4.0, various society aspects and industrial processes are digitally connected to increase productivity, especially for COVID-19 treatment and logistic handling. This research was conducted to analyze several proposed monohull-unmanned ship prototypes which are expected to be a proposed solution to assist COVID-19 countermeasure. A series of stability and motion analyses is conducted, then the results are assessed to conclude the best design among the proposed design options. Results of the study indicated that compared to three variations of hull types, design of the Model III has excellent characterisics of ship stability, hull resistance and seakeeping. These analysis parameters are considered as main criteria in the ship’s requirements since patient and logistic have to be transported safely to the designated location according to the given mission in assisting COVID-19 handling and treatment.}

abstract = {The vehicle routing problem with an incompatible loading constraint and splitting deliveries by order is an extension of the well-known capacitated vehicle routing problem. Some orders cannot be transported alongside others due to some type of products in them or their special requirements on transportation condition. Additionally, splitting delivery by order is an effective method for enhancing vehicle efficiency since a customer might have many orders, and order is a set of compatible products. However, split delivery inevitably creates order receipt complexities and contributes to the significant complications of the problem in terms of formulating not only the model, but also the solution method. This study examines an innovative vehicle routing problem characterized by splitting deliveries by order, and addresses the inconvenience of order receipts and incompatibility among orders when fulfilling practical logistics requirements. We formulate this problem as an integer programming model, and the goal is to minimize the sum of routing cost and receipt cost. Then, two hybrid heuristic algorithms called MCWS-LS and S-ALNS are proposed to solve this problem. Furthermore, we conduct a series of experiments over existing vehicle routing problem instances, as well as analyze them under a realistic background to evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithms.}

abstract = {In the fields such as computer science, intelligent transport systems and logistics scheduling, many problems can be reflected as the variants of traveling salesman problem (TSP). In recent years, although there are many achievements and developments on the study of intelligent optimization algorithms for TSP and its variants, the challenge and problem are still existed: while the scale of problem is large, there is the dimension disaster problem; the optimization algorithms for TSP variants are easy to fall into the local optimum. Multiple balanced traveling salesmen problem (MBTSP) is a variant of TSP, it can be used in the fields such as optimizing multiple gas turbine engines. Since MBTSP is NP-hard problem, many intelligent optimization algorithms, such as genetic algorithm and ITÖ algorithm, have been used to solve it. However, while the scale of MBTSP is large, the traditional algorithms are easy to fall into local optimum. Aiming at the problem, this paper extends the scale of MBTSP to large scale scenes, and proposes a novel ITÖ algorithm (NITÖ) based on crossover operator and local search for large scale MBTSP. For NITÖ algorithm, the drift operator and volatility operator of ITÖ algorithm are redesigned, which are carried out by improved crossover operator and local search. The extensive experiments show that NITÖ can demonstrate better solution quality than the compared state-of-the-art algorithms.}

The causes of this phenomenon largely depend on the human factor, i.e. irrational actions of personnel who inefficiently use digital technology. The prerequisites for such actions are low competencies of employees, unfair attitude to work, sabotage. Accordingly, this leads to deviations in the transportation process, which can lead to violations of the conditions for the transportation of goods. From the point of view of the concept of reliability of road freight transport, this can be defined as a failure. Failures caused by the varied actions of managers when working with the Transportation Management System were extremely difficult to diagnose. Direct monitoring of managers during the working day is often fraught with various organizational difficulties, and is difficult to implement for a long time to identify ineffective staff activities. The concept of Process Mining, which has been known among scientists and researchers of information systems for more than 10 years, is currently of great interest in business. The paper examined the issues of improving and reorganizing the activities of managers of a transport company based on the mining of the TMS Autobase event log. Based on the results of the study, recommendations were made aimed at developing the digitalization of the transportation process, suggesting an increase in transportation reliability.}

Logistics estimations based on a sample of 48 Portuguese companies suggest that, considered globally, formal IPR protection is detrimental to the companies’ competitiveness. Notwithstanding, when IPR protection mechanisms are discriminated by type, the results indicate that the use of informal protection mechanisms, such as lead time and trade secrets, fosters the companies’ competitiveness, whereas the use of formal protection mechanisms, in particular, patents, trademarks and geographical indications, negatively impacts on competitiveness.

With the increasing concerns on the environment friendly supply chain by the general public, we construct two remanufacturing models dominated by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and the independent remanufacturer (IR) based on the auto parts market which provides new products, remanufactured products and refurbished products. Considering the remanufacturing subsidy and the market environment parameters, we analyze the full-remanufacturing and partial-remanufacturing using the Stackelberg and Cournot duopoly game models. We then obtain the equilibrium strategies for each of these scenarios. We further carry out sensitivity analysis for the two remanufacturing models and investigate the impact of the remanufacturing subsidy on these two models. The findings in this paper enable us to compare the remanufacturing modes and show how the equilibrium outcome depends on the key model parameters. In the comparison and numerical analysis, they are revealed that (i) the improvement on the quality level of the refurbished products is always unfavorable to the quality level and the production quantity of both the new and the remanufactured products, especially in the OEM remanufacturing model; (ii) subsidy is ineffective in the IR remanufacturing mode when the remanufacturing cost is low; (iii) the IR remanufacturing outperforms the OEM remanufacturing in both economic benefits and social welfare, when the cost of remanufacturing and the customer willingness to pay for remanufacturing products are low, and the quality of refurbished products is high. These findings have potential implications for enterprise remanufacturing production and government policy-making in complex market environments.}

An improved hybrid NSGA-II is then developed to solve the proposed model. Two initial solution methods are employed: clustering for the leader and a Clarke and Wright method for the follower. Non-dominated sorting and best-cost route crossover operator are used to improve the effectiveness of NSGA-II. Based on Prins (24 instances) and Barreto (13 instances) benchmarks, the experimental results indicated that the improved operator had strong competitiveness and a better performance than previous methods, with the improved algorithm achieving the best average gaps of 0.18% and 0.24% and improving the best-known solutions in some instances. The model and solution methodology are illustrated using a waste collection problem in Tianjin, from which practical insights are derived.}

The objective of this study was to explore how Community Psychiatric Nurses experienced stigma in their line of duty.
Methods
The study adopted qualitative exploratory descriptive design. Participants were selected from three district hospitals (Ga South, Ga Central and Okaikoi) all in the Accra Metropolis. Twelve (12) participants between the ages of 26 and 40 were selected using a purposive sampling technique. After transcribing verbatim audio-taped individual interviews, the data were analysed using content analysis procedures.
Results
Five (5) themes emerged including: Mocking and labelling, discrimination, expression of genuine concern about their safety, poor image and associative stigma. Mostly, the community psychiatric nurses felt ridiculed and belittled as they experienced open negative labelling in the community.
Conclusions
The findings draws attention for the need for all Community Psychiatric Nurses to be respected and not ridiculed so they can work effectively and ensure decentralization of care. Stigma can be reduced through extensive education using various media outlets. Adequate logistics is necessary to enhance the work of community psychiatry nurses.}

This leads to inefficiency due to additional, partially not required workload and high scrap rates. Further, there is a lack of knowledge about the effects of the respective repair measures on the performance of the parts. So far, there are no autonomous repair solutions that allow an optimal and individually tailored regeneration. In order to realize such a process, it is necessary to bring together the manufacturing, function-simulating and logistics-oriented disciplines in an integrated system. For this, data management along the process chain is an important success factor. In particular, the provision and linking of the data and data formats required for simulation and the production environment is of fundamental importance. This paper presents a data architecture that can serve as a framework for data integration within a representative process chain for regeneration.}

Motivated by a real-life case study, this paper focuses on developing a simulation algorithm that assists same-day package delivery companies to serve customers instantly. The proposed recommender system provides the best solution with respect to three criteria: cost, time, and sustainability, considering the variation in travel time and cost parameters. The decision support tool provides recommendations on the best alternative for transporting products based on factors, such as source and destination locations, time of the day, package weight, and volume. Besides considering existing new technologies like electric-assisted cargo bikes, we also analyze the impact of emerging methods of deliveries, such as robots and air taxis. Finally, this paper also considers the best delivery alternative during the presence of a pandemic, such as COVID-19. For the purpose of illustrating our approach, we consider the delivery options in New York City.

The IoT networks generate enormous data comprising meteorological information, patient critical body parameters, finance, logistics, location of a tracking object, etc. Security for sensitive data,such as patient body critical parameters from an attached monitoring device, streaming over IoT networks is vital and is a need of the hour. Data integrity and user (or device) authentication are crucial for building a trust-worthy communication network among the peers in IoT networks. Most networks still employ specific software encryption algorithms that provide considerable data security. But quantum computing has proved the vulnerability of computationally vigorous cryptographic algorithms. A decentralized and scalable framework for device authentication and data security is proposed in this paper based on blockchain platform and Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs). An authentication protocol is developed using PUF-based cryptographic primitives. The PUF-based keys are hard to replicate and almost impossible to predict because of the randomness in the physical design and complex mathematical modeling of the system. Lightweight Smart contracts are used to facilitate role-based access control. Data privacy is preserved by storing the sensitive data off-chain. As a proof of concept, an IoT-based healthcare system based on Ethereum permissioned blockchain is developed using the proposed framework. The​ designed PUF exhibits 48.46% uniqueness and 2.38% reliability. A comparative analysis with existing similar models shows that the proposed approach is feasible and provides a scalable solution for device authentication and data security in resource-limited medical IoT networks.}

Introducing occasional drivers in the context of freight transportation can represent a valuable option. This paper is concerned with reinforcing the distribution capability of a real-life company by using the novel paradigm of crowdshipping, besides employing its fleet of vehicles. Crowdshipping consists involving occasional drivers, which are to be selected from the public through the use of the combinatorial auction paradigm. We propose a mathematical model that integrates the decisions related to the vehicle routing with the winner determination problem for the occasional drivers’ selection. The objective is to minimize the overall transportation cost of using the company’s available fleet plus the cost of employing external drivers. We also propose two heuristic methods to solve real-life distribution instances; one is based on the decomposition method and the other on a cost-comparison greedy approach. The validity of the model, as well as the heuristic methods, has been verified by solving a real case study related to an online bookstore with door-to-door delivery in Oman. Our computational results show savings that reach 30% with respect to the solution implemented by the company.}

In current study, we developed a novel water-based phase change coolant (PCC), which showed longer effectiveness in maintaining low temperature condition compared with ice, and applied in preserving the postharvest mushrooms. The results showed that the novel PCC effectively inhibited water loss, as well as maintained quality attributes including firmness, color, phenolics, flavonoids, and thus prolonged the shelf-life of mushrooms. Low temperature condition created by the novel PCC treatment maintained high level of energy charge by activating the activities of SDH, CCO, H+-ATPase and Ca2+-ATPase, resulting in the delay of postharvest senescence. In addition, sufficient energy supply decreased the consumption of glutamate as carbon skeleton by inhibiting GDH activity, improved glutamate accumulation, and therefore maintained sensory properties as a result. Thus, the novel PCC might be an excellent substitute for ice in cold chain transportation of mushrooms.}

Even low-risk routine surgical procedures are associated with morbidity, mounting health care costs, and patient anxiety. Recent advancements in noninvasive diagnostic modalities have helped improve diagnostic accuracy, especially when managing melanocytic lesions of uncertain diagnosis. Breakthroughs in artificial intelligence have also shown exciting potential in changing the landscape of melanoma detection. In the first article in this continuing medical education series, we review novel diagnostic technologies, such as automated 2- and 3-dimensional total body imaging with sequential digital dermoscopic imaging, reflectance confocal microscopy, and electrical impedance spectroscopy, and we explore the logistics and implications of potentially integrating artificial intelligence into existing melanoma management paradigms.}

Sleep deprivation is a common problem in Canada and is associated with many health problems. More than a quarter of Canadians get fewer than the recommended sleep hours (<7 h). This paper examines the prevalence and risk factors for sleep deprivation in two First Nation communities in Saskatchewan, Canada.
Methods
The baseline cross-sectional survey was completed between 2018 and 2019 in collaboration with the two Cree First Nation communities in Saskatchewan, Canada. There were five hundred and eighty-eight participants participated in the survey from two communities. A Multivariate logistic regression model was used for analysis.
Results
The prevalence of sleep deprivation (<7 h of sleep) was 25.4%. The multivariate logistics regression revealed that middle and older age groups, visible mold in the house, and being male with nighttime insomnia symptoms were significantly associated with a higher risk of sleep deprivation among study participants in the study.
Conclusions
In these two First Nation communities, a higher proportion of the participants reported having sleep deprivation. This was a unique study, which evolved from ongoing research collaboration with two First Nation communities in Saskatchewan, Canada. Findings will be helpful in the management of patients with sleep deprivation in these communities; as well as for co-creating policy with the communities and future research priorities.}

We also explore the logistics of making house calls part of pulmonary practice, including supplies needed, safety in the home, and reimbursement. Reimbursement has grown for house calls, and we review how to bill for visits, advance care planning, and care management that is often required when caring for patients with advanced illness. In addition, house calls can often be beneficial for patients who may be identified as high risk and are part of value-based agreements with payers.}

The objective is to investigate trekkers' changing demographics, travel patterns and experience of illness in the Annapurna region.
Study design
A mixed method study comprising a cross-sectional survey was carried out with trekkers who had completed trekking in the Annapurna region.
Methods
Interviews were carried out with trekkers using a standardised questionnaire from September to December (main trekking season) 2014 and 2016. The interview format included trekkers' demographic characteristics, travel patterns, preparation and logistics and experiences of illness and treatment.
Results
The demographic composition of trekkers had changed. Chinese and Nepalese trekkers were the most dominant groups along with other international trekkers from 16 different countries. In terms of the trekking pattern, the Chinese and the Nepalese trekkers spent a median of 7 days each in the trek and trekked to a median altitude of 3500 m, while other international trekkers spent a median of 10 days and trekked to a median altitude of 4000 m. In general, trekkers' food habits and travel patterns were good. They undertook some health preparation by using the Internet, consulting friends and travel guidebooks and consulting a doctor, pharmacist and other healthcare providers and brought medicines accordingly. However, 25% of trekkers, most commonly Chinese, Korean and Nepalese, came without any health preparation and with no medicines. Thirty percent of the trekkers became sick during the trek with common illnesses such as diarrhoea, vomiting, the common cold, headache, fever and altitude-related symptoms.
Conclusions
Trekkers' demographic composition has changed from that found in previous studies, and this was reflected in their trekking pattern. Trekkers' health preparations for high-altitude trekking were still inadequate, especially among the newer groups such as the Nepalese, Chinese and Korean trekkers. Issues such as trekkers' health preparation and practice, eating patterns, the length of trek and altitude and health and safety provision need further improvement, especially in the context of these changing trekker demographics.}

abstract = {In the current business landscape, customers’ orders compliance with the established delivery dates and the efficient use of resources are two relevant topics on the agenda. In this context, order fulfilment (OF) is a key business process dealing with all the activities needed to define customer requirements, design the production and logistics processes, and fill customer orders. In this paper, a case study developed in a ceramic company is presented. Its aim was to analyse and improve the company order fulfilment process that had been deteriorating after the introduction of a new product line that implied a new production process. Due to the change in the usual paradigm, there were several challenges that hindered customer service. The DMAIC cycle was applied. At the end of the study an improvement in the process capacity, as well as a 30% reduction in the percentage of delayed orders was achieved, amongst other improvements.}

La simulation interprofessionnelle est une technique pédagogique efficace pour développer les compétences non-techniques en soins critiques et renforcer la collaboration interprofessionnelle des équipes afin d’améliorer la qualité des soins et le devenir du patient. L’implémentation de la simulation interprofessionnelle en formation initiale et continue est facilitée par un « réfèrent simulation » dans chaque discipline/profession afin de motiver, planifier et coordonner les équipes. Il est essentiel lors d’une simulation interprofessionnelle de considérer les aspects sociologiques (hiérarchie, pouvoir, autorité, conflits interprofessionnels, genre, accès à l’information, identité professionnelle) qui peuvent affecter la communication interprofessionnelle et le travail d’équipe mais également les processus d’apprentissage. Des outils d’évaluation spécifique du travail d’équipe lors des formations par simulation interprofessionnelle doivent être utilisés pour aider à structurer le débriefing et améliorer la performance des équipes. Le lieux de la simulation interprofessionnelle (in-situ ou intra-centre) doit servir les objectifs pédagogiques tout en intégrant la disponibilité de l’équipe et des locaux de l’unité de soins.
Key points
Interprofessional simulation-based education is effective for learning non-technical critical care skills and strengthening interprofessional team collaboration to optimize quality of care and patient outcome. Implementation of interprofessional simulation sessions in initial and continuing education is facilitated by a team of “champions” from each discipline/profession to ensure educational quality and logistics. Interprofessional simulation training must be integrated into a broader interprofessional curriculum supported by managers, administrators and clinical colleagues from different professional programs. When conducting interprofessional simulation training, it is essential to account for sociological factors (hierarchy, power, authority, interprofessional conflicts, gender, access to information, professional identity) both in scenario design and debriefing. Teamwork assessment tools in interprofessional simulation training may be used to guide debriefing. The interprofessional simulation setting (in-situ or simulation centre) will be chosen according to the learning objectives and the logistics.}

In this paper, to satisfy the intricate limits involved in real vehicle routing problem, the study has been structured considering different types of vehicles in terms of maximum capacity, velocity and emissions, asymmetric paths, vehicle-client constraints and delivery time windows. The firefly algorithm has been implemented to solve the vehicle routing problem and the TOPSIS technique has been applied to integrate economic and environmental factors. Finally, to prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a numerical example has been proposed using data provided by a logistic company located in Sicily.}

In this perspective, a debated subject is the interfacing of hardware, because logistic challenges and production assets are moving towards the adoption of Internet-of-Things-based Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), whose flexibility allows to rethink control architectures that are traditionally based on ISA 95 and IEC 62264 formalized hierarchies. More versatile architectures also pave the way to the so-called horizontal integration. This work focuses on intra-logistics, aiming at defining a simple architecture enabling CPS assets’ monitoring and control. This allows the development of an open platform that enables an easy and simultaneous connection of multi-vendor hardware, overcoming the current legacy systems’ gap of requiring a significant effort to do so. The architecture is then substantiated by the development of a component interfacing Automated Guided Vehicles (AGV) and managing their navigation thanks to a Fleet Management System (FMS), which is back fed by the same AGVs.}

The proposed system consists of couriers working with AMLs that visit the couriers in the field and transfer parcels between the couriers and the depot. Couriers can continue their tours without having to make repeated returns to the depot. At the same time, the AMLs can enlarge the coverage of each depot and allow a reduction in the number of depots, saving on rent. We propose a mixed integer programming model to solve the AML-Courier 2-Echelon Location Routing Problem in order to determine the tours of AMLs and couriers. We adapt and modify a hybrid Clark and Wright heuristic, the performance of which is examined for larger problem sizes, and introduce an enhanced version to improve the routes constructed. The results show the efficiency of the proposed heuristics for large problem sizes in terms of solution quality and execution time. Finally, the sensitivity of the best found solutions to some important parameters is analysed and a comparison with a single-echelon model made to establish the benefit of AML use.}

The life cycle consists of a sequence of stages. The leading success factor of any scenario is the support of the scenario during all stages of its life cycle. The most important stages of the scenario life cycle are the following: the stage of forming the event set for generating the scenario, the stage of performing the sequence of scenario events and the stage of situational analysis of the external and internal environment of the event. In the article it is proposed to use a theoretical set model in order to select an element from a set of alternatives. The elements are events for designing a scenario. The model uses fuzzy logic and is based on the process of controlling an array of parameters if variants are available. The model is used to support the stage of forming a set of events for generating the scenario. The mathematical model of automated system operation which is used to support the stage of performing the sequence of scenario events is suggested in the article. The model is based on the principle of information logistics: each parameter (a set of data) is in the right place in the automated system, ‘just-in-time’ and in the required format. A modified frame model is proposed to support situational analysis. Situational analysis is used to operate the event algorithms and to determine the next event in the scenario. The modified frame model is based on the use of fuzzy logic procedures in a frame network.}

Food is a valuable commodity that not only quickly transforms to waste but also adversely impacts the environment. It leads to loss of labour hours, futile resources, unfed lives, lost profits and an increase in environmental hazards. With this backdrop, the present study aims to identify the key enablers which are crucial in diminishing the inefficiencies across the entire food supply chain. Interpretive structural modelling and matrix of cross-impact multiplications applied to classification techniques are used to understand the interdependence of the shortlisted enablers. The study provides holistic and practical insights to the stakeholders for improving the effectiveness of their firms by level partitioning the enablers as ‘givens’ (regulations and governance), ‘means’ (technology, financial implication, perishability, logistics and traceability) and ‘ends’ (inventory management, storage, collaboration, trust, hygiene, packaging and information sharing). The research findings will facilitate the strategic decision making regarding the reduction in the wastage of food thereby diminishing the level of carbon footprint creation. Apart from providing significant implications for the policymakers, the results also add the theoretical implications in the extant literature.}

In order to provide the railway system with the properties of adaptive control of low-capacity railcar traffic at the networks of large dimensions, an optimization mathematical model has been developed. To optimize this mathematical model, it is proposed to use a real coded genetic algorithm. The coding and decoding process of the chromosome of the genetic algorithm has been formed, which reflects the technological features of the implementation of the train formation plan of the grouped trains of operational purpose.

This problem can be overcome by adding presorting centers in the CLSC network since presorting costs are typically lower than the costs incurred at subsequent processing stages. Presorting centers can separate poor quality products at the start of the reverse logistics cycle and reduce transportation costs and emissions. In this paper, a deterministic mathematical model and its robust variant are proposed to investigate the effects of the quality of returns on the CLSC network under the carbon cap (CC) and carbon cap-and-trade (CCT) policies. Numerical experiments conducted with data from a real resource recovery company show the effects of varying return quality on total emissions and profit, the impact of presorting center efficiency and transportation cost on the opening of presorting centers, and the impacts of CC and CCT policies on the configuration of the CLSC network. The main insight of this paper is that the carbon cap policy affects the network structure much more than does the carbon cap and trade policy.}

Unique biokinetics allow them to transfer to neurons throughout the body and inflict neurotoxicity, which is challenging to evaluate solely in mammalian experimental models due to logistics, financial and ethical limitations.

Most importantly, this model organism has a well conserved and fully described nervous system rendering it ideal for use in neurotoxicity assessment of nanoparticles. In that context, this mini review aims to summarize the main mechanistic findings on nanoparticle related neurotoxicity in the setting of Caenorhabditis elegans screening. The injury pathway primarily involves changes in intestinal permeability and defecation frequency both of which facilitate translocation at the site of neurons, where toxicity formation is linked partly to oxidative stress and perturbed neurotransmission.}

Indeed, economic, procurement and logistics evaluations, possibly extended to the entire life cycle, are necessary to come to a decision for a new and radical solution. In this context, the paper investigates the complex set of information involved in the process to guide a designer in a structured assessment and evaluation of opportunities for the adoption of AM. The approach includes the analysis of the design requirements to evaluate the applicability of additive technologies. Selected design questions are presented as attention points to help designers in the decision-making process along with a metric to merge the answers in an overall compliance index. Finally, some test cases from the literature and industry are reported to validate the proposed decision process.}

We used 2000 images, 1000 each of both sexes from a publicly available database and automatically detected facial landmarks and derived some morphometric facial indices. These indices were used as predictors for the classification. As the traditional manual extraction of facial landmarks is time consuming, automatic detection of the landmarks improves the efficiency. The logistic regression classification is also compared with two other classification methods, the likelihood-ratio (LR) based method where the features of a face are evaluated in terms of the probability distribution of these features in both the sexes, and the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) methods. While is former is desirable from the viewpoint of interpretability and to assess the strength of evidence, the latter is sophisticated. We report an AUC of 0.94 with true positive (TP) rate of 88.4% for males and 87.9% for females for logistic regression-based classification. This performance is better than the likelihood ratio classifier with TP rate of 79.6% for males and 82.2% for females. The overall performance of logistics regression is slightly less than the CNN classifier that has 89.3% TP rate for males and 92.6% for females. We have extended these models to a CCTV image database, more representative of the forensic scenario and found the logistic regression performing better than the CNN method on an average for 8 different types of cameras. We conclude that as a trade-off between simplicity and sophistication, the logistic regression classifier can be used for a two-class problem like classification of sex from facial morphometric indices, and that the likelihood ratio approach can assess the strength of the classification, in conformance with the requirements of evidence interpretation.}

The nonlinear dynamical behaviors are intensely examined by using eigenvalue evaluation, bifurcation analysis and time series analysis to illustrate the stability of the competition and collaboration model. With the system theory based on fractional order calculus, various dynamic properties of ports system have been discovered. Based on the dynamical analysis, adaptive fractional-order sliding mode control with artificial neural network algorithm has been realized for port growth rate improvement against disruptions. Furthermore, the proposed approach is successfully validated by the case study of major Korean seaports for improving port operations through neural network prediction. The decision making policies implemented by control algorithms are guaranteed to improve the port growth rate against disruptions.

Platform supply vessels support the offshore oil and gas exploration and production activities by transporting all the necessary material and equipment back and forth between offshore units and an onshore supply base according to a delivery schedule. The PSVPP consists of solving a periodic vehicle routing problem and simultaneously determining an optimal fleet size and mix of heterogeneous offshore supply vessels, their weekly routes and schedules for servicing the offshore oil and gas installations, and the berth allocations at the supply base. The branch-and-cut algorithm considers a reduced formulation for the problem which performs much better than the complete one, and easily finds optimal solutions for the smaller and most of the clustered instances. The ALNS heuristic contains new features which include multiple starts and spaced local searches. These algorithms were tested on instances with up to 79 offshore units, providing better results than the best available.}

These batteries are used in electric and hybrid vehicles supporting the current agreements to decrease greenhouse gas emissions. As a result, the electric vehicle demand has increased in the world. As Li-ion batteries are composed of critical metals in which there is a risk of interruption of supply in the medium term, recycling is the key to a sustainable future without internal combustion vehicles. Understanding the current scenario and future perspectives is important for strategies of new battery design, recycling routes and reverse logistics, as well as policies for sustainable development. This paper presents an overview of current and future vehicles used worldwide. An increase from 1.3 to 2 billion vehicles is expected worldwide until 2030; an outstanding demand will occur mainly in BRICS countries. The data demonstrated a correlation between the number of vehicles in use and GDP. Patents and processes designed for recycling Li-ion batteries and the new developments on pyro-, hydro-, and bio-metallurgical routes have been revised.

abstract = {With the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chains are today confronted with more uncertainties than ever before. In the face of unanticipated disruptions, being resilient and sustainable has been rewarding for supply chains in terms of competitive advantage. However, literature is still far from possessing an encompassing sustainable supply chain framework (SSCF). As a contribution to the extant literature, the present study expounds a prominent concept termed negative entropy and explores its role in the SSCF. To accomplish this goal, the effect of negative entropy on supply chain sustainability is tested. Following the open systems theory and drawing from the collaboration and information management aspects of the negative entropy, co-creation, open innovation and network governance concepts which are considered to be relevant in this context are selected to be the antecedents of negative entropy. The empirical research is conducted on prominent logistics service providers and firms from various sectors with approved research and development departments in Turkey. The obtained data were subjected to covariance-based structural equation modeling analysis via Lisrel program. According to results, negative entropy is found to be a robust element in explaining supply chain sustainability. Furthermore, whereas co-creation and network governance reflected significant effects on negative entropy, surprisingly, open innovation demonstrated no substantial impact. This paper opens up a new front in sustainable supply chain management studies with a notable empirical study introducing negative entropy in the context of open systems theory.}

However, most of the existing models of emergency logistics do not account for domino effect and may be unsuitable for emergency response to accidents in chemical industrial parks. This paper presents a mathematical model proposed for optimal assignments of allocating and scheduling emergency resources for rescuing victims and preventing accident spreading simultaneously. The detailed characteristics of accident scenarios and emergency resources are taken into account. Based on this, the efficiency of emergency response is evaluated by the total number of fatalities and the amount of losses caused by domino effects which are the optimal objectives of the model. A numerical case study was conducted by solving the model using a designed heuristic algorithm. The results showed the applicability and reliability of the proposed model for making optimal assignments for emergency response to accidents in chemical industrial parks.}

Fellowship training provides a pivotal time for learners to attain baseline proficiency in such procedures to decrease patient complications. The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has posed distinct challenges to the traditional model of teaching and supervising IBPs in the intensive care unit, including stewardship of personal protective equipment and limiting health care worker exposure to persons with coronavirus disease 2019. To address these challenges, we piloted a novel method of IBP supervision and teaching using a virtual monitoring system. In this virtual procedural supervision model, the supervising teacher is located outside the patient room, limiting personal protective equipment use and health care worker exposure. An audiovisual monitoring system allowed communication between the teacher and the learner as well as supervisor visualization of the procedural encounter. Virtual supervision was used for central line placement and bronchoscopy in the medical intensive care unit with no complications or instances of the supervisor needing to enter the patient room. Success was felt to depend on camera positioning and preprocedure planning and to be best for advanced learners who would not require tactile feedback. Upper level learners appreciated autonomy granted by this process. Virtual IBP supervision is felt to be a useful tool in specific situations. As with any tool, there are notable strengths and limitations. Success is felt to be optimized when attention is paid to procedural teaching best practices, learner selection, and technological logistics.}

With respect to group decision-making (GDM) problems, it is convenient for experts to express their evaluation opinions with probabilistic linguistic preference relations (PLPRs), which can transform experts’ quantitative descriptions into qualitative probabilistic linguistic terms. The processes of consistency-adjustment and expert weights determination play a key role in GDM. Therefore, this paper aims at the design of a novel probabilistic linguistic GDM method with consistency-adjustment algorithm and trust relationship-driven expert weight determination model. First, we redefine the multiplicative consistency of PLPRs, which only involves changing the probabilities of linguistic terms. A new distance between PLPRs is presented to calculate the consistency index. Then, we propose a convergent consistency-adjustment algorithm to improve the consistency of a PLPR to an acceptable consistency level. Subsequently, a trust relationship-driven expert weight determination model is developed to derive the experts’ weights in a social network environment. Finally, a probabilistic linguistic GDM method is designed to determine the reliable ranking of alternatives. The advantages and applicability of the proposed method are illustrated by a case study concerning an evaluation of logistics service suppliers and associated comparative analyses.}

We find that oTree and SoPHIE rank highest across criteria, but Veconlab and classEx might be suitable for those with a dominant need for a large library of ready-made experiments. We find a portability gap: no presently available software allows portability of experiments across platforms because of technical complexity and the challenging coordination needs of experimental economists. As a result, experiments may be replicated only on the same platform or with the same software, but general replicability is slow and costly. This constrains the development of experimental economics as a replicable science.}

Urban utility tunnels can house various kinds of city ‘lifelines’ such as natural gas pipeline, heat pipeline, water supply system, sewer pipeline, electricity and telecommunication cables, which are of great significance to guarantee essential flows of energy, information and logistics for urban life. If a utility tunnel accident occurs, the consequences could be catastrophic. Risk assessment has been an important tool to examine the safety performance of industrial facilities and the effectiveness of safety measures. In this study, an integrated model based on dynamic hazard scenario identification (DHSI), Bayesian network (BN) modeling and risk analysis is proposed for risk assessment of urban utility tunnels. The worst-case scenario of urban utility tunnel accidents is identified by DHSI and modelled by BN. Meanwhile, risk analysis is conducted based on the results of BN considering casualties and economic losses. Finally, the integrated method is applied to evaluate the risk level of a real-world utility tunnel. The results indicate that the integrated quantitative risk assessment framework is an alternative and effective tool for safety assessment and land-use planning of urban utility tunnels.}

Such scenario connects two important consequences: (a) fire damage and (b) radiation health threat. Computational simulations considering hypothetic fire scenarios in hospitals using radioactive material can provide valuable information about such an event. The initial decision in regards to an emergency response should consider the fire consequences and radiation doses distribution in the environment with consequences appearing at different times. While the fire presents an immediate threat, radiation exposure also creates immediate and future concerns. The purpose of this study is to evaluate leukemia risk from a hypothetical radiological fire event in a hospital operating Cs-137 gamma blood irradiator. The simulation in this study used the Hotspot Health Physics software to generate output data such as total effective dose (TED). The data from HotSpot was then used as an input to the leukemia risk equations from Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation Committee V and VII (BEIR V and VII) models accordingly. Results suggest that the risks are dependent of wind speed and height of release; however, when age and sex are taken into account different outputs are shown. Also, the risk model can be changed from BEIR VII (low doses) to BEIR V (high doses) as radiation doses rise due to its time-dependent behavior. Such change would bring potential impacts on logistics and risk communication.}

The emergence and proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) - the use of interconnected devices, sensors, and technologies to orchestrate, monitor, and optimize supply chain processes - holds innovative potentials for the halal food supply chain (HFSC). Despite the growing popularity in supply chain management and logistics, the potentials and challenges of IoT in the HFSC remain – unexplored and further research is required . Therefore, the goal of this paper is to address this knowledge gap and review IoT research within the context of HFSCs. To begin, over seventy-three (73) papers were analyzed using both bibliometric techniques and in-depth content analysis. The results reveal that IoT offers five major benefits for the HFSC; namely, traceability of products, enhancement of supply chain efficiencies, facilitation of livestock management, authentication of foods’ halal status, and monitoring of halal certifications. Several challenges were identified, including the technical limitations of IoT devices, technological immaturity, lack of user acceptance, and cost and regulatory barriers. The study's findings provide deeper insight into the current state of IoT research in the halal food literature, its development, challenges and future research avenues for scholars, policy makers and the HFSC community.}

The most widely employed global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver models—specifically, single-difference and double-difference algorithms—can provide reasonable performance and cost for general needs only. Many precision-demanding applications require attitude determination, such as logistics vehicles in transportation and driverless vehicles in cities. They also pursue more sophisticated and cost-effective schemes. This study proposes, for the first time, a novel concept of entanglement difference of carrier phase for the synchronized multi-antenna sets of each GNSS receiver without an inertial navigation system, which is justified by establishing a rigorous mathematical foundation. Moreover, through deliberate experimental design, implementation, and calibration at the system level, this study achieves record higher performances than typical commercial products on the attitude determination precision for the yaw, pitch, and roll angles in both static and dynamic experiments, which demonstrates the strength of this technique and paves the way for its commercialization in the growing GNSS market, especially for China’s BeiDou global networking applications.}

abstract = {Background and objectives
Several anthropometric measurements have been suggested to identify a potentially difficult airway. We studied thyromental height (TMH) as a predictor of difficult laryngoscopy and difficult intubation. We also compared TMH, ratio of height to thyromental distance (RHTMD), and thyromental distance (TMD) as predictors of difficult airway.
Methods
This cross-sectional observational study was conducted in 300 adult surgical patients requiring tracheal intubation. Preoperatively airway characteristics were assessed. Standard anesthesia was administered. Degree of difficulty with mask ventilation, laryngoscopic view, duration of laryngoscopy, and difficulty in tracheal intubation (intubation difficulty scale score) were noted. Multivariate logistics regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors for difficult laryngoscopy.
Results
Laryngoscopy was difficult in 46 of 300 (15.3%) patients; all 46 patients had Cormack-Lehane grade 3 view. Duration of laryngoscopy was 27 ± 11 s in patients with difficult laryngoscopy and 12.7 ± 3.9 s in easy laryngoscopy; p = 0.001. Multivariate analysis identified that TMH, presence of short neck, and history of snoring were independently associated with difficult laryngoscopy. Incidence of difficult intubation was 17.0%. A shorter TMH was associated with higher IDS scores; r = -0.16, p = 0.001. TMH and duration of laryngoscopy were found to be negatively correlated; a shorter TMH was associated with a longer duration of laryngoscopy; r = -0.13, p = 0.03. The cut-off threshold value for TMH in our study is 4.4 cm with a sensitivity of 66% and a specificity of 54%.
Conclusion
Thyromental height predicts difficult laryngoscopy and difficult intubation. TMD and RHTMD did not prove to be useful as predictors of difficult airway.}

With large urban agglomerations characterized by rapid and uncontrolled urban development, wetlands in African cities are under intense pressure of extinction. Yet, research exploring their urban planning implications, spatial extent and management regimes in Africa remains limited. Using urban ecology theory as a theoretical framework and Kumasi, the second largest city in Ghana, as a case study, this paper explores: (i) the state of wetlands in Kumasi via spatiotemporal analysis; (ii) local perceptions and attitudes towards the use and management of wetlands; and (iii) urban planning responses to wetland use and management. Using spatial data and qualitative research methods (e.g., community interviews, institutional consultations and document review), findings indicate increasing depletion and gradual extinction of wetlands in Kumasi due to conversion of wetlands into residential and other uses. Fundamentally, alterations in the use of wetlands have led to increased flood events in the city. Planning interventions (e.g., embankment of wetlands, creating channels for easy flow of river) have largely failed due to limited local engagement, existence of poorly implemented land tenure system in the city, and the powerlessness of the urban planning institutions, in terms of logistics, personnel and authority. Recommendations to improve upon the situation are proffered.}

abstract = {Objective
To examine best practices and policies for effectively merging community and academic physicians in integrated health care systems.
Methods
Deans of US allopathic medical schools were systematically interviewed between February and June 2017 regarding growth in their faculty practice plan (FPP), including logistics and best practices for integration of community physicians.
Results
The survey was completed by 107 of 143 (74.8) of US medical school deans approached. Of these institutions, 73 met criteria for final analysis (research-based medical schools with FPPs of >300 physicians). Most academic medical center–based FPPs have increased in size over the last 5 years, with further growth anticipated via adding community physicians (85%). Because of disparate practice locations, integration of community and academic physicians has been slow. When fully integrated, community physicians predominantly have a clinical role with productivity incentives. Deans report that cultural issues must be addressed to avoid conflict. Consensus exists that transparent clinical work requirements for all FPP members, clearly defined productivity incentives, additional promotion tracks, and early involvement of department chairs and other leaders enhances trust and creates better synergy among all physician providers.
Conclusion
Findings from this study should help guide FPPs, academic medical center leaders, chief medical officers, and professional and trade organizations in working toward positive physician synergy in consolidated health care organizations. Work and cultural considerations must be addressed to honor distinct talents of each physician group, facilitating smooth transition from disparate groups to healthy synergy.}

Although this phenomenon is one of the worst types of disaster in terms of casualties, water distribution to those affected by the drought still lacks academic development, and few studies guide local public managers regarding the efficient use of available resources, guaranteeing a high service level to the population. This paper presents a procedure for the implementation of transport and routing of water delivery. By this procedure, we can evaluate the strategy of complementary use of the water supply of drilled artesian wells. It also provides a contextualized routing tool for the practices and policies of motorized water distribution, commonly found in scenarios of water shortages. The algorithms have been implemented considering the capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP), providing a friendly-user tool that helps choosing water sources to be activated and in the definition of the routes between these and the points supply. Results have been validated in the Brazilian Semi - arid region, showing improvement in the current logistical performance of drought coping, in advantageous scales of operation in terms of costs and efficiency.}

Freight transport is an increasingly important contributor to global warming. With the projected development of international trade, finding the most energy efficient ways of service intercontinental trades is a key challenge. China-Europe containerized trades are among the most important in this setting. The typical structure of the supply chains associated with this trade is that containers are stuffed in China and then cargos are subsequently cross-docked at major European logistics hubs or distribution centers in the destination countries for further road transport to the final retailing points. This solution may not be optimal from an environmental perspective. To pursue an increasingly sustainable supply chain solution, early movers in the market have adopted an alternative solution that is characterized by upstream buyer consolidation and downstream rail-based intermodal transport. This paper develops a set of mathematical models for analyzing the environmental saving potential of such alternative solutions, encompassing relevant energy use and energy mix data of all the legs and nodes in the supply chains. The empirical analysis is based on a case obtained from a Swedish retailer with a chain of retailing points in Scandinavia and Poland. From an activity-based approach, our findings suggest that upstream buyer consolidation may facilitate the integration of rail and road transport in the destination country, increase container utilization, replace 20-foot containers by 40-foot containers and eliminate the extra de-/re-consolidation activity in the traditional solution, thereby reducing CO2 emissions of the supply chain. This, more efficient supply chain solution, may facilitate a modal shift in the downstream part of the supply chains, which may be attractive to logistics providers, retailers and customers in search of ways of curbing CO2 emissions. The models and analytical framework developed may also be used by practitioners and researchers for analyzing other alternative supply chain designs.}

It concludes that supply chain managers still lack a decision support system able to access new information in near real time. The paper describes the components of the AIC information system, and the implications for a supply chain use case. By testing the architecture on a pharmaceutical supply chain, we assess the accuracy, cost and speed of the detection of new risks. These works are made possible by the use of several data streams aggregated into a single decision-making platform. This supports the claim for a more connected supply chain. Our contributions make crisis management knowledge available to supply chain management and help improving resilient decision-making in a fast changing context.}

Therefore, it is crucial to understand consumer acceptance so that the companies in these markets can develop their penetration strategies accordingly and technology companies can shape their technology development strategies. This study aims to examine individuals' adoption attitudes toward AVs by considering trust and sustainability concerns. This was achieved by expanding the technology acceptance model (TAM). A survey of 391 participants was conducted and the data were analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM). The results confirmed previous technology acceptance models by showing the relationships between perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and behavioral intention. Moreover, the direct and indirect effects of trust on behavioral intention were also shown. This study provides evidence to extend the TAM to the adoption of AVs by uncovering individuals’ sustainability concerns.}

Compared with the static vehicle routing problem, DVRP is characterized by the prior unknown customer requests dynamically appearing in route execution. Nevertheless, the newly appeared customers pose a great challenge to route optimizer, since the optimized route may be contrarily of bad quality when including the new customers that are far from planned routes in route planning. To address this issue, in this paper we propose a demand coverage diversity based metaheuristic, termed ACO-CD, in the framework of ant colony algorithm. In ACO-CD, a demand coverage diversity adaptation method is suggested to maintain the diversity of covered customers in routes so that the optimizer can effectively response to the newly appeared customer requests. Experimental results on 27 DVRP test instances demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed demand coverage diversity adaptation method and the superiority of the proposed ACO-CD over four state-of-the-art DVRP algorithms in terms of solution quality.}

In this paper, a new multi-objective mixed-integer programming (MIP) model is proposed for scheduling and routing of heterogeneous vehicles carrying perishable goods across multiple cross-docking systems. Inspired by the actual business operations of a large supermarket chain, multiple cross-docks with simultaneous split pick-up and delivery tasks are considered, each of which processing either general or perishable products. In addition, all pick-up/delivery (P/D) requests for perishable products have a deadline that must be met. The main objectives of the developed model are to reduce distribution costs, accelerate distribution processing time, and maximize the cross-docking network’s capacity utilization rate. To overcome the complexity of the formulated problem, a novel hybrid solution method, namely AUGMECON2-VIKOR is developed and used in the case-study. The results reveal that AUGMECON2-VIKOR outperforms AUGMECON2, particularly when a larger number of grid points are considered in the proposed solution algorithm.}

This study aimed to describe the nursing care implementations in the outpatient installations of several hospitals.
Method
A descriptive study design was used with purposive random sampling. A total of 292 patients were included based on the following criteria: treated at the internal, neurological, ear, nose, and throat, pulmonary, surgical, skin, sex, and heart disease polyclinics, able to read and write, and attended more than one visit. This study was conducted in three central referral hospitals in the Bogor, Depok, and Jakarta areas of Indonesia.
Results
The outpatient care implementation was not optimal in the three regional public hospitals (56.8%). The nurses minimally performed the outpatient nursing processes, namely diagnosis enforcement (63.7%) and implementation (62%).
Conclusion
The implementation of care that is not optimal can result in a decrease in patient satisfaction and safety. The support of hospital management is needed to facilitate the availability of adequate nursing resources (both quantity and quality) and to provide equipment, facilities, and logistics to optimize nursing care.}

It aims at finding the optimal vehicle routes and two-dimensional packing layouts of items in each vehicle to minimize the transportation cost. In this work, we present a mathematical model of 2L-SDVRP with wide-ranging practical considerations. Then we propose an enhanced neighborhood search algorithm (ENS) incorporated with the maximum-space-utilization-based tabu search packing algorithm (MSUTS) to solve the 2L-SDVRP, where the MSUTS examines the feasibility of packing in each route. To accelerate the solving process, a sequence-optimization and random-splitting-based initialization strategy is further proposed. Meanwhile, three classical neighborhood operators are modified to adapt to the 2L-SDVRP with split delivery and two-dimensional packing. The proposed algorithms are tested on a large number of instances varying with scales and properties, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for solving the 2L-SDVRP. Observation of the results also infers the split delivery shows an economic advantage over the non-split case and the advantage becomes significant when the total area of items of each customer increases.}

In order to optimise the timing and size of such projects, the literature has indicated that real options (RO) are better suited than the more traditional net present value (NPV) approach. The models are very theoretical and difficult to implement in practice. The objective of this paper is to extend the empirical RO literature in transportation and logistics by bringing continuous-time continuous-state RO models closer to practitioners. This is done by means of developing a blueprint for a practical software application through which port investment managers can easily calculate their optimal decisions. Additionally, the blueprint of this practical implementation allows for a better understanding of the continuous RO logic and way of working. As the discussion of the RO advantages shows, optimising the decision through continuous RO models, rather than applying NPV, can allow ports to realise a much better investment and generate a lot more value from port investment projects. Nevertheless, depending on the specific situation, practitioners might require supplementary assistance of econometricians or consultants to estimate the RO model input parameters. This paper also adds to the literature by quantifying these potential gains and costs.}

Many studies have been carried out in modelling COVID-19 pandemic. However, region-wise average duration of recovery from COVID-19 has not been attempted; hence, an effort has been made to estimate state-wise recovery duration of India's COVID-19 patients. Determining the recovery time in each region is intended to assist healthcare professionals in providing better care and planning of logistics.
Methods
This study used database provided by Kaggle, which takes data from the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare. The simple Linear Regression model between incidence, prevalence, and duration was used to assess the duration of COVID-19 disease in various Indian states.
Results
The fitted model suits ideal for most of the states, except for some union territories and northeastern states. The average time to recover from disease was ranging from 5 to 36 days in Indian states/union territories except for Madhya Pradesh. Tamil Nadu has an average recovery time of 7 days with an value of 0.96, followed by Odisha, Karnataka, West Bengal, Kerala and Chhattisgarh and the average recovery duration was estimated as 7, 13, 17, 11, 14 and 12 days respectively.
Conclusion
The average recovery from COVID-19 was ten or less days in twenty percentage of states, whereas in forty-four percentage of states/union territories had an average recovery duration between ten to twenty days. However, around twentyfour percentage of states/union territory recovered between twenty to thirty days. In the rest of Indian states/union territories, the average duration of recovery was more than thirty days.}

This article provides a better understanding of how three major tardiness indicators can be used to improve the quality of service by minimizing the maximum tardiness, the total tardiness, or the number of late deliveries.

Numerical results show that this novel Benders approach with a tailored combinatorial algorithm for generating Benders cuts largely outperforms all other alternatives. In our managerial study, we vary the number of available facilities, the coverage radius of autonomous robots and their speed, to assess their impact on the quality of service and environmental costs.}
