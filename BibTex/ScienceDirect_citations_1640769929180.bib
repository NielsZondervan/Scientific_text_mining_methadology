abstract = {Drone has become an important buzzword in the logistics sector in recent times. Drone deliveries have a two-pronged advantage as they have the potential to lessen delivery time by avoiding traffic congestions, and the inherent structure that reduces its carbon footprint compared to traditional modes of transportation under some restrictions. To leverage this potential, many companies across the world have developed and tested drones for real-world applications. However, many factors may play a significant role in the adoption of drone-delivery in the logistics sector. This paper attempts to unearth such critical success factors and establish the interrelationships between these factors. Twelve critical success factors were identified by systematically reviewing the literature and taking inputs from experts. An integrated multi-criteria decision-making technique, decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL)’, combined with the Grey-based approach, was used to envisage causal relationships between the identified critical success factors. The results reveal that ‘Technological advancements’ and ‘Government regulations’ are the most influential factors that impact the adoption of drones in the logistics sector. The research implications of these findings will help practitioners and policymakers effectively implement drones in the logistics sector.}

The first echelon consists of large eco-package transport, which is modeled by a time-discretized transport-concentrated network flow programming in the resource sharing state–space–time (SST) network. The second echelon focuses on small eco-package pickups and deliveries, established by the cost-minimized synchronization-oriented location routing model that minimizes the total generalized cost, which includes internal transportation cost, value of eco-packages, short-term benefits and environmental externalities. In addition, the Gaussian mixture clustering algorithm is utilized to assign customers to their respective service providers in the pickup and delivery process, and a Clarke–Wright saving method-based non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II is designed to optimize pickup and delivery routes, and improve their cost-effectiveness and degree of synchronization. Different strategy testing results are used in the service phase as input data to calculate the cost of the transport phase, which is solved through a Lagrangian relaxation approach. The 3D SST network representation innovatively captures the eco-package route sequence and state transition constraints over the shortest path in the pickup and delivery at any given moment of the transport phase. A large-scale logistics network in Chengdu, China, is used to demonstrate the proposed model and algorithm, and undertake sensitivity analysis considering the life cycle of green eco-packages.}

abstract = {In logistics operation, delivery times are often uncertain for customers, and accommodating this uncertainty poses operation challenges as well as extra cost for logistics service providers. The delivery time uncertainty is particularly an issue if there are multiple service providers in a logistics network. To address this issue, we formulate and solve a collaborative multi-depot vehicle routing problem with time window assignment (CMDVRPTWA) to effectively reduce the impact of changing time windows on operating costs. This paper establishes a bi-objective programming model that optimize the total operating cost and the total number of delivery vehicles. A hybrid heuristic algorithm consisting of K-means clustering, Clarke–Wright (CW) saving algorithm and an Extended Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (E-NSGA-II) is presented to efficiently solve CMDVRPTWA. The clustering and CW saving algorithm are employed to increase the likelihood of finding the optimal vehicle routes by identifying a feasible initial solution. The E-NSGA-II procedure combines partial-mapped crossover (PMC), relocation, 2-opt* exchange and swap mutation operations to find the optimal solution with pre-defined iteration and termination rules. Profit allocation schemes are then analyzed using the Game Quadratic Programming (GQP) method, and the optimal sequences of joining coalitions are obtained based on the principle that coalition participants’ benefits should be non-decreasing when a new participant joins the coalition. We conduct three empirical studies on a small-scale example, on several benchmark datasets and on a large-scale logistics network in Chongqing city, China. Further comparative analysis indicates that E-NSGA-II outperforms most other algorithms in solving CMDVRPTWA. This novel approach identifies profit allocation strategies that ensure the stability and reliability of the collaborative coalitions in the context of flexible customer service time windows, and can be utilized to improve the efficiency of urban logistics and intelligent transportation networks.}

A bilevel optimization formulation explicitly models the two stage decision process: first, the platform determines which set of requests to recommend to which suppliers, and second, suppliers have a choice to select which request (if any) to fulfill. By harnessing the problem’s structure, the computationally expensive mixed-integer linear bilevel problem is transformed into an equivalent single-level problem that is computationally superior. A computational study based on ride-sharing quantifies the value of providing suppliers with choices. When a platform’s knowledge of suppliers’ selections is imperfect, our hierarchical approach outperforms existing recommendation methods, namely, centralized, many-to-many stable matching, and decentralized approaches. We show that a platform’s lack of knowledge over suppliers’ selections can be compensated by providing choices in environments with either inflexible suppliers or when suppliers’ utilities have higher variance than the platform’s utilities. In these environments, providing choices and recommending alternatives to more than one supplier can be beneficial to not only the platform, but also freelance suppliers and demand requests.}

The research approach included a preliminary (secondary) research to assess the market conditions of the logistics sector in Greece before and during the financial crisis and a quantitative survey that took place in 2017 with 100 freight forwarders to understand the decision-making process for freight mode choice. Our analysis indicates that the logistics sector in Greece is growing even if the economic situation of the Greek economy has been deteriorated. The model developed an error component logit model and allowed capturing the taste variation of individuals’ concerning travel time and the estimation of minimum, average, and maximum FVOTs per transport mode. The relative magnitude of the estimated FVOTs confirmed our assumption that freight forwarders prefer road transport modes and are willing to pay more for their usage, whereas a comparative analysis with countries with similar politicoeconomic conditions, such as Italy, revealed that the FVOTs obtained for Greece are lower, and this could be attributed to the economic situation of the country.}

Multiple exact and metaheuristic methodologies are utilized and evaluated on several small to medium-sized instances and a case study. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is evaluated and shown by examining various multi-objective performance measures. The case study is researched in more depth to obtain managerial insights, and the results show that depending on the risk or cost efficiency of the solutions on a Pareto frontier, the risk of traversing longer routes or transporting larger amounts of cash can be determining in locating new bank vaults.}

Moving waste receptacles from the interior to the exits of a park makes waste collection more efficient, but can have opposing effects: Decreased littering because of greater care inspired by the perception of natural beauty in a park without artifacts like waste receptacles, or increased littering because of the greater distance to waste receptacles. Preceded by an online study (N = 153), three successive field studies showed mixed evidence for increased littering when moving waste receptacles to the exits (Study 2 and 3). However, when additionally attaching pictures of watching animal eyes to trees in the park (Study 4), litter levels seemed to decrease. We conclude that littering is best countered with a combination of persuasive communication and physical measures.}

abstract = {Ports are located in low-lying coastal and riverine areas making them prone to the physical impacts of natural disasters. The consequential disruptions can potentially propagate through supply chains, resulting in widespread economic losses. Previous studies to quantify the risks of port disruptions have adopted various modelling assumptions about the resilience of individual ports and marine network logistics. However, limited empirical evidence is available to validate these modelling assumptions or to provide deeper understanding of the ways in which operations are adapted during and after disruptions. Here, we use vessel tracking data to analyse past port disruptions due to natural disasters, evaluating 141 incidences of disruptions across 74 ports and 27 disasters. Results show a median disruption duration of six days with a 95th percentile of 22.2 days. All analysed events show multiple ports being affected simultaneously, challenging some of the studies that only focus on single port disruptions. Moreover, we find that the duration of the disruption scales with the severity of the event, with an increment of 1.0 m storm surge or 10 m/s wind speed associated with a two day increase in disruption duration. In contrast to commonplace assumptions in model studies, substitution between ports is rarely observed during short-term disruptions. On the other hand, production recapture happens in practice in many cases of port disruptions. In short, empirical vessel tracking data provides valuable insights for future modelling studies in order to better approximate the extent of the disruption and the potential resilience of the port and maritime network.}

Eco-innovation can aid freight transport firms through fostering sustainable transportation alternatives at best possible costs to ensure effective decision- making for freight logistics sustainability. Yet, freight logistics companies are faced with numerous difficulties when attempting to implement eco-innovation practices along their supply chains. This paper therefore identifies the challenges to implementing eco-innovation practices for freight logistics sustainability to aid management to take informed decisions to overcome these challenges before the environmental burdens become critical. The Best- Worst method is adopted to evaluate and rank these challenges in terms of their relative importance in Nigeria, an emerging economy, which is characterized by increased consumption due to huge population size coupled with government green requirements. The results depict that unavailable funds, lack of clarity on the financial benefits of eco-innovation practices, poor technology infrastructure and reluctant attitude towards eco-innovation practices are the most pressing challenges amongst the challenges faced by Nigeria freight logistics companies. These results will provide insight and guidelines for decision-makers and policymakers in the freight logistics sector who seeks to integrate eco-innovation initiatives to achieve sustainability.}

Inner-city center deliveries are performed by small vehicles due to access restrictions, while deliveries outside this area are carried out by conventional vehicles for economic reasons. Goods are transferred from the first to the second echelon by synchronized meetings between vehicles of the respective echelons. We investigate the assignment of customers to vehicles, i.e., to the first or second echelon, within a so-called ‘grey zone’ on the border of the inner city and the area around it. While doing this, the economic objective as well as negative external effects of transport, such as emissions and disturbance (negative impact on citizens due to noise and congestion), are taken into account to include objectives of companies as well as of citizens and municipal authorities. Our metaheuristic – a large neighborhood search embedded in a heuristic rectangle/cuboid splitting – addresses this problem efficiently. We investigate the impact of the free assignment of part of the customers (‘grey zone’) to echelons and of three different city layouts on the solution. Computational results show that the impact of a ‘grey zone’ and thus the assignment of these customers to echelons depend significantly on the layout of a city. Potentially pareto-optimal solutions for two and three objectives are illustrated to efficiently support decision makers in sustainable city logistics planning processes.}

abstract = {The maritime transport and the port-logistic industry are key drivers of economic growth, although, they represent major contributors to climate change. In particular, maritime port facilities are typically located near cities or residential areas, thus having a significant direct environmental impact, in terms of air and water quality, as well as noise. The majority of the pollutant emissions in ports comes from cargo ships, and from all the related ports activities carried out by road vehicles. Therefore, a progressive reduction of the use of fossil fuels as a primary energy source for these vehicles and the promotion of cleaner powertrain alternatives is in order. The present study deals with the design of a new propulsion system for a heavy-duty vehicle for port applications. Specifically, this work aims at laying the foundations for the development of a benchmark industrial cargo–handling hydrogen-fueled vehicle to be used in real port operations. To this purpose, an on-field measurement campaign has been conducted to analyze the duty cycle of a commercial Diesel-engine yard truck currently used for terminal ports operations. The vehicle dynamics has been numerically modeled and validated against the acquired data, and the energy and power requirements for a plug-in fuel cell/battery hybrid powertrain replacing the Diesel powertrain on the same vehicle have been evaluated. Finally, a preliminary design of the new powertrain and a rule-based energy management strategy have been proposed, and the electric energy and hydrogen consumptions required to achieve the target driving range for roll-on and roll-off operations have been estimated. The results are promising, showing that the hybrid electric vehicle is capable of achieving excellent energy performances, by means of an efficient use of the fuel cell. An overall amount of roughly 12 kg of hydrogen is estimated to be required to accomplish the most demanding port operation, and meet the target of 6 h of continuous operation. Also, the vehicle powertrain ensures an adequate all-electric range, which is between approximately 1 and 2 h depending on the specific port operation. Potentially, the hydrogen-fueled yard truck is expected to lead to several benefits, such as local zero emissions, powertrain noise elimination, reduction of the vehicle maintenance costs, improving of the energy management, and increasing of operational efficiency.}

However, in selecting an industrial corporate brand managers accorded greater importance to industrial corporate brand image and to System 1 processing. The study also found that a positive industrial corporate brand image of logistics brands has a favorable impact apropos premium pricing and brand retention. As such, the research reveals how the selection of an industrial corporate brand by managers is materially shaped by corporate brand image and, moreover, the process of selection is more nuanced and complicated that has hitherto been realized.}

abstract = {Background
Cold chain logistics (CCL) is not only vital for maintaining the quality and safety of fresh agro-products and reducing losses but also provides important support to help increase farmer income and thereby promote the revitalization of rural industry in China. In recent years, numerous studies have focused on improving the efficiency and sustainability of CCL, and the results have important implications for promoting innovation, applying technologies, improving facilities and equipment, and optimizing management in the CCL industry.
Scope and approach
This review discusses active research areas, gaps in the existing state of research, and future research challenges for CCL. Furthermore, we summarize the current status of China's CCL industry and technology and compare the state of CCL development in China with that in more developed countries in terms of infrastructure, data handling, and national policies.
Key findings and conclusions
The future trends of CCL involve low carbon strategies and intelligent innovation, which are the key to meeting environmental concerns and the evolving needs of the market. Advances in next-generation information technology (including IoT, blockchain, AI, etc.) have significantly accelerated the modernization of CCL. Meanwhile, attaining these dual objectives of a low-carbon footprint and intelligent innovation requires cooperation between national regulators, industry, consumers, and interdisciplinary experts. A key finding of this review is that national policy and financial intervention in China are expected to be the main forces behind renovating infrastructure and upgrading standardization, which is required to narrow the CCL development gap between China and other more developed nations.}

As per the Global Agenda Council on Logistics and Supply Chains indicated that fruits and vegetables food losses due to improper handling and lack of proper cold transportation such as cold-logistics facilities/providers or inadequate infrastructure. In this article, a unique fuzzy Multi-Criteria Decision Making approach is proposed for improving the food losses through cold-third party logistics providers (CTPLs) evaluation and selection process. Through a literature survey and expert opinion, five criteria and thirty sub-criteria were identified for reducing the food losses in fruits and vegetable supply chain. The proposed tool use of fuzzy-Decision making trial and evaluation laboratory tool for selection and evaluation the priority weights of the factors and fuzzy-analytical hierarchy process tool assessing the best CTPLs according to factors. The result shows that ‘Refrigerator and loading capacity’ and ‘Knowledge and Information technology management’ were most significant in the selection of CTPLs. The findings of this paper are anticipated to guide managers of the food industry, CTPLs, and government agencies in formulating of strategies for the practical food supply chain. Future scope includes extending the study for other developing countries, validating the proposed methodology, and improving the reliability of the model.}

Designing an efficient and reliable IMW reverse logistics network in this situation can help to control the spread of the virus. Studies on this issue are limited, and minimization of costs and the risks associated with the operations of this network consisting of different types of medical waste generation centers (MWGC) are rarely considered. In this research, a linear programming model with three objective functions is developed to minimize the total costs, the risk associated with the transportation and treatment of IMW, and the maximum amount of uncollected waste in MWGCs. Also, multiple functions that calculate the amount of generated waste according to the parameters of the current epidemic outbreak are proposed. Revised Multi-Choice Goal Programming method is employed to solve the multi-objective model, and a real case study from Iran is examined to illustrate the validation of the proposed model. The final results show that the model can create a balance between three considered objectives by determining the flow between centers, deciding to install two new temporary treatment centers, and allowing the network to only have uncollected waste in the first two periods in some MWGCs. Also, managerial insights for health organization authorities extracted from the final results and sensitivity analyses are presented for adequately handling the IMW network.}

In a few years, these applications will be fully integrated into our lives. The practical application and use of UAVs presents several problems that are of a different nature to the specific technology of the components involved. Among them, the most relevant problem deriving from the use of UAVs in logistics distribution tasks is the so-called “last mile” delivery. In the present work, we focus on the resolution of the truck-drone team logistics problem. The problems of tandem routing have a complex structure and have only been partially addressed in the scientific literature. The use of UAVs raises a series of restrictions and considerations that did not appear previously in routing problems; most notably, aspects such as the limited power-life of batteries used by the UAVs and the determination of rendezvous points where they are replaced by fully-charged new batteries. These difficulties have until now limited the mathematical formulation of truck-drone routing problems and their resolution to mainly small-size cases. To overcome these limitations we propose an iterated greedy heuristic based on the iterative process of destruction and reconstruction of solutions. This process is orchestrated by a global optimization scheme using a simulated annealing (SA) algorithm. We test our approach in a large set of instances of different sizes taken from literature. The obtained results are quite promising, even for large-size scenarios.}

This problem is even more severe in fresh food transportation, where temperature control is used to guarantee product quality. On a route with multiple stops, the quality of the transported products could be negatively influenced by the door openings and consequent temperature fluctuations. In this study, we quantify the effects of multi-stop transportation on food quality. To realistically model and quantify food quality, we develop a time-and temperature-dependent kinetic model for a vehicle routing problem. The proposed extensions of the vehicle routing problem enable quantification of quality decay on a route. The model is illustrated using a case study of cooperative routing, and our results show that longer, multi-stop routes can negatively influence food quality, especially for products delivered later in the route, and when the products are very temperature-sensitive and the outside temperature is high. Minimising quality loss results in multiple routes with fewer stops per route, whereas minimising costs or emissions results in longer routes. By adjusting driving speed, unloading rate, cooling rate, and by setting a quality threshold level, the negative quality consequences of multi-stop routes can be mitigated.}

However, current research mainly focuses on energy-saving and emission reduction through improving the energy efficiency of equipment or optimizing the operation and management of cold chain logistics enterprises, rarely considering the government policy. This paper constructs a decision-making model of cold chain logistics system by using the method of bilevel programming. The upper level is the government's goal, pursuing the total cost minimization of the whole cold chain logistics system. The lower level is the goal of the cold chain logistics enterprise, pursuing the cost minimization of the enterprise. Chaotic particle swarm optimization (CPSO) was developed to improve this model, and this method was applied to the decision-making of cold chain logistics system in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. The study reveals: (1) The joint use of carbon emission reduction subsidies and carbon emission quota optimization measures is more effective in promoting energy-saving and emission reduction of enterprises than using them separately; (2) The carbon emission quota set by the government should not be too high or too low; (3) The government subsidy limits for carbon emission reduction have a significant impact on the carbon emission reduction of enterprises; (4) The subsidy rate per unit carbon emission reduction can adjust the total carbon emissions and total carbon emission reduction of enterprises. This study provides a scientific basis and inspires the government and enterprise in decision-making to improve the energy-saving and emission reduction of the whole society.}

In this paper, we study the crowdsourced parcel delivery problem, a new type of transportation, with consideration of complex and practical cases, such as multiple delivery vehicles, just-in-time (JIT) pickup and delivery, minimum fuel consumption, and maximum profitability. For this we suggest a learning-based logistics planning and scheduling (LLPS) algorithm that controls admission of order requests and schedules the routes of multiple vehicles altogether. For the admission control, we utilize reinforcement learning (RL) with a function approximation using an artificial neural network (ANN). Also, we use a continuous-variable feedback control algorithm to schedule routes that minimize both JIT penalty and fuel consumption. Computational experiments show that the LLPS outperforms other similar approaches by 32% on average in terms of average reward earned from each delivery order. In addition, the LLPS is even more advantageous when the rate of order arrivals is high and the number of vehicles that transport parcels is low.}

Firstly, this paper introduces the data layer, network layer and consensus layer in the block chain, and then establishes the steel logistics architecture under the block chain technology. Then, it analyzes the management of logistics information resources in the supply chain from the object, attribute and function dimensions. Finally, the improved PFBT algorithm is used to test their de-centralization security and algorithm performance in the system of iron and steel enterprise logistics transactions.

In particular, the maritime container transport network significantly evolved to such an extent that it has increased its importance in the global supply chain. Container transport between shippers and consignees, however, has been studied mainly from the ocean shipping lines perspective, focusing on the delivery of containers between ports. Container terminal operators provide loading/unloading services to/from ocean shipping lines and inland transporters. Inland transporters deliver containers between ports and warehouses in the case of Less Container Loaded (LCL), and between ports and final destinations (i.e. consignees), in the case of Full Container Loaded (FCL). Multimodal container transport services between shippers and consignees remain fragmented amongst the specialised service providers (Ducruet and Van der Horst, 2009). Furthermore, inland transporters often provide inventory management services through their own warehouses in the global supply chain. The modelling of the global logistics network needs to integrate both maritime shipping and inland transport into a combined perspective, taking into account the whole management of multimodal container transport between shippers and consignees. This chapter focuses on the practical manner of multimodal container transport chain, especially from a viewpoint of cross-border logistics in the hinterland.}

Recent trends in urban design and traffic engineering are reviewed and the implications for city logistics are outlined. Measures to improve the streetscape and air quality are favoring the greater use of electric vehicles. The role of urban consolidation centers to transfer inbound cargo from large vehicles suitable for intercity use to smaller, quieter, “greener” vehicles for intracity pickup and delivery is described. The emergence of omnichannel retail is changing shopping behavior and widening the range of last mile delivery options to include “click & collect” from stores, delivery to a locker, car boot delivery, in-home delivery, and conventional home delivery. Construction logistics is benefitting from better planning, off-site consolidation centers and, potentially, electric heavy goods vehicles. The significant benefits offered to city logistics by public transport are discussed. Finally the advantages for city logistics and a more sustainable urban environment of a move to a more circular economy, such as that being strived for in Amsterdam, are described.}

In this paper, the management problem of pharmaceutical reverse supply chain (PRSC) is studied, where the producer, the third party logistics company (3 PL) and the government are jointly involved in recycling the leftover pharmaceutical to make a trade-off among economic, environmental and social benefits. Different from the existing models, this paper formulates such a management problem as an integrated nonlinear bi-level programming (NBLP) model, where the producer is the leader, the 3 PL company is the follower, and the government encourages donation of pharmaceuticals and more pharmaceuticals to be recycled by subsidy and tax deduction. In our model, the recovered quantity depends on incentives and service-level of the 3 PL, and the producer as the leader pays the recovery fee to the 3 PL by taking into account heterogeneity of pharmaceuticals. To solve this complicated model, we first convert the lower-level optimization model into parametric complementarity constraints, the original model then is further transformed into a series of standard smooth problems by a partially smoothing method. An efficient algorithm is developed to find an equilibrium solution of the NBLP model. Case study and sensitivity analysis demonstrate that the proposed method in this paper can efficiently provide optimal policies for the complicated pharmaceutical recovery system, and a number of important managerial implications are revealed: (1) The unit sale price of pharmaceuticals, the 3 PL’s capacity and the tax deduction of the government can generate different impacts on the profits and the optimal collected quantities of the leftover pharmaceuticals. (2) Classification recycle of the pharmaceuticals is important to the scientific management of reverse supply chain. (3) The developed model and algorithm can efficiently improve sustainability of the recycle system of pharmaceuticals.}

abstract = {The sharing economy concept – an extension of the internet of things concept - has contributed to the emergence of a new paradigm of freight transportation, where the main players are puppet masters in controlling data and not only physical assets. This new economic model is based on the use of technology to allow companies, citizens and other actors to share and monetize the excess capacity of their assets (vehicles, houses, parking spaces, etc.). The potential effects of this model are difficult to quantify, but it has been ventured that this new economic relationship will yield greater efficiency to businesses across the world, especially in the supply chain and city logistics processes. Such prospect relies on the fact that it is based on the provision of opportunities to monetize resources that already exist, instead of creating additional infrastructures in order to meet the demand. In this context, the application of the shared economy model to logistics brings up concepts of logistics sharing capacity. Logistics sharing capacity assumes the access and sharing of operational capabilities, either by vehicle sharing, by vehicle capacity sharing, sharing warehousing or infrastructure sharing. The potential of logistic sharing solutions and respective transport capabilities to reduce emissions and mitigate the transport sector's impacts on climate change comes along with benefits to companies with the reduction of overall operating expenses, by reducing transport costs per kilogram and cutting maintenance and personnel costs, as fewer assets are needed. To the public sector, the benefits are still mostly felt in terms of environment as a consequence of the more effective use of resources. In fact, in spite the recent emergence of logistics sharing solutions, the topic has not been sufficiently explored under a perspective that: a) highlights the role that municipalities can play to benefit from the sharing economy model and; b) analyzes case studies in which municipalities provide owned assets to be shared by logistics players. The objective of this paper is to contribute to reduce that hiatus on research by assessing the impact of logistic sharing solutions under a public good perspective. Therefore, the paper analyses the potential impacts of promoting the shared usage of logistic parking infrastructure owned by public authorities. As a demonstration of that potential, the possible benefits of sharing parking spaces dedicated to urban logistics operations by other users were studied, in particular the parents taking children to kindergartens located in the area. The paper is supported by a case study carried out in a Portuguese city and the effects are quantified in metrics of transport performance, energy and environmental criteria. The scenario is compared to a baseline situation (BAU) and results show significant reductions in delay times, travel times, queue lengths and stopped times and increases in average speeds. Also, fuel consumption and emissions present considerable reductions in the tested scenario. As a result, the paper concludes that municipalities can take advantage of a sharing economy context, in which logistics sharing solutions can be exploited, by using their assets in a joint and more effective way. Those benefits are translated into the reduction of externalities and improvement of the quality of life in the city and, therefore, municipalities benefit from playing an active role in the emergent context of a sharing economy.}

This study develops a cooperative 2E-PDP with state–space–time network (C2E-PDPSST) and incorporates vehicle routing problem and profit allocation optimization. Transportation resource sharing (trucks/vehicles) is presented as a major cooperative strategy in C2E-PDPSST to reduce the number of vehicles and improve resource utilization. A bi-objective mixed integer model is proposed to minimize total operating costs and number of vehicles and is formulated based on state–space–time networks. A novel methodology, which combines the time-dependent forward dynamic programming algorithm and a hybrid heuristic algorithm comprising modified k-means clustering algorithm and improved multi-objective particle swarm optimization (IMOPSO) algorithm, is designed for solving C2E-PDPSST. The clustering process speeds up the solution by reducing the computational complexity. The IMOPSO algorithm combines inter- and intra-route operations to find the Pareto optimal solutions with predefined iteration and termination rules. The inter-route operations will improve the population diversity, while the intra-route operations will generate an optimal solution for each vehicle route. Thus, an effective combination of local and global solution search can be achieved. Profit allocation schemes are investigated using the criteria of minimum cost remaining savings. Our results on benchmark instances show that the proposed IMOPSO has better computational performance than the conventional MOPSO and multi-objective genetic algorithm. A case study based on the realistic logistics network in Chengdu City, China is conducted for validation. The proposed methodology considering state–space–time network performs better in terms of reducing traveling costs, and improving the flexibility and efficiency of the entire network.}

In this study, a framework is suggested to reuse the variety of household appliances to reduce municipal solid waste and help the low-income families. A single-objective mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model with uncertainty in the number of the products used by consumers is presented to optimize the reverse logistics network. The designed logistic network considered different recycling options such as recycling and repair and the centers called charity. In order to show the functionality of the presented model, a numerical example is solved by GAMS software to obtain the network structure with the optimum cost. The results confirm the applicability of the model by offering a great number of used products that can be transported and reused by affordable cost.}

Despite the researches and technological progress, it is still not possible to predict when or where the natural disaster will occur beforehand. Natural disasters cause severe loss of lives and damages. In addition, they cause physical, financial, social and environmental losses. Pre-disaster, during disaster and post-disaster activities are significant in order to decrease the losses caused by natural disasters. This study is about one of the pre-disaster activities. In the pre-disaster management process, a new activity is being tried in Turkey. Called "Neighborhood Disaster Stations", containers filled with emergency relief items such as medicines, painkillers, antiseptics and canned goods are located at the different predetermined locations. It is important to keep items in these stations usable at all times. Since these commodities have expiration dates, they need to be replenished periodically in order to remain useable at any time. The proper time for the replenishment should be determined by considering the probability of reselling or re-using the commodities with the maximum return as much as possible. However, replenishing frequently will result in large operational costs. Therefore, there is a trade-off between routing costs and replenishment. We propose a novel mixed integer-programming model in order to solve this problem. The proposed model determines the replenishment policy for each commodity in the containers and generates the route of each vehicle within a given planning horizon. The objective of this study is to maximize the total profit, which is the difference between expected revenue from reselling and the transportation cost for total routing costs for time periods in the planning horizon. The model determines the replenishment date of each commodity in each disaster container and provides optimal route for each vehicle within planning horizon. The proposed mixed integer programming model is solved optimally for a small instance in IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio 12.8 and validation of the model is done.}

Based on the high repeatability of vehicle routing, an energy management strategy is proposed to optimize hydrogen consumption on the premise of ensuring the stability of operation process. To improve the proton exchange membrane fuel cell output characteristics, the maximum power point tracking method based on conductance increment is used, and then the maximum power point, which is seared at the first time, is corrected again by simulated annealing algorithm. The power output control system of Li-ion battery pack based on dynamic programming is also designed. The state variables, control variables, constraint functions, objective functions and cost functions of the drive system are designed according to the related parameters such as vehicle gear change, demand torque and state-of-charge of Li-ion battery pack. The principle of equivalent hydrogen consumption is used to measure the energy output of Li-ion battery, and the fuzzy logic controller is used to simplify the expression of system state and control variables. Finally, the optimal output power sequence of Li-ion battery is calculated. And the experimental results show that after dynamic programming optimization, the driving system can ensure the stable operation of logistics vehicles and greatly reduce the consumption of hydrogen. These results can provide reference for energy management of other types of vehicles driven by proton exchange membrane fuel cell hybrid power system.}

Although there are numerous studies focusing on this issue, in literature little attention has been devoted to the impact of the initiative on the performances of Italian firms involved in agribusiness. In order to bridge this gap, this paper focuses on wine as a high-quality commodity exported all over the world and considered an epitome of Made in Italy. Furthermore, ports of Venice and Trieste was selected for the analyses as being part of BRI agreements. This study highlights that the BRI project may modify land use planning as a consequence of the policymakers’ choosing a specific port to serve as the Italian connection to the BRI. The heterogeneity that might influence regional data needs the usage of specific approaches (the order-α and order-m) to evaluate the firms’ efficiency as a consequence of two different links to the ports of Trieste and Venice. The authors attempt to perform this investigation considering the predicted effects of the BRI, and several different databases are used to examine these potential effects. The evaluation of accessibility in terms of distance and transport time could provide helpful details to policymakers when looking at different BRI alternatives. To achieve the analysis, the authors also consider dimensions connected to specific financial statements and labour, environmental and business innovation indicators. The results reveal that, when the scenario involves a specific port, some differences appear in the ranking of firms. The findings also show that the spatial effect connected to the choice of a specific port decreases for small firms. Since the Italian agribusiness sector – specifically the wine sector – is characterized by a prevalence of small and/or family firms, it is recommended that policymakers deal with the conclusions of present research to compare different BRI options from a land use point of view.}

abstract = {The Bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE) Blinatumomab and CD19-specific Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell products are approved for the treatment of relapsed and refractory B-cell neoplasms. However, these T-cell based immunotherapies can be accompanied by immune-related toxicities differing from adverse events of classical cytotoxic agents. Toxicity management can pose a challenge for health care professionals. Additionally, logistics of CAR T-cell patient management, particularly with regard to timelines of apheresis, bridging therapies, and CAR T-cell transfusion, require coordinated efforts between referring physicians and treatment centers. To support the optimal management of these patients, we developed an interactive smartphone application (“myTcell”) which educates physicians in the pre-treatment logistics of CARs and BiTEs and provides recommendations on management and treatment of immune-related toxicities. We initiated a multi-step content development process with an extensive literature research of toxicity guidelines consented by the ASTCT, SITC, NCCN and EBMT as well as of officially released drug information. Findings were integrated in an information platform to provide diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations as well as algorithms for interactive toxicity grading tools. We could successfully implement an app (“myTcell”) guiding health workers in a disease- and product-specific step by step process through the clinical workflow of CAR and BiTE therapy (Fig.1). This includes recommendations for eligibility, patient screening, safety assessment and stopping rules prior to leukapheresis and CAR T-cell transfusion. Upon entering relevant clinical data for grading of CRS, ICANS and HLH, interactive tools display toxicity grade and grade-specific management (Fig. 2). Further, “myTcell” assists with the diagnosis and treatment of pancytopenia and infections. The app includes an overview of important publications with direct links to respective abstracts to support evidence-based decision-making. A prototype was validated at five Geman treatment centers through a questionnaire which measured the advantage of the app compared to common clinical practice. 38 physicians with a median working experience of 8 years validated the app protoype in a real-world setting of CAR T-cells or BiTE application for the treatment of Diffuse Large-B-Cell Lymphoma (89.5%) and B-Cell Precursor Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (39.5%) at five German treatment centers (University Hospitals of LMU Munich, Cologne, Göttingen, Erlangen, Tübingen). 78.9% of the users most valued the content of toxicity management. In addition, 63.2% reported to dominantly use the interactive tools and calculators to assess severity of toxicities and to instantly receive grade-specific management recommendations. As expected, the tools were most frequently used for the two most commonly occurring side effects CRS (68.4%) and ICANS (65.8%). In addition, most of the users agreed, that the interactive tools improved toxicity management (94.7%) and saved time during their clinical practice (81.6%). Based on these results, “myTcell” has been certified as a medicinal product class I and has been released in the app stores and for desktop application (www.mytcell.de) on July 15, 2021. “myTcell” is a smartphone app supporting the use of T-cell based immunotherapy platforms. The app supports assessment and treatment of novel CAR T and BITE mediated immunotoxicities. Health care professionals validated feasibility and in particular appreciated fast and easy assessment of toxicity grading and management. Thus, “myTcell” is a tool that has the potential to improve guideline adherence and accelerate broader and safer application of CARs and BiTEs based immunotherapy. Figure 1

The drinks distribution system considered here uses glass bottles for soft drinks to deliver to all customers who need soft drinks in glass bottles, before making any pickups of empty glass bottles from clients to return to the company. This study aims at both an integer linear programming formulation and a novel hybrid differential evolution algorithm involving a genetic operator with fuzzy logic controller, for solving the multi-trip vehicle routing problem with backhauls and a heterogeneous fleet. The objective function is to minimize total cost, which is related to distance travelled. For validation, we designed numerical experiments to compare the proposed approaches with LINGO computational software, using the conventional differential evolution algorithm and differential evolution with selected genetic operator and fuzzy logic controller in real settings. The experimental results demonstrate the practical viability of the proposed approaches.}

abstract = {Port logistics is characterised by a high degree of fragmentation, uncertainty and complexity. In a context with these characteristics, decision support can be of significant value. This study presents the prototype of an intelligent decision support system (DSS) that leads to horizontal and vertical cooperation among freight agents involved in port logistics. A multi-agent simulation model is presented where heterogeneous actions are enabled as a result of an adaptive reinforcement learning algorithm that is inspired by human decision-making strategies. The model combines optimisation modelling and decision theory to operate in a dynamic environment characterised by information asymmetry among agents and dynamic changes over time. A simulation demonstrates the dynamics and convergence to equilibrium of the interactions of heterogeneous agents for delivery and pick up of import/export shipments. In particular, we answer two specific research questions. What is the likely impact of an intelligent DSS in hinterland container transport as a value-added service of port community system (PCS)? How can an optimum cooperative strategy be formulated to meet the dynamic demand and supply of freight agents in hinterland container transport and achieve agility in the age of hyper-competition? By addressing these two research questions we make a specific contribution by developing an agent-based simulation model in a real-world and large-scale case study, by using a reinforcement learning model based on probability matching theory that allows simulating realistically the adaptive behaviour of agents. The results of the simulation of two weeks of container movements indicate huge savings in total transport costs and distance travelled as well as higher utilisation of trucks from the sharing of resources. Moreover, we show that it is strictly better for smaller freight agents to cooperate – a conclusion generated endogenously inside the model as a trade-off between exploration and exploitation. As a result of this prototype simulation, major freight agents will not necessarily benefit from the DSS mainly because they are already using the economies of scale.}

We consider the design of a logistic solution in developing, politically, and military sensitive regions. Thus, we analyse the supply chains that deliver goods (electrical cables) to Iraq. The decision problem involves the selection of suppliers combined with the intuitive/ heuristic design of transportation logistic corridors. This joint decision problem (suppliers’ selection and logistics corridors design) is formulated as a multiple criteria ranking problem and solved with the application of the Multiple Criteria Decision Making/ Aiding (MCDM/A) methodology. Our approach is based on thorough analysis of the decision situation (internal and external conditions; decision makers, stakeholders; specific local constraints; existing expectations and preferences). We take into account the trade-offs and constraints (economic, political, social) to reach a compromise and most desirable solution. We carry out a series of computational experiments with the application of selected MCDM/A ranking methods, e.g. ELECTRE III/IV and AHP. We develop a universal decision model and adapt it to specific local circumstances and characteristic features of the applied decision tools, i.e. ELECTRE III/IV and AHP methods. We take into account the concept of sustainability in our analyses.}

Further, the reconstruction of the end-of-life-buildings is the vital step for the preparedness to earthquakes. Therefore, this study aims to mitigate the effect of earthquakes by reconstructing end-of-life-buildings and developing plans on recycling the debris occurs during the demolition processes. Since Turkey survived several earthquakes, the government started a project to reconstruct end-of-life-buildings located on the seismically active zones. With this motivation, a stochastic MILP model is developed to design a reverse logistic network for end-of-life-buildings’ debris. In the worst case, in total, 447063915 tons of debris is anticipated to occur, and 20 different cases are developed and analyzed to determine the best plan for Istanbul. Based on the results and sensitivity analysis, the best strategy is determined as setting up an extra landfilling area and transferring 80% of the debris from demolition sites to recycling centers and increasing the capability of the recycling centers to be able to process 90% of the debris arrive at the centers. By applying this strategy, the costs could be reduced by 98%. The developed framework is the first study that considers debris management as a preparedness stage to earthquakes, and the proposed model is easily can be applied to any region in the world, given that the parameters are revised because each region or country has its unique dynamics.}

By this, we are adding further insights to the concept of the logistics sprawl. For the region of Berlin–Brandenburg, we show that apart from the sprawl of logistics locations, there is a concentration of these locations in suburban regions. We applied classical concentration measures on data of companies in the WZ-2008 group 52.1 Warehousing and storage. Regarding the entire study area, medium-sized logistics companies are relatively more common than within the overall economy, whereas small logistics companies are relatively less numerous. In addition, large logistics companies are significantly more frequent in the suburbs of Berlin. This may indicate a fundamental structural difference of the logistics branch that is common to all regions from urban to rural, accompanied by a second overlapping concentration pattern that is most dominant in the suburbs and appears particularly for large logistics companies. The concentration of these logistics locations is higher in the surrounding area of Berlin than in the City of Berlin itself as well as in other areas of Brandenburg. Analysis of these logistics locations by Kernel density analysis revealed hotspots of the concentration around the City of Berlin in the suburban region of Brandenburg, dominated by a cluster in the south of Berlin.}

This study aims to optimize the logistics network and transportation system of ISWM where the complete chain of MSW/residue is formulated as a tri-echelon ISWM logistics network. Assuming various levels of complexity of a realistic ISWM system, a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model is developed to formulate the ISWM system in the framework of the Fleet Size and Mix Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows. Addressing uncertainty in ratios of MSW generation, a two-stage stochastic optimization approach is proposed to effectively support the cost-effective ISWM transportation system by determining the optimal fleet size and decomposition, vehicles routes and capacity-allocation to the system components. The proposed approach successfully was applied to a real case of ISWM in southern Tehran, Iran. The numerical experiments showed the usefulness of the approach to minimize the economic costs of the system under uncertainty. Furthermore, the results verified the strength and effectiveness of the method when experiencing larger deviations between the estimated and actual amounts of the uncertain parameter and in cases of unplanned disruptions in the system network.}

To this goal, many companies are evaluating the possibility of opening urban satellites close to retail stores. Urban satellites can assure a number of daily replenishments larger than one at the retail stores. However, opening urban satellites requires expensive capital expenditures and can increase transportation costs. In this paper, we investigate the impact of urban satellites on the service level, inventory and transportation costs of fast fashion supply chains. Discrete event simulation is used to assess the value that urban satellites can provide to fast fashion supply chains. The application to an Italian retailer case study reveals that the increased transportation and storage costs may be compensated by increased sales as a result of a wider product assortment at the retail stores. The case study simulation results are proposed as possible lessons for other fast fashion last mile distribution systems.}

The IoT is gradually being adopted by several industries, bringing about major advancements in the accuracy, integrity, and security of their products and services. The pharmaceutical industry is one such industry where a lack of precision and inaccuracy can be fatal to its consumers, hence it needs to be ensured that incoming raw materials, processing, and the outgoing drugs and equipments are critically examined before being dispatched from the production warehouse. The IoT can certainly help solve this issue to a great extent. With the advent of the IoT, the pharmaceutical industry has been revolutionized as it facilitates efficiency in production, supply chain, logistics, and regulatory compliance. In the pharma industry there is always a risk of changes to environmental conditions which might harm the integrity of drugs, need regulating for the availability of stocks to avoid shortages, and making sure that the packaged drug has been received by the required customer. To ensure that the industry is safe from such recurring challenges, the IoT is being employed in manufacturing, warehouse management, and even shipment and tracking, to solve the age-old problems in this industry. In this chapter, we first cover the basics of the IoT and its applications in logistics and the supply chain. We also discuss the growth of the pharmaceutical industry, with a focus on the introduction of the IoT and how it has changed the face of pharma. The applications of the IoT in pharmaceutical logistics such as quality control, shipment tracking, and drug development are also discussed. The challenges faced in the industry and how they are being overcome with the IoT are also described. The aim of this chapter is to give readers an understanding of how the pharma industry has seen a technological boom with the IoT and how this has made the entire process, from drug development to shipment, extremely efficient and secure.}

The effective ALNS is designed to solve large-scale problems integrating the mechanical harvester assignment problem (HAP) and the mechanical harvester routing problem (HRP). The newly developed destroy and repair methods are unique and effective. Additionally, four new formulas have been developed to calculate the probability to accept the worse solution using linear and parabola functions instead of the exponential function that is used mostly in the literature. The numerical results show that the parabola function, which uses the information about the solution quality, outperforms all other proposed heuristics. This demonstrates that the proposed heuristics are very efficient and are not only useful for reducing the infield operations costs of small growers, but also for efficient management of the inbound logistics equipment and machinery of the sugarcane supply system.}

abstract = {Auctions are an important method for solving the logistics procurement problem in electronics markets. However, current auction methods rarely consider the existence of quantity discounts. To fill this research gap, we introduce quantity discounts into the procurement Vickrey–Clark–Groves (P-VCG) and truthful double-auction mechanisms and apply them to the logistics services procurement market. For a market with only one customer, we design a P-VCG auction with quantity discounts, and for a market with multiple customers, we construct a model for maximizing social welfare and propose a trade reduction with a quantity discount (TR-QD) double-auction mechanisms. We prove that both auction mechanisms ensure incentive compatibility, individual rationality, balanced budget, and asymptotical efficiency. Furthermore, compared with traditional truthful double-auctions, the TR-QD mechanism supports cooperative purchases—which allows more customers to enjoy discounts on large-scale logistics services—and bid time priority—which achieves the goal of meeting earlier requests earlier and improves auction efficiency. Numerical studies further show that the TR-QD auction mechanism can achieve an increase in customers’ total value, logistics companies’ total value, social welfare and total trading volume.}

abstract = {Reducing the non-working distance for agricultural vehicles is beneficial for reducing the total operational costs for farmers. In this study, we optimize the non-working distance in intra- and inter-fields simultaneously for harvesters while harvesting rice. A mixed integer programming is presented for optimizing the rice harvesting problem, where a similar working time for all harvesters are considered based on a real case. Besides, in this model, two kinds of fields, namely moist and non-moist fields are considered, where the first can only be harvested by crawler harvesters while the second can be harvested by any type of harvester. This model aims to find an optimal schedule for the harvesters. A hybrid algorithm using both adaptive large neighborhood search and tabu search techniques is implemented to optimize the problem. A case study is considered to verify the performance of the hybrid algorithm. The results indicate that the hybrid algorithm is an effective method for solving the rice harvesting problem because the total non-working distance could be improved significantly by 15.3%. The proportion of moist fields is analyzed because it influences the schedule significantly. When compared to the traditional method for optimizing the non-working distance for harvesters, the total non-working distance in this method could be reduced by 6.2%. This paper provides farmers with a general framework for reducing the non-working distance in intra- and inter-field logistics, which results in a more efficient performance of the harvesters in the fields.}

abstract = {This paper presents an integrated strategic-tactical planning model for the sugar beet supply chain problem. The model includes the critical agricultural and industrial decisions coupled with the transportation of crops by capacitated vehicles from farms to the processing facilities. In the agricultural stage, the proposed model is used to analyze both agronomic and operational constraints for achieving a sustainable farming system through feasible strategic crop rotation plans. These plans integrate crop sequences with temporal and spatial variations while considering the known seasonal demand. The agricultural decisions involve crops planting and harvesting decisions to fulfill both fresh produce crops and processing demands. In the industrial stage, the key decisions include aggregate production plans for processing the harvested beet, as well as managing the shipping and storage of these agro-materials in the production facility. In this paper, a binary integer programming model is formulated with the objective of minimizing the overall operational cost including transportation and inventory of processed and non-processed beets. A unique time dimension was added to the planning horizon to allow crop rotation planning between different cropping seasons. A realistic case is used to test the formulated model and elaborate its complexity.}

Possible advantages are relevant, such as increasing overall production efficiency and product variety as well as reducing responsiveness and lead times. This paper focuses on the architectures and dynamics of productive-demanding nodes in a Scattered Manufacturing (SM) Network, with an application in Additive Manufacturing scenarios. SM allows launching production orders everywhere anytime inside the domain of the network. These autonomous nodes can rely on on-demand manufacturing services by sharing resources in a geographically distributed network. One possible approach is the introduction of a platform to coordinate the dynamics along the network according to principles of sustainability, equated shared resources and transparency by managing communication activities among nodes. To identify variables/factors that affect the system, a unique model is proposed by combining different perspectives, which focus on: a) decomposition and localization of demanding node’s order into subtasks of variable size; b) tasks allocation criteria among geographically distributed nodes; c) logistics issues related to the localization of productive nodes. In particular, the model, with the aim of optimizing the overall manufacturing and logistics costs, suggests either logistics paths along the sub-network or tasks assignment criteria and scheduling in geographically distributed nodes.}

Moreover, they sell not only clothes but also accessories such as bags and shoes, adding to their number of products. Product life cycle is extremely short, generally one season. Also, products are mainly sold during first a few weeks of a season, and because trends change quickly in textile industry, it is difficult for manufacturers to anticipate what is required by customers in time to meet demand, creating shortages or large quantities of unsold products. When unsold products cannot be sold to other channels, it leads to disposal. One of the reasons for excessive disposal is that the distributor miss timing of shipments from the logistics warehouse to the stores. To reduce shortage, Tanaka et al. (2018) used sales information to develop a method to determine shipment timing. However, they did not decide shipment timing considering shortages and disposal simultaneously. This study aims to support distributors' decision-making by analyzing inventory data of logistics warehouse. For that purpose, this study proposes a method to reduce shortages and disposal of products, and introduce an evaluation index. First, appropriate shipping timing are forecast. Then, an evaluation index clarifies how cost varies when considering only shortage and when considering both shortage and disposal.}

The system is underpinned by a discrete-time mathematical model that incorporates features such as multiple crops, moisture management, yield loss, quality downgrades due to adverse weather events, and quality optimization through blending. The output variables from the mathematical model include the total yield of each crop, the duration required to complete the harvest, and the transport and storage costs. The model is validated via test simulations using data that reflects typical farming scenarios in Western Australia. The results show that with on-farm storage, harvest duration and yield losses decrease and the total yield increases, leading to more profit for farmers.}

Service composition is an essential issue as well as an important technique in cloud manufacturing (CMfg) that supports construction of larger-granularity, value-added services by combining a number of smaller-granularity services to satisfy consumers’ complex requirements. Meta-heuristics algorithms such as genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, and ant colony algorithm are frequently employed for addressing service composition issues in cloud manufacturing. These algorithms, however, require complex design flows and painstaking parameter tuning, and lack adaptability to dynamic environment. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) provides an alternative approach for solving cloud manufacturing service composition (CMfg-SC) issues. DRL as model-free artificial intelligent methods enables a system to learn optimal service composition solutions through training, which can therefore circumvent the aforementioned problems with meta-heuristics algorithms. This paper is dedicated to exploring possible applications of DRL in CMfg-SC. A logistics-involved QoS-aware DRL-based CMfg-SC is proposed. A dueling Deep Q-Network (DQN) with prioritized replay named PD-DQN is designed as the DRL algorithm. Effectiveness, robustness, adaptability, and scalability of PD-DQN are investigated, and compared with that of the basic DQN and Q-learning. Experimental results indicate that PD-DQN is able to effectively address the CMfg-SC problem.}

In Brazil, the principles that underpin the National Solid Waste Policy (PNRS) are consistent with those used by developed countries, namely, the polluter-payer and protector-receiver; cooperation among the different spheres of government, the business sector, and other societal segments; and the shared product life-cycle responsibility (Brasil, 2010a; Novi et al., 2013; Santos et al., 2019). In the latter, selective collection and reverse logistics systems are the primary instruments (Zhang et al., 2011). Thus, the general objective of this work is to compare the technical and economic feasibility of four different sectorial agreements for reverse logistics implemented in Brazil. The specific objective is to describe the possible conflicts of interest of the multistakeholders. The sources of evidence used in this multi-case study were interviews, observations, and documentary research in the period from 2016 to 2018. The first result demonstrated that the economic viability of reverse logistics systems are obtained when the wastes have a commercial value after consumption (packaging and consumer electronics) or when industries organize to charge a fee that covers the costs of recycling and transport (lamps and medicines). The second result shows that there are many stakeholders involved in this process: manufacturers and importers, consumers, private waste and recycling companies, and government represented by municipalities, the Ministry of the Environment (MMA), and state environmental agencies (OEMAs). Each one has different interests and responsibilities: government has to preserve the environment and comply with international agreements on climate change, thus creating laws that ultimately burden companies and cities; profit-maximizing companies evaluate these rules as additional costs in their operations, whereas cities, in which operations are conducted, have low financial and managerial capacity. The stakeholder map reveals that there are overlapping roles among agents, with some being the same for all chains, and the constructed power and level of interest matrix indicates the importance of the process to be conducted by the state to align economic and social-environmental interests.}

However, crash fatality rate has considerably remained high until recent year, indicating a clear need for further related research. Considering severity of the crashes, the majority of fatal crashes involved the motorcycle road user. Therefore, motorcycle crashes are important issues and should be considered to mitigate fatality due to immoderate proportion of motorcycle road user and motorcyclist fatality. This study aims to identify factors that influence the severity of motorcycle accidents on Thailand's arterial roads by employing ordered logistic regression and multiple correspondence analysis. The results demonstrated that although both analyses were relatively different, they provided similar results. Age, road lanes, and helmet wearing were significant factors that influenced the severity of motorcycle accidents. The results could serve as reference for planning strategies or organizing campaigns to reduce and prevent death owing to road traffic accidents, which may enhance the overall image of road traffic safety in Thailand.}

abstract = {The aim of the article is to analyse and reflect upon the process and outcome of a potential clash between urban biodiversity and road transport interests in the Swedish city of Örebro, as a case of planning in the face of conflict. Combining an application of multilevel governance theory with negotiation planning and narrative method, it examines the siting of a huge warehouse and “logistics centre” at the edge of a Natura 2000 site on the outskirts of the city. Despite the city’s ambitious environmental goals and sustainability profile, the local authority decided to offer the company a site adjacent to a wetland area intended for preserving and developing biodiversity. After an intervention by the central state County Administrative Board [länsstyrelsen], the local authority had to implement certain security measures, and also reserve an additional, large natural land area to compensate for the threats to the Natura 2000 site. Before the final decision was made, a series of negotiations occurred between the involved actors, mainly the local authority, the multinational Sonepar Group/Elektroskandia and the County Administrative Board, and the case is a fruitful target for a multifaceted analysis illuminating the tension between the goals of preserving urban biodiversity and promoting road transport and urban growth. It also offers an inside view of the negotiation and planning process. The key issue is how the siting of a potentially hazardous, transport intensive national warehouse in a city renowned for its high environmental-protection profile was possible. Considering Sweden’s high-profile regarding sustainability, the selected case also offers food for reflection on the potentials and barriers of implementing ecological modernization more generally. The lessons learned from an examination of the local authority’s attempt to harmonize such diverse policy priorities as urban biodiversity and intensive road transport for economic growth, on a site adjacent to a Natura 2000 wetlands area, may help enable urban planners and scholars to find creative policy solutions, avoid causing damage to biodiversity, and increase ecosystem values in terms of residents’ and other visitors’ experience and understanding of nature. However, at the end of the article we address the question of whether our empirical conclusion is not “too good to be true”, and raise concerns regarding the intricate relationship between sustainability and resilience; the systemic power exerted by the global Sonepar Group/Elektroskandia; and the potentials and limits of public negotiation planning.}

This shift in the trend of commerce to online platforms generates additional packages and parcels. Also, a collection of returned goods is becoming an issue of concern for sustainability, especially in urban areas. This problem of returning of goods gives rise to the concept of reverse logistics. The purpose of this research is to suggest crowdshipping measures via a proposed analytical framework for addressing the logistical gaps in interior regions while simultaneously producing co-benefits by reducing the emissions. The rapid urbanization offers both challenges and opportunities to policymakers not only in the creation of a transportation design and logistics systems for freight but also provides scope for reduction in logistics charges. In this paper, the analytical framework is being proposed to provide a sustainable solution since it can concurrently decrease the shipping costs, takes lesser time, generates lesser pollutants, and also reduces traffic congestion in a city. Crowdshipping is the concept of a supply chain in which the closest (or shortest) route is selected for delivery of products via the interested crowd.

abstract = {This paper aims at deepening the knowledge about the traits and characteristics of the evolution of the intermodality quest in Italy by carrying on two distinct as well as correlated benchmark analyses. The first is performed on the approaches resulting by the Port Authorities (PAs) of Centre-Northern Italy and the second on the schemes adopted by the PAs of Southern Italy. The context of the analysis is characterized by the growing power of alliances, the vast diffusion of Ultra-Large Container Vessels both in container and Ro/Ro markets and the need for port systems to act in a logic of transport integration and sustainability. PAs of Center-Northern Italy have developed an active role in the transition to intermodality, promoting the participation in railways companies, focusing on the digitalization and integration with hinterlands. We show that the role of these PAs has proved fundamental in the acceleration of the process and there are various best practices that could be replicated in other contexts. PAs of Southern Italy's role, instead, is being hampered by the lack of suitable infrastructures, therefore their role has a different nature than in Center-Northern Italy. Southern Italy's PAs are also at the heart of various policies of fiscal incentives promoted by local and national governments, e.g. Special Economic Zones and Logistics Integrated Areas. Nonetheless, we show how they have been less effective in contrasting the growing power of other Mediterranean ports and have not been able to extend and diversify their port activities. The results of this work point in the direction of a more integrated cooperation between PAs and local and national governments, but also highlight that PAs alone cannot pursue such a complex transition in today's competitive market. Nevertheless, the current role of PAs in Italy has been reformed in 2016, therefore suggesting to treat results of this work as preliminary and in need of further research especially on the potential collaboration between public authorities and private operators. The work concludes with some food for thoughts and policy implications.}

We assessed the availability, forecasting and supply chain logistics for rabies PEP in Kenya, compared with the system used for vaccines in the expanded program of immunization (routine vaccines). Semi-structured questionnaires capturing data on forecasting, procurement, distribution, cold chain and storage, monitoring and reporting for routine vaccines and rabies vaccines and RIG were administered to 35 key personnel at the national, county, sub-county and health facility levels in five counties. Results showed large variability in PEP availability (stockouts ranged from 3 to 36 weeks per year) with counties implementing rabies elimination activities having shorter stockouts. PEP is administered intramuscularly using the 5-dose Essen regimen (day 0, 3, 7, 14 and 28). PEP costs to bite patients were reported to range from 10 to 15 US dollars per dose; RIG was seldom available. A less robust supply and logistics infrastructure is used for rabies PEP compared to routine vaccines. Forecasting and monitoring mechanisms for rabies PEP was poor in the study counties. The supply of vaccines from the national to the sub-national level is mainly through two government agencies and a private agency. Since government decentralization, the National Vaccine and Immunization Program has remained as the main supplier of the routine vaccines, playing a lesser role in the supply of rabies biologicals. Adoption of the dose-saving intradermal route for PEP administration, reduction of PEP costs to patients, and placing rabies vaccines within the routine vaccines supply and logistics system would significantly improve PEP availability and accessibility to persons at risk of rabies; a critical step to achieving elimination of human deaths from rabies.}

However, vehicles on port terminals are also parked in multi-story car parks where GPS is not available. Common indoor positioning methods like Wi-Fi fingerprinting or Cell of Origin techniques have considerable problems dealing with the dynamic environment, which is full of metal car bodies. This paper presents a localization technique based on Wi-Fi Round Trip Time (RTT), which should help to achieve robust positioning results. The proposed positioning technique is based on a geometric approach, which uses trilateration and a probabilistic approach based on the likelihood of the car’s position. As a result, it is shown that Wi-Fi RTT is an appropriate option for industrial indoor positioning in dynamic environments.}

abstract = {In this paper, we re-examine the exponential smoothing model in the context of its use in supply chain and logistics forecasting when supply chain or logistics costs are measured by the doubly linear (LINLIN) loss function of errors of demand forecasts. The parameters of our models are optimized with respect to the LINLIN loss, i.e., by applying the quantile regression estimator. The resulting forecasting procedures, which we call quantile smoothing, are then used to forecast the monthly microeconomic time series and the quarterly and annual sales data from the M3 forecast competition. According to accuracy measures for quantile predictions and in part also statistical tests of the forecasting results, the suggested procedures lead to better quantile forecasts than both standard econometric approaches and popular methods from the practice of logistics forecasting in the case of the longer among the microeconomic monthly data. On the contrary, for the other time series, the best outcomes are usually obtained through a simple modeling of the conditional median or mean, although quantile smoothing still remains among the best forecasting procedures. Moreover, the best performing quantile smoothing equation changes across quantiles.}

Strict time requirements must be incorporated during distribution planning to ensure delivery for safe, fresh, and high-quality agricultural products to customers. The special time is directly influenced by the maturity of agricultural products. The study established a maturity model of soluble solids for agricultural products based on ethephon concentration, temperature and storage time. The distribution model has been structured based on the ant colony algorithm to ensure agricultural product arrival at required time. The results showed that the maturity model largely depended on temperature and storage time instead of ethephon concentration. The correlation coefficient of the model R2 was 0.939, which proved the maturity model could predict the maturity degree accurately. Then bananas were delivered in the hands of customers at the required maturity through the distribution model effectively. The method is an effective way to optimize distribution lines for reducing logistics loss.}

Recently, 25 container warehouses are located in different cities in Turkey to deliver relief supplies to beneficiaries quickly. We take this existing situation as given and investigate if this investment could be utilised better. The available inventory (i.e., tents, beds, blankets) in these container warehouses is currently not used efficiently. Some warehouses store one type of item and none from other types. Therefore, several warehouses must be activated during a response operation to fully satisfy the beneficiaries’ needs for each relief item type. We aim to investigate the benefits of operating equivalent (i.e., a proper inventory level from each relief item type) warehouses while reallocating a total available inventory for better coordination. A location-reallocation type of mathematical model is tested with real-life data from past earthquakes. Three to eight container warehouses are recommended to be converted to an equivalent type. The results indicate potential savings for the proposed model, and this potential is more visible in large-scale demand instances than in small ones.}

abstract = {Demand for fresh food is increasing day by day as people want to consume healthy, quality and fresh vegetables and fruits. So, the main mission of supply chains is to deliver secure and fresh food overcoming postharvest losses. Fresh fig is a kind of perishable fruit with is very short durability period. Diversification of fresh fig market and its trade will strengthen the status of fresh fig in domestic and international markets. Post harvest storage and transport (logistics) conditions cause various damage and quality losses in fresh figs that continue to ripen. Therefore, factors such as storage temperature, humidity, transport containers, water losses due to mechanical damage and vibration of vehicles are important. This project was conducted in order to determine the most appropriate fresh fig varieties as an exportation alternative to “Bursa Siyahı” and to demonstrate changes in quality during storage and shelf-life periods after storage. “Siyah Orak”, “Goklop” and “1100” fig varieties at the Fig Research Institution in Aydın were used as materials. During harvest fruit were directly placed into their storage packages (into nespacks) and stored at 3 ± 1 °C for 20 days in cold storage condition. In addition, the samples taken from cold storage were kept for two days at 20 °C to determine their shelf-life periods. During the studies in 2012, 2013 and 2014 the following data was collected: weight loss during storage and shelf-life periods, firmness by texture analysis, total soluble solids, titratable acidity, maturity rate, pH, L, a, and b skin and flesh color values. During the studies on storage and shell-life period, it was shown that the fruit harvested at their coloring stages of 2/3 and 1/3 of hard-ripe fig variety was more durable than other varieties. It was also concluded that since the fruit harvested during the ripening period when 1/3 of their skin get colored are so small, they can be commercialized with different packaging materials.}

Following the stochastic severity of combinational disasters, the robust counterparts are derived against the ambiguous uncertainty of evacuee scales and transportation time, respectively. A customized progressive hedging algorithm based on the augmented Lagrangian relaxation is developed to solve the problem. We decompose the problem based on the scenario and iteratively solve the adaptively penalized sub-problems with decision variables independent of stages. The results of an illustrative example show that incorporating secondary disaster scenarios can contribute to improving relief coverage. The proposed algorithm is competitive with some benchmarks.}

abstract = {The persistent development towards decreasing batch sizes due to an ongoing product individualization, as well as increasingly dynamic market and competitive conditions lead to new changeability requirements in production environments. Since each of the individualized products might require different base materials or components and manufacturing resources, the paths of the products going through the factory as well as the required internal transport and material supply processes are going to differ for every product. Conventional planning and control systems, which rely on predefined processes and central decision-making, are not capable to deal with the arising system’s complexity along the dimensions of changing goods, layouts and throughput requirements. The concepts of “self-organization” in combination with “autonomous control” provide promising solutions to solve these new requirements by using among other things the potential of autonomous, decentralized and target-optimized decision-making. A major enabler for the development towards autonomous changeable intralogistics systems are intelligent logistical objects (e.g. smart products, bins and conveyor systems) which are able to communicate and interact with each other as well as with human workers. To investigate the potential of automation and human-robot collaboration for intralogistics, a research project for the development of a collaborative tugger train has been started at the ESB Logistics Learning Factory in line with various student projects in neighboring research areas. This collaborative tugger train system in combination with other manual (e.g. handcarts) and (semi-)automated conveyor systems (e.g. automated guided forklift) will be integrated into a dynamic, self-organized scenario with varying production batch sizes to develop a method for target-oriented self-organization and autonomous control of intralogistics systems. For a structured investigation of self-organized scenarios a generic intralogistics model as well as a criteria catalogue has been developed. The ESB Logistics Learning will serve as a practice-oriented research, validation and demonstration environment for these purposes.}

Subsequently, the methods of delivery of goods in relation to the type of goods and customer requirements were investigated. The most frequently offered ways of delivering goods to customers are delivery of goods to a stone shop or a post office. On the other hand, the least offered option is the delivery of goods to an external dispensing point.}
