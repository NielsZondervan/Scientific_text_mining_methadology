abstract = {To tackle the logistics challenges faced by enterprises using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) with human-driven vans for parcel deliveries, we introduce the two-echelon vehicle routing problem with time windows and mobile satellites (2E-VRP-TM), which, when solved, optimizes delivery routes for a fleet of van-UAV combinations. Typically, one van carries several UAVs. The first echelon involves time-window-driven parcel deliveries using vans from a distribution center (DC) to customers. The second echelon involves UAVs being dispatched from mobile-satellite vans to serve customers with time windows and directly delivering parcels from the DC. When the first-echelon vehicles park at customer locations and wait for second-echelon vehicle departures and returns, the first-echelon vehicles are used as mobile satellites. We develop a vehicle-flow formulation, in which the mobile-satellite synchronization constraints are included to ensure the echelon interaction. We provide an adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic. Computational experiments evaluate the validity of the 2E-VRP-TM formulation and the effectiveness of the heuristic.}

In the article the main tendencies in field of application of modern metal-ceramic materials for production, repair and operation of railway transport equipment are considered, modern directions in powder technologies and applied materials are shown, as well as possibilities of increasing reliability and safety of used powder parts. The basic properties and advantages of parts from powder materials are estimated. The possibilities of using powder details in various units of rolling stock are shown, as more reliable, safe and economically profitable. Among them: metal-powder slide bearings based on iron-copper, the main advantage of which is the presence of residual porosity, which contributes to the formation of a stable oil film in the bearing; bushings of valves of diesel motors, gears of oil and water pumps possessing high wear resistance; friction discs and brake pads designed to work in brakes and friction clutches in conditions of dry and liquid friction.}

Developments in industry and in logistics such as just-in-time manufacturing are now being applied to library acquisitions. This means that materials can be ordered when requested and delivered in a very short time (if not immediately). However, there are implications for this model of acquiring library material that have to be considered including review or mediation of requests, method of requesting, and the administrative and other non-purchase costs. Nonetheless, demand-driven acquisition shows yet another trend toward self-service in modern science libraries as collection development, a traditional library service, is turned over to one degree or another to the user.}

E-business gives value chains a high degree of organizational (outsourcing) and locational (offshoring) flexibility, and firms can purchase intermediate goods and business services on a global basis. The rise of e-business shapes the geography of work: tasks that process information are amenable to various forms of teleworking, at home, on travel, or in a coworking space. E-commerce is a subset of e-business, related to trade of goods and services. E-commerce is often defined as business-to-business (B2B), business-to-consumer (B2C), and consumer-to-consumer (C2C). China has surpassed United States as the leading market for both B2B and B2C e-commerce. E-commerce has revolutionized shopping: online merchants benefit from low costs of entry in the business and consumers have easy access to huge catalogues of products, without regard on their location. But distance still matters: logistics is at the nexus of e-commerce operations. The competition between ‘physical’ and online retail leads to the rise of multichannel forms of commerce. The foreseeable future of e-business and e-commerce will be shaped by the sophistication of digital technology: advanced algorithmic and artificial intelligence, big data analysis, and the Internet of things.}

In 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) flagged vaccine hesitancy as one of the top 10 threats to global health. The drivers of and barriers to under-vaccination include logistics (access to and awareness of affordable vaccines), as well as a complex mix of psychological, social, political, and cultural factors.
Increasing vaccine uptake
There is a need for effective strategies to increase vaccine uptake in various settings, based on the best available evidence. Fortunately, the field of vaccine acceptance research is growing rapidly with the development, implementation, and evaluation of diverse measurement tools, as well as interventions to address the challenging range of drivers of and barriers to vaccine acceptance.
Annual Vaccine Acceptance Meetings
Since 2011, the Mérieux Foundation has hosted Annual Vaccine Acceptance Meetings in Annecy, France that have fostered an informal community of practice on vaccination confidence and vaccine uptake. Mutual learning and sharing of knowledge has resulted directly in multiple initiatives and research projects. This article reports the discussions from the 7th Annual Vaccine Acceptance Meeting held September 23–25, 2019. During this meeting, participants discussed emergent vaccine acceptance challenges and evidence-informed ways of addressing them in a programme that included sessions on vaccine mandates, vaccine acceptance and demand, training on vaccine acceptance, and frameworks for resilience of vaccination programmes.}

Suppliers, as the first layer of the supply chain network, pose a great impact on environmental pollution. Therefore, in this paper a hybrid approach of fuzzy analysis network process (FANP), fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (FDEMATEL), and multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming (MOMILP) models are developed for circular supplier selection and order allocation in a multi-product circular closed-loop supply chain (C-CLSC) considering multi-depot, capacitated green routing problem using heterogeneous vehicles. In this regard, a mathematical model concerning an inventory-location-routing problem is developed that minimises cost and shortage simultaneously and also deals with imposed uncertainties. A fuzzy solution approach is proposed to simultaneously incorporate uncertainty and to change the multi-objective model into a single-objective model. To motivate the practical aspect of the proposed model in real world applications, we applied the model to an automotive timing belt manufacturer. The obtained results indicate that the proposed model is cost efficient and environmentally friendly for CLSC network designs.}

A systematic literature review was conducted on the Science Direct, Scopus and Web of Science databases. Key aspects for implementing and managing business models were identified according to the business model Canvas framework. Key aspects are related to the role of innovation and new markets, taking the customer perspective into account in the value creation process and being close to customers, adequate management of logistics and feedstock collection systems, being aware of different routes for valuing biomass, seeking technological development, building resilient value chains, and focusing on value creation to cover costs.

The hybrid supply chain is formed as a chain by multi-echelon manufacturers and service providers who work together to offer product service system to customers. In multi-echelon hybrid supply chain, each echelon customers’ response to variable service levels and interaction between inventory and service capacity strategy have a great impact on supply chain instability, which represents an important concern in supply chain research. To tackle this problem, we establish a system dynamics model, by taking the multi-echelon hybrid supply chain for a logistics equipment company in China as an example. Firstly, we analyzed the oscillation characteristics of service flow and product flow. Then, we proposed the performance metrics of bullwhip effect in multi-echelon hybrid supply chain. Finally, based on the model, we found that the bullwhip effect of multi-echelon hybrid supply chain could be smoothened by incorporating forecast smooth factor, control percentage coefficient and order lead time.}

The chemical looping hydrogen generation unit is connected in series to the downstream of a chemical looping gasification unit as an additional system for 100 MW·h coal gasification, with the function of supplementary combustion to produce hydrogen. Using Aspen Plus software for process simulation, the production of H2 and N2 in the series system is higher than that in the independent Chemical looping gasification and Chemical looping hydrogen generation systems, and the production of hydrogen is approximately 25.63% and 12.90% higher, respectively; The study found that when the gasification temperature is 900 °C, steam-carbon ratio is 0.84 and oxygen-carbon ratio is 1.5, the hydrogen production rate of the system was the maximum. At the same time, through heat exchange between logistics, high-pressure steam at 8.010 × 104 kg·h−1 and medium-pressure steam at 1.101 × 104 kg·h−1 are generated, and utility consumption is reduced by 61.58%, with utility costs decreasing by 48.69%.

Session timing appears to have an effect on CPT outcomes in civilian samples, but the role of timing in CPT has not yet been investigated in a military sample. Thus, this study examines the relationships between session frequency and consistency and changes in symptoms and dropout in a trial of CPT in the military. Participants included 135 active duty service members who sought treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; Mage=32.6 years; 89.6% male; 41.5% White, 26.7% Black, 23.0% Hispanic). Service members participated in 12 sessions of individual CPT intended to be scheduled twice per week, and completed follow-up assessments at 2 weeks and 6 months post-treatment. Results indicated that participants attended sessions about every 6.5 days and that session frequency and consistency were not related to rate of change in PTSD or depression outcomes. Session frequency was related to dropout, such that longer time between sessions was related to increased dropout. These results suggest that the positive outcomes seen after CPT are stable despite the unique challenges in logistics seen with military service members.}

This study aim to analyse the prevalence, clinical pattern and management of orofacial Infection in Hospital Sultan Abdul Halim (HSAH), Kedah, Malaysia. We also investigate any associations between demographic factors, diabetic status, smoking status, and number of space involvement towards the length of hospital stay.
Material and methods
All adult patients with orofacial infections who attended the Oral and Maxillofacial Department in HSAH from January 2015 to January 2019 were included. Descriptive statistical analysis was done for all variables. For cases requiring hospitalization, logistics regression analysis was performed using dichotomous dependent variable on length of stay(LOS), namely short stay group (LOS ≤ 5 days) and long stay group (LOS > 5 days). Simple logistic regression was performed to determine which factors are associated with prolonged hospital stay.
Results
A total of 207 patients (133 male, 74 female) were included in this study with mean age of 33.85 ± 19.36 years. The most common aetiology of orofacial infection was odontogenic (71.0 %). Most of the orofacial spaces involved were single (89.9 %), with the mean number of 1.04 ± 1.391. For inpatient cases, three factors were significantly associated with increased risk of prolonged hospital stay, namely multiple spaced involved (OR 3.492, 95 % 1.132–10.77), presence of diabetes (OR 3.694, 95 % 1.314–10.389), and active smoker (OR 5.029, 95 % 1.894–13.349).
Conclusion
Our study showed a relatively high prevalence of orofacial infection in this region. Factors such as smoking, diabetes and involvement of multiple spaces are associated with prolonged hospital stay during the treatment of orofacial infection.}

In a next step, this set is evaluated with the intension in mind to identify scenarios in the 2020's. Three prominent candidate scenarios, distinct by the basic staging approach, have been identified and analysed in detail with respect to configuration design, system trades, operational aspects and the benefit each scenario is generating. With these key points in mind, the three scenarios are compared in order to identify the most suitable approach. Furthermore, a step-wise approach towards an increasingly sustainable human lunar surface campaigns is analysed and discussed. This approach introduces an increasing number of reusable elements by increasing the technological progression. It is found that a three-stage lander architecture promises a high mass efficiency and thus this approach is investigated in more detail of system engineering and requirements.}

There are three scenarios has been constructed, in which Scenarios I and II apply a multi-port-calling networks based on the implementation of the Sea Toll Programme in Indonesia, while scenario III uses a hub-and-spoke network by involving the port of Tenau Kupang-East Timor Province as a transhipment port of container distribution from the port of Tanjung Perak to the South-East of Indonesia. As the result, scenario III generates the lowest total shipping costs. In other words, involving the port of Tenau Kupang as a transhipment port can help to reduce total shipping costs. Finally, the selected scenario become a recommendation for shipping practices to find the best solutions to improve the eastern connectivity in Indonesia. Moreover, the result also will encourage the government and port authority to take a consideration in re-configure Tenau-Kupang port infrastructure to become transhipment port thus can attract the cargo volume.}

Physicians are frequently asked to practice in hospitals different from their home institution, often under contracts called professional service agreements (PSAs). With highly variable onboarding processes, traveling physicians are often left to “figure out” the available resources, processes of care, crucial relationships, and culture of the new institution. This research aimed to understand the current practices of onboarding for the purpose of informing future improvements in practice.
Methods
Two physicians conducted semistructured, in-depth interviews with physicians working at hospitals beyond their home institution. A thematic qualitative analysis was performed.
Results
The sample included 20 physicians from six specialties. Key findings include (1) the basic logistics of providing care in a new environment are often not incorporated into physician onboarding and can limit physicians’ ability to provide care efficiently and effectively; (2) the strength of interpersonal relationships greatly influences the ability of physicians to get help when working in new environments; and (3) managing clinical emergencies in unfamiliar settings can result in significant perceived risk to patient safety due to delays in providing care.
Conclusion
The onboarding process, for physicians working in new institutions, provides significant opportunity for improvement. In the future, more work is needed to ensure that the most notable differences between institutions are clarified, physicians have the necessary information and professional relationships to handle emergencies, and they know which patients they can safely care for in their new institution.}

In many cases, the unavailability of medicinal products has a substantial impact on the capability of National Healthcare Systems in ensuring the continuity of care. Shortages originate from multifactorial causes. In particular, they can be due to supply-related factors (e.g., manufacturing issues, regulatory issues, logistics, distribution) and demand-related ones (e.g., fluctuating drug demand, parallel market, tendering, price and reimbursement policies). However, some extraordinary geopolitical events (e.g., Brexit) may also affect medicines’ availability. The capability of European Regulatory Authorities and other stakeholders, which are involved in the pharmaceutical distribution chain and the healthcare assistance services, to define suitable problem-solving strategies has been limited for years by the fragmentation of the European regulatory framework, starting from the lack of a univocal definition of a medicine shortage. Only in 2019, the EMA and HMA joint task force released the first harmonized “shortage” definition in the European Economic Area (EEA) and guidance on public communication. This manuscript aims to review the current European regulatory framework on medicine shortages. To support the activities of regulators, manufacturers and other healthcare professionals, an algorithm was also proposed to be used as a harmonized procedure to determine the shortage/unavailability impact on public health and to rationalize the problem-solving strategies adopted in all different settings.}

The results show that indirect carbon emissions caused by sectoral economic activities decline stage by stage in the industrial chains, and the decline rate and time lag intensity vary significantly among sectors. The logistics industry has the highest spread efficiency for indirect carbon emissions in the industrial chains, and the construction industry is the first industry affected by the indirect carbon emissions caused by the manufacturing industry. The power/thermal industry’s impact on China’s carbon emissions is the fastest, but its duration is the shortest, while the impact of the manufacturing and mining industries are more stable and durable. However, considering the fluctuations in final demand, the manufacturing industry has replaced the power/thermal industry as the most important industry affecting the time lag effect of China’s carbon emissions. This study provides important theoretical and practical value for indirect carbon emissions forecasting.}

abstract = {Determining how wells in fractured crystalline bedrock are interconnected is essential in defining contaminant flow paths and in interpreting water quality data from wells. Although various tracers and geophysical techniques have been used with success, the high cost or logistics may restrict their implementation. This study demonstrates a low-cost technique for identifying fracture connections between wells by combining the dissolved oxygen alteration method (DOAM) with cross borehole hydraulic pumping tests. Following the alteration of the dissolved oxygen (DO) profile in the observation well through bubbler aeration, an interconnected well is pumped, which results in changes in borehole flow in the aerated observation well. The DO profile in the observation well is monitored over time to characterize the changes in borehole flow and identify fractures that hydraulically connect to the pumping well. The method was demonstrated at three test sites in Storrs, Connecticut. Each site has two or three interconnecting wells in fractured crystalline bedrock and varying flow conditions. The DOAM successfully identified interconnecting fractures in wells 15–84 m apart.}

Due to its expensive transportation, manure sources are often the sole criteria during biogas plant site selection, regarding feedstock supply. Encouraging biogas plant operators to use larger amounts of crop residues in the feedstock is favourable from an energy management viewpoint, but its spatial projection on resource logistics and its significance on biogas plant selection is less investigated. In this study, scenarios were created with different feedstock compositions considering constant manure and varying crop residue ratios. Based on their potential biogas yields and the location of livestock farms, a manure source-oriented site selection and facility scaling was made in a Hungarian study area. The applied GIS-based feedstock allocation and logistic analysis defined the crop acquisition possibilities and optimal transportation routes, assuming multiple resource-competitive biogas plants. The results indicate that feedstock composition can indirectly impact the site selection procedure and supply security if high crop residue demand is considered. Resource acquisition possibilities and economic feasibility are significantly affected by the location and density of the proposed biogas plants and their relative position to the crop supply areas. Due to the geographical heterogeneity of the supply side and the demand points, the transportation costs of crop residues and the digestate exceed those of the manure in all scenarios, which draws attention to the importance of spatial availability of crop residues during biogas plant site selection and scaling.}

abstract = {The conversion of oil palm waste to valuable fuels via biological and thermochemical means has witnessed much interest from researchers. Increasing tonnes of palm waste resulting from about 400 palm oil mills across Malaysia necessitates a rethink towards its conversion to energy to curb soil and air pollution, underground water contamination, and pest habitats. Converting these palm wastes to fuel at a commercial scale is necessary to advance Malaysia's bioenergy. This will ensure cleaner production and sustainability by providing low carbon energy that could be used in industrial, transport, and residential sectors. However, what is the technology readiness levels of these conversion methods in Malaysia? Have they reached commercialisation? What hinders them from attaining it? This study conducted an intensive literature review on five conversion technologies broadly classified as thermochemical (combustion, gasification and pyrolysis) and biological (anaerobic digestion and fermentation) to identify the extent to which each process has been adopted. For each of the technologies, the following were established: (1) Studies conducted by researchers using different palm wastes; (2) Challenges faced; (3) Technology readiness level. The significant findings revealed that fermentation is still at a lab scale, gasification and anaerobic digestion have reached pilot-scale while combustion and pyrolysis have attained commercialisation. Significant commercialisation challenges include technical and economic issues, communal consciousness, and stakeholder gap. Current research gaps, recommendations, future outlooks, and the way forward were discussed, along with developing a framework that features the key barriers, enablers, and stakeholders responsible for commercialisation.}

Normally, these waste materials are allowed to decay in the natural process or burnt to recover a part of the energy in the thermal form, leading to environmental pollution and loss of value. There is an imperative need to realize that food waste is a bundle of energy, which requires carefully planned recovery without damaging the environment. Conversion of food waste to bio-based liquid or gaseous fuels appears to be an attractive option to meet the escalating demand for fuel and at the same time slowing down the fast-depleting fossil fuel resources. In this context, it is felt appropriate to review the current status of the available technologies which are used in the disposal of food waste in order to identify the variables for process intensification to convert them to fuel keeping in mind the environmental concerns and logistics of utilization. The technologies including incineration, landfill, composting, anaerobic digestion, pyrolysis and biochemical methods have been assessed alongside the recent developing technologies such as hydrothermal carbonization and supercritical water gasification. The critical evaluations of these technologies have been made based on the concepts of life cycle analysis, multi-objective optimization and circular bio-economics which help in assessing the environmental impact. Finally, safety aspects and the way forward are highlighted for future work. This article could form a promising path towards a holistic assessment of efficient food waste to energy conversion for a sustainable development.}

At the beginning of this year, the UK government released a White Paper on Reforms of the 1983 Mental Health Act (MHA) aiming to achieve higher quality, accessible mental health care, as well as empowering people detained under MHA during the process and continuation of detention. In this piece, we focus on the potential impact of the proposal around appropriate care, management and detention of people with Personality Disorder (PD) within the criminal justice system (CJS), psychiatric service provision and community routes. We briefly review the historical context of reforms of PD services in the UK and discuss the proposed changes and issues in relation to the criteria of least restriction, detention and therapeutic benefit. We highlight the complexity around referral routes and logistics barriers for secure PD services that might hamper speeded referral routes and raise concerns around responsibility for authorisation of transfers in the context of risk of serious harm to the public. We emphasise the complex treatment needs of individuals with PDs and how these are potentially not met. We also discuss the shift of focus from reactive care to preventative measures and early intervention in the community for individuals with mild-to-moderate levels of PD. We highlight the need for appropriate integrative services in the community to facilitate assessment across services, identification of complex needs and support options including earlier routine screening and potential digital interventions to optimise specialised care for PD.}

These shuttles run along steel rails, which are usually produced from thin metal sheets that are cold roll-formed into the desired section. These shuttles also work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, so the rails are very sensitive to fatigue phenomena, caused by the cyclic loading of the moving shuttles, moreover, cracks due to material fatigue have already been observed in these types of rails. In addition, the competitiveness of the European industrial sector is pushing the design of these profiles to lower thickness requirements, which further increases concerns about their fatigue performance. Within this background, the FASTCOLD European project has been carried out, whose research plan consists in developing fatigue design rules for the mentioned applications, which are not covered by existing Eurocode 3 rules, which only addresses thick hot-rolled sections. Experimental fatigue testing has been carried out backed by numerical simulations of these tests. A new fatigue setup has been developed to generate representative fatigue cracking to the shuttle cyclic loads. Numerical simulations of the cold roll-forming fabrication process are also being carried out to determine the importance of the residual stresses in the fatigue life of the rail. With the experimental data obtained from fatigue testing backed by numerical simulations, important contributions are made to the design codes (e.g. Eurocode 3) in dealing with the fatigue design of such critical details.}

The call for a circular economy and sustainable strategies is now louder than ever. Remanufacturing can alleviate our environmental impact while still providing opportunities for profitable business. However, there is a need for a framework detailing the necessary steps for a successful remanufacturing start-up. This paper aims to identify the essential and supportive factors an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) must consider when transitioning part of its business to remanufacturing. Such factors could aid both current actors in the industrial setting as well as make way for further investigations and more advanced frameworks from the scientific field. The task is carried out through a novel combination of prior research on production development and remanufacturing, with support from a case study performed at an electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) manufacturer. This paper concludes that the first essential factors to be addressed when switching orientation towards remanufacturing can be contained in four categories: core acquisition and reverse logistics, labor skill and availability, remanufacturing facilities, and remanufacturing process and technology. Secondary supporting factors include design for remanufacturing and information feedback, remanufacturing process improvements, remanufacturing market knowledge, and organization, planning and control.}

The emergency department (ED) relies on high-functioning teams to deliver consistent and safe patient care. Experts recommend that both emergency physicians and ED nurses participate in team training. However, there are currently no nationally accepted curricula for either profession to embed this training in their professional development, particularly for health workers who are novice or transitioning into critical care roles.
Methods
An interprofessional educator team designed and embedded a series of simulation scenarios within a novel orientation program for novice nurses transitioning to critical care roles in the ED to teach clinical and teamwork skills for conjoint groups of resident physician and novice nurse learners. The team created four interprofessional simulations to represent the acuity and breadth of patient populations in the ED critical care bays.
Intervention/Refinement
To date, the team has conducted 24 two-week orientation sessions for 48 nurses and 51 resident physicians. Overall mean scores for the Debriefing Assessment for Simulation in Healthcare (DASH) instrument from nursing participants in the first 18 sessions were high. Qualitative evaluation data from both nurses and physicians demonstrated a positive impact of the simulations and provided insight into respective roles, identities, and priorities across professions. Participant feedback led to iterative steps in refinement of the simulations, including adjustments in debriefings and logistics of the orientation program.
Implications for Practice
A team-based interprofessional simulation program was found to be feasible and acceptable for practicing novice physicians and nurses as part of a nursing critical care orientation program in the ED. Future work will assess the program's long-term impact on teamwork and safety in the actual clinical environment.}

Descriptive data such as gene expression profiles and cell morphology changes in the context of ASDs provided by postmortem brain studies, however, constitute very interesting phenotypes that can guide more mechanistic investigations currently being performed on human cellular models such as induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)-derived cells leading to therapeutic strategy. The current review analyses how studies performed on human iPSCs complements and is related to human genetics and postmortem brain tissue studies in the field of ASD research. The review also examines the logistics required to generate therapeutic strategies from research focused on patient-derived iPSCs. Thus, combined, data emerging from human genetics, postmortem brain studies and human iPSC models should improve our current state of knowledge on the ASD and generate information leading to personalized treatment of ASDs.}

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is an unprecedented challenge. Different models of reorganization have been described aiming to preserve resources and ensure optimal medical care. Limited clinical neurosurgical experience with patients with COVID-19 has been reported. We share organizational experience, attitudes, and preliminary data of patients treated at our institution.
Methods
Institutional guidelines and patient workflow are described and visualized. A cohort of all neurosurgical patients managed during the lockdown period is presented and analyzed, assessing suspected nosocomial infection risk factors. A comparative surgical subcohort from the previous year was used to investigate the impact on surgical activity.
Results
A total of 176 patients were admitted in 66 days, 20 of whom tested positive for COVID-19. Patients initially admitted to the neurosurgical ward were less likely to be suspected for a COVID-19 infection compared with patients admitted for critical emergencies, particularly with neurovascular and stroke-related diseases. The mortality of patients with COVID-19 was remarkably high (45%), and even higher in patients who underwent surgical intervention (77%). In addition to the expected decrease in surgical activity (–53%), a decrease in traumatic emergencies was noted.
Conclusions
By applying infection prevention and resource-sparing logistics measures shared by the international medical community, we were able to maintain essential neurosurgical care in a pandemic with controlled nosocomial infection risk. Special consideration should be given to medical management and surgical indications in patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, because they seem to show a problematic hemostatic profile that might result in an unfavorable clinical and surgical outcome.}

With the increase in the number and type of parks, industrial park recycling transformation (IPRT) has been pivotal in developing the circular economy concept at the regional level in China. Compared with EIPs, this study identifies the characteristics of IPRT as green, cyclic, efficient, shared, and sustainable. To effectively explore how to promote IPRT development, the concept of critical material flow with material flow analysis is introduced to trace materials that are critical to high consumption areas with significant environmental impacts. The paper also suggests that cleaner production audits of enterprises can provide a basis for critical material flow analysis. Analysis of critical material flow pathways can facilitate the establishment of reverse logistics, which is important for achieving closed-loop IPRT through imitation of natural ecosystem cycles. In addition, an information system and database management platform are required to support critical material flow analysis in IPRT. Using a case study of the Tianjin Economic-Technological Development Area, the findings reveal that IPRT can be promoted from enterprises at the micro-level to parks at the macro-level based on critical material flow analysis. These results provide a methodological and practical reference for improving the stability of the industrial symbiosis of EIPs and contribute to IPRT research. Moreover, an analytic framework is provided that demonstrates how to promote IPRT in practice.}

abstract = {Background
Global oppressive power structures in healthcare systems and between professions hinder care delivery. The family nurse practitioner is a new role in Israel. Through an innovative international collaborative education partnership, 19 Israeli nurses were trained as family nurse practitioners. Israeli physician preceptors integrated them into a national health maintenance organization despite national and organizational resistance.
Objectives
Explore Israeli physicians' experiences while providing clinical mentorship to family nurse practitioners and develop strategies for the implementation of the new community role.
Design
Qualitative focused critical ethnographic approach.
Participants
Eleven Israeli physician preceptors were recruited from a larger pool of 50.
Methods
Physicians were interviewed via recorded phone calls and asked open-ended questions about precepting family nurse practitioners. Observations of the program were included from the year prior to the interviews. Data were analyzed using Carspecken's five steps for critical ethnographic approach.
Results
Three categories for transforming the current status were identified: role clarification, logistics, and collaborative education. Exemplar cases described collaborative practice regarding measurable outcomes. Learning happened through “shadowing” and “coaching” techniques. Findings led to the Collaborative Team Development Illustration which mirrors current recommendations from the World Health Organization and Institute of Medicine.
Conclusions
The Collaborative Team Development Illustration offers a structured strategy for advocacy and transformation in other oppressive health systems considering introducing nurse practitioners. This paper provides evidence that physician participants believed partnerships with nurse practitioners could improve patient care delivery. We hope this research will contribute to changing power relations in healthcare and improve outcomes. This may offer hope for integration of family nurse practitioners in countries that currently do not support advanced practice nursing roles.}

Previous research has found that accumulative waste generation in construction projects follows an S-curve, but improving our understanding of waste generation requires its investigation at a higher level of granularity. Such efforts, however, are often constrained by lack of quality “bigger” data, i.e. data that is bigger than normal small data. This research aims to provide an anatomy of waste generation flow in building projects by making use of a large set of data on waste generation in 19 demolition, 59 foundation, and 54 new building projects undertaken in Hong Kong between 2011 and 2019. We know that waste is generated in far from a steady stream as it is always impacted by contingent factors. However, we do find that peaks of waste generation in foundation projects appear when project duration is at 50–85%, and in new building projects at 40–70% of total project time. Our research provides useful information for waste managers in developing their waste management plans, arranging waste hauling logistics, and benchmarking waste management performance.}

It is known to be NP-hard in the strong sense, and there is no polynomial-time algorithm that can guarantee a constant-factor approximation (unless P=NP). We provide an exact algorithm that is fixed-parameter tractable in the slack and the maximum number of time windows overlapping at any point in time, i.e., the width. This algorithm has a runtime exponential in these parameters, but quadratic in the number of jobs, even when modeling sequence-dependent setup times. We further provide a fixed-parameter fully-polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS) with only this width as a parameter, having a runtime bound that is cubic. Finally, we propose a neighbourhood heuristic similar to the Balas-Simonetti neighbourhood. All algorithms use an efficient representation of the state space inspired by decision diagrams, where partial solutions that are provably dominated are excluded from further consideration. Experimental evidence shows that the exact method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art on instances where the width is smaller than one third of the number of jobs and finds optimal solutions to previously unsolved instances. The FPTAS is competitive to state-of-the-art heuristics only when the width is significantly smaller, but the neighbourhood heuristic outperforms most other heuristics in runtime or quality.}

Research is an important component of an effective response to the increasing frequency of widespread infectious disease outbreaks. In turn, the ability to do such studies relies on willingness of partners in different regions to collaborate and the capacity to mount a rapid research response. The EU-funded ZIKAlliance Consortium has initiated a multicountry epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory research agenda to determine the incidence, risk factors, and outcomes of Zika virus infection in pregnant women and their children. We reviewed the timeline of patient cohort initiation in relation to the Zika virus epidemic and mapped key events regarding funding, regulatory approvals, and site preparation during this timeline. We then assessed barriers and delays that the international research team experienced through a systematic telephone interview. We have identified three major bottlenecks in the implementation of a swift response: the absence of a timeline for the funding process, delays in regulatory and ethical approval, and the challenging logistics of laboratory support, including diagnostics. These bottlenecks illustrate the clear and urgent need for implementing a strong and permanent global emerging infectious diseases research capacity that has structured funding, enables long-term partnerships, and develops basic clinical and laboratorial research and a response infrastructure that is ready to deploy.}

Whether the built environment can affect genetic predisposition of Alzheimer's disease (AD) should be explored.

We used a genetic sub-study of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey including 1199 older adults (mean age: 100.3 ± 3.4 years) aged 90 years old or older. We used Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) to quantify the genetic AD risk and two types of measurements based on Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to access the residential greenness (contemporaneous and annual average NDVI). Contemporaneous NDVI values were the NDVI value collected at the corresponding survey, and the annual average NDVI was the average value of NDVI during the year before the corresponding survey. We defined cognitive impairment as having a Mini-Mental State Examination score below 25. In the multivariable logistics regression models, contemporaneous NDVI and genetic AD risk were associated with cognitive impairment. Among those with low genetic AD risk, the risk of cognitive impairment was lower in those living around higher greenness (contemporaneous NDVI OR: 0.55, 95% CI: [0.34, 0.86]; Pinteraction: 0.071; annual average NDVI OR: 0.49, 95% CI: [0.31, 0.79]; Pinteraction: 0.040). We did not observe significant associations between greenness and cognitive impairment among those with high genetic AD risk. Prevention efforts using PRS warrant a higher granularity of environmental exposures and biological etiology data.}

This paper presents the results of a systematic review of 4491 publications spanning from 1998 through 2019. The review presents the viability of 3D-printed construction as a replacement for conventional construction methods, specifically in remote, isolated, or expeditionary environments, where conventional construction capability may be limited. The paper includes an analysis and characterization of the existing body of 3D-printed construction literature before evaluating seven viability factors of the method: materials, structural design, process efficiency, logistics, labor, environmental impact, and cost. In addition, the paper highlights three case studies of 3D-printed construction in remote, isolated, and expeditionary environments. The paper concludes by suggesting areas of future research to ensure the viability of this technology, such as printing full-scale structures and components with locally sourced materials in uncontrolled environments, defining standards for 3D printing, automating additional construction processes, and performing both environmental impact and cost life-cycle analyses. With continued investment in research and development, 3D printing could become a more viable and accepted method of construction, transforming the way the industry is managed in remote, isolated, and expeditionary environments.}

To achieve their HSE goals, organizations are required to have the processes associated with HSE components designed and developed in a single system. However, the organizations dependence on software becomes evident when macro-level managerial decisions are made based on all the data entered and stored in the organizations’ systems such as procurement, logistics, manufacturing, maintenance, and other related systems all of which might be isolated and separated from each other. These systems may provide a variety of features for organizations, but the lack of integration between them makes it difficult to interact and collaborate with the other processes of the organization. Therefore, the critical point is the integration of these systems in a comprehensive enterprise software. This integration challenge is due to the interdependency and the complexity of the data transmission as well as the relationships among various parts of the organization. To shed some light on the integration complexities this paper is intended to propose an approach to tackle these issues by designing an integrated HSE system with all its processes, features, and connections through an industrial enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. To illustrate the applicability of the system in an industrial context, we conduct a case study of the implementation of this HSE system in the mining industry and closely scrutinize the integration-related challenges faced during this process of software analysis, development and deployment.}

However, SC has overcome these difficulties to achieve business targets and become the leading domestic retailer in Vietnam. Although SC must deal with issues relating to salary policies, technology, warehousing, logistics, competitive pressures, and food safety, its success can be seen as evidence demonstrating that consumer cooperatives in Vietnam are able to overcome challenges in the domestic market to achieve business targets in the retail industry. Clearly the achievement of SC in recent years is the result of different strategies in system development, human resources, marketing, procurement, and operation. In the context of international economic integration, support from the state and consumers are crucial factors contributing to the development of a domestic retailer like SC.}

The pre-existing partner network created in India for the delivery of polio vaccines was initially used to eradicate polio and later on embedded in the health systems network to promote routine immunization and other health interventions efficiently. The experience from this network offered lessons for strengthening the health care systems and provided a well-established network that could be utilized for other vaccine initiatives. It has also been established that successful partnerships between a broad range of stakeholders provide support, strengthen the health system, and accelerate vaccine innovation, introduction, access, logistics, and communication support. However, beyond polio eradication, there have not been too many documented success stories of vaccine introduction, which could be replicated in other new vaccine introductions and allied health initiatives. The authors have reviewed the successful and time-bound introduction of rotavirus vaccine (RVV) in India in the present article.
Methods
The review was conducted based on a partnership framework which analysed multiple factors-partnership prerequisites, partnership model, partnership process, and partnership performance, thereby providing a comprehensive insight into the successful utilization of partnership networks for rotavirus vaccine introduction under the Universal Immunization Program in India.
Results & conclusion
The review also highlights the role of a lead agency in creating a fertile ground for lush, efficient, and effective partnerships amongst different stakeholders. The already existing RVV partnership framework reviewed by the authors can be successfully utilized for future new vaccine introductions.}

Hence, an integrated Water Supply and Wastewater Collection System (WSWCS) under uncertainty is proposed. Furthermore, regarding the trend of sustainable development, the environmental dimensions and social benefits of the integrated WSWCS are contributed. To meet the standards of the sustainable development in developing countries, a case study in Iran is applied to a novel multi-objective stochastic optimization model based on triple bottom lines of sustainability. Having already been employed to similar optimization problems, the Social Engineering Optimizer (SEO) has been never applied in this research area. Another innovation of this study is to introduce an improved multi-objective SEO to solve this complicated model.

The proposed methodology in this study includes harvest intensity which is often overlooked. The Pontiac region located in the Province of Quebec (Southeastern Canada) is used as a case study due to the availability of data in this forestry biomass rich region. Furthermore, there are significant similarities with other forestry regions to enable generalisation of the proposed case study. Harvest intensities of 423 harvest zones (cutblocks) are considered in cost and GHG emissions analysis of delivered biomass from each cutblock to the biorefinery. The results show that harvest intensities of cutblocks must be prioritized over conventional parameters such as transportation distance. The selection and prioritisation of cutblocks according to transportation distance without considering harvest intensities would result in an increase of about 12.5% in delivered costs of biomass for small and medium scale biorefineries. Results also reveal that the transportation distance would be a more significant parameter when using the same harvest intensity for all the selected cutblocks. Required logistics and harvesting equipment for three biorefinery sizes were also quantified. Sensitivity analysis shows that reduced productivity of harvest equipment by 20% could increase the delivered costs of biomass and GHG emissions by 10% for medium and large scale biorefineries and by 13% for a small scale biorefinery.}

The current solutions ensuring temperature maintenance are either labor-intensive or prone to triggering alarms that require no corrective measures, which, in turn, increase the alarm investigation costs. Machine learning (ML) methods have fared well both in the areas characterized by the execution of repetitive tasks and in the identification of false alarms; however, they have not been applied in the context of temperature monitoring in a pharmaceutical SC. In this paper, we used the real-world data of a large international logistics service provider for the period of 2013–2018 and compared the optimized performance of 10 ML classification methods in the task of false temperature alarm identification. Such additional features as temperature in the location of possible physical handling and average temperature deviation were either externally collected or estimated to enrich the models. In general, gradient boosting achieved the best performance in our evaluations, with an accuracy of 95.9% in comparison with the value of 16.6% demonstrated by the current legacy rule-based system. The feature ranking and sensitivity tests pointed to the strength of the features indicating an absolute temperature deviation and the location of cargo along the SC. The tests simulating model applications on new dissimilar observations showed various performance losses across classifiers, with the best stability retained for a new customer scenario and largest performance decreases for a new temperature range scenario.}

Immunotherapy has made encouraging progress in the treatment of urothelial carcinoma, but only a small percentage of patients respond effectively to the immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Our study aims to develop a classifier could effectively predict the response to ICB.
Methods
Support vector machines recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) algorithm was used to feature selection, then compared nine common binary classification algorithms through machine learning, we selected the classifier with the highest prediction performance (LASSO logistics classifier). Ten-fold cross-validation was used to avoid the overfitting effect.
Results
We developed a classifier on a urothelial carcinoma cohort treated with PD-L1 inhibitor Atzolizumab (IMvigor210 cohort, n = 272) and calculated a tumor mutational burden-related LASSO score (TLS) using the LASSO algorithm, which was significantly correlated with Tumor mutational burden (TMB) and neoantigen burden. We validated the efficacy of TLS in predicting prognosis and immunotherapy benefit in internal (IMvigor210) and external validation set (TCGA-BLCA, n = 406), respectively.
Conclusions
After in-depth analysis, we provide a new idea for stratified treatment of such patients, that is, patients with high TLS should use ICB and also may benefit from hormone therapy, while patients with low TLS respond poorly to ICB and maybe benefit from targeting TGFβ.}

abstract = {Operation and maintenance are important administrative and operational functions of the production, as they can guarantee the required demand. Together, they have the responsibilities of doing right (quality advantage), fast (speed advantage), timely (reliability advantage), quick setup (flexibility advantage) and affordability. In addition, they are close to several important activities such as: safety, environment, productivity, marketing, quality, reliability and accounting systems. With this new vision, changes and opportunities are being presented to these sectors of operation and maintenance. In the new paradigm, the maintenance and operation teams are motivated to strategically guarantee the full operation of the production system and not only to preserve the equipment. And, thus, to develop an efficient strategy, providing the sustainability and the increase of the assets of the company, reaching the goals of the planning and control of the production established by the company. The main objective of this work is to analyze a proposal to meet the required production demand through the alignment of production control planning strategies and maintenance planning and control. The analysis of the research points to some significant contributions, for example, to the areas of strategy and logistics of organizations that work mainly in environments with a high level of competitiveness. Through a case study, the analysis pointed to the positive impact of alignment on parameters such as: sustainability of the competitive strategy, productivity, costs, reliability and availability of physical assets, and flexibilization of the productive organizational system.}

abstract = {Background
Few opportunities exist for surgeons to receive technical skills feedback after training. Surgeons at hospitals within the Illinois Surgical Quality Improvement Collaborative were invited to participate in a peer-to-peer video-based coaching initiative focused on improving technical skills in laparoscopic right colectomy. We present a formative qualitative evaluation of a video-based coaching initiative.
Methods
Concurrent with the implementation of our video-based coaching initiative, we conducted two focus groups and 15 individual semistructured interviews with participants; all interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed. A subset of surgeons participated in a group video-review session, which was observed by qualitative researchers. Transcripts and notes were analyzed using an organizational behavior framework adapted from executive coaching.
Results
Participation in the initiative was primarily motivated by the opportunity to learn from others and improve skills. Surgeons highlighted the value of self-video and peer-video assessment not only to learn new techniques but also for self-reflection and benchmarking. Barriers to participation included logistics (e.g. using the laparoscopic recording devices, coordinating schedules for peer coaching), time commitment, and a surgical culture that assumes the intent of coaching is to address deficiencies.
Conclusions
Video-based peer-coaching provides a platform for surgeons to reflect, benchmark against peers, and receive personalized feedback; however, more work is needed to increase participation and sustain involvement over time. There is an opportunity to decrease logistical barriers and increase acceptability of coaching by integrating video-based coaching into existing surgical conferences and established continuous professional development efforts.}

Under the carbon emission policy, managers must aim to reduce carbon emissions in manufacturing and distribution. This research considers an integrated single-machine scheduling and multi-vehicle routing problem, which allows the switching of machine in a period between two adjacent workpieces. Initially, a mathematical programming model is established to minimize the total carbon emissions, and then a tabu search hybrid algorithm is proposed to solve the minimization problem. Moreover, an enterprise case and twenty simulated examples are studied. Computational results verify the advantage of integrated scheduling model and show that a sustainable scheduling method can reduce the total carbon emissions by coordinating production and distribution effectively. Finally, the model is extended to the cases of minimizing total costs and minimizing both total costs and carbon emissions. The model and algorithm can guide the green manufacturing and logistics for industrial enterprises.}

However, considering that it entails significant amounts of packaging and food waste and has seen enormous growth in the UK since the 1990s, it is not sufficiently understood how OTG emerged as a sector. Conceptualising OTG as a provisioning practice and adopting a ‘Learning History’ approach, we aggregate journalistic columns and expert interviews into lineages that explain sectoral developments over time, and we ask how stakeholders frame OTG’s emergence and linked waste issues. We first show how OTG derives from an interplay of actors and shifts in socio-spatial organisation within the four areas of domestic economy and convenience, health and environment, urban space and policy, and corporate economy and technology. Subsequently, we outline typical understandings of packaging and food waste and shortcomings therein. Extending debates on consumer responsibilisation, we identify narratives that sideline producers’ focus on growth and their role in shaping OTG provision. Stakeholders often frame (1) OTG as demand-driven by reference to an ostensible ‘convenience culture’, (2) material waste as an issue of the ‘consumer-facing’ end of the supply chain, i.e. concerning food wrappers rather than materials used ‘back-of-store’ for logistics, processing, and hygiene and (3) food waste as a matter of avoiding leftovers while taking for granted resource-intensive, “wasteful” foods as part of businesses’ portfolios. We conclude that addressing waste higher up the supply chain may allow for a more nuanced account of causes of, and solutions to, unsustainable provisioning practices.}

abstract = {Background
Shift work may cause insomnia and sleepiness in individuals. The present study aimed to exam shift work disorder (SWD), and to investigate their associations with individual characteristics.
Methods
A total of 1833 shift workers were assessed using the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index, Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Composite Scale of Morningness (CSM), Circadian Type Inventory (CTI), Center for Epidemiologic Studies–Depression Scale (CES-D), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and other self-compiled socio-demographic questionnaires.
Results
In the current sample, 17.1% shift workers have experienced insomnia symptoms, 20.9% were tested for daytime sleepiness, and 19.9% were categorized as having SWD. Logistics regressions revealed that history of mental disorders (OR = 2.04, 95% CI = 1.30–3.21), chronic physical illness (OR = 1.53, 95% CI = 1.17–1.99), CES-D scores (OR = 1.03, 95% CI = 1.02–1.05), BAI scores (OR = 1.04, 95% CI = 1.03–1.06), languid/vigorous tendencies (OR = 1.06, 95% CI = 1.03–1.10) were positively associated with the onset of SWD, while morningness (OR = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.94–0.99) decreased the odds of SWD onset.
Conclusions
These findings suggested that attention should be drawn to individuals with mental and chronic diseases in when scheduling work shifts. While SWD and its associates should be considered when providing psychological services to shift workers.}

However, the trajectory planning is a great challenge especially when a number of mobile robotics operates in the warehouse simultaneously. This paper proposes a cyber-physical system model for smart robotic warehouse to implement the workflow data collection and procedure monitor. A decoupled method is presented to find a conflict-free path for the mobile vehicles in the warehouses, after distributing destinations to mobile robots to minimize the total travel distance. The improved A* algorithm is applied to find paths from the source node to the destination node for single mobile vehicle in the domain of smart logistics. Collisions are detected by comparing the occupying time window of each mobile vehicle. Three collision avoidance strategies are developed to solve the conflicts and the candidate path with the minimal completion time is selected as the final determined route. The contribution of the paper is to propose a CPS-enabled robotic warehouse with dynamic conflict-free strategy to self-configure the path to optimize warehouse operation efficiency.}

The rapid pace of change in today's globalization has made it impossible for a centralized operation to succeed in all aspects of performance. To keep up with demands in this situation, this paper proposes an approach wherein supply networks, with independent ownerships of resources, compete against each other to maximize their market share. This competition is carried out in the growth phase of supply networks which are relationship-based managed under main firms’ brands. In this study, environmental sustainability is achieved through the development of a multi-agent (multi-network) distribution mechanism. Although several studies have been conducted in multi-factory manufacturing, this paper is the first attempt to develop such an environmentally sustainable shared platform in the distribution level of the network (including main firms (brands), manufacturers, governmental logistics service providers, and franchised retailers). Even more striking, the downstream members of the network (franchised stores) are to increase their monopoly interests alongside attempting to expand the overall share of the main brand. This implies a left-behind concept called virtual alliance. This problem is formulated using a mixed-integer programming model. Further, two gaming-based heuristic algorithms are prepared in the Nash and Stackelberg formulations. To evaluate the efficiency of the chosen scheme, a real-world example is considered and compared with a classical case. The obtained results illustrate a better performance of the proposed approach.}

In a port, container ships usually need the assistance of tugboats in order to undergo berthing, shifting, and unberthing movements. Effective scheduling of the tugboats for serving the ships is thus of great importance for ensuring safe and efficient container ship movements in a port. However, research on tugboat scheduling is scarce in the literature. We contribute to the literature by studying a real-life tugboat scheduling problem (Tug-SP). We formulate the Tug-SP using a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model taking into consideration various practical constraints. In view of the specific problem structure, we further develop six families of valid inequalities to strengthen the MILP model. To efficiently solve the Tug-SP, we develop a tailored branch-and-cut algorithm by incorporating these valid inequalities into a standard branch-and-bound solution framework. We evaluate the computational performance of the proposed branch-and-cut algorithm using a set of test instances generated from real-life ship traffic data collected from the Port of Singapore. The computational results validate the effectiveness of the proposed valid inequalities, and show that the branch-and-cut algorithm can optimally solve instances of realistic sizes with a reasonable amount of computation time.}

One of these is a relaxation of restrictions on the size and load capacity of trucks that circulate between member States and a proposal has been made for Longer and Heavier Vehicles (LHVs) to be allowed to circulate across borders. LHVs are the so-called “megatrucks” (i.e., trucks with a length of 25 meters and a weight of 60 tonnes). Megatrucks have allowed to circulate for decades in some European countries such as Norway, Finland, and Sweden, world leaders in traffic accident prevention, although the impact that cross-border traffic would have on road safety is still unknown. Methods: This article provides an econometric analysis of the potential impact on road safety of allowing the circulation of “megatrucks” throughout the EU. Results: The findings show that countries that currently allow megatrucks to circulate present lower traffic accident and fatality levels, on average. Conclusions: The circulation of this type of vehicle is only advisable in countries where there is a certain degree of maturity and demonstrated achievements in the field of road safety. Practical applications: European countries that have allowed megatruck circulation obtaining better road safety outcomes in terms of accidents, although the accident lethality rate seems to be higher. Consequently, introducing megatruck circulation requires a prior proper preparation and examination.}

The challenge of realizing these advanced manufacturing environments with integrated Exoskeletons is represented by missing design and planning methods required to equip future workplaces with this enabling technology. The integration of Exoskeletons in logistics and production activities creates a new hybrid type of workstation that has to be designed according to a scientific approach. The article presents the first steps in developing an innovative approach to planning and optimizing intelligent working environments with integrated adaptive Exoskeletons. The topic harmonizes three main areas of research: a) production technologies and holistic planning of production processes; b) ergonomics, safety and security of workers in production environments and c) configuration based on the components of the new type of wearable robotics, the Exoskeletons. The validation of this approach is provided through the creation of digital human/Exoskeleton models combining digital Exoskeleton with various digital human models. The Digital Twin of the human/Exoskeleton system is the heart of a holistic design and optimization process that aims to assess the appropriateness of the selected Exoskeleton by simulating the tasks performed and adapting the simulation parameters. An exemplary validation case in one of the most innovative and dynamic sector, the construction sector, demonstrates the applicability of the model. A guideline for migrate the model in other industry sectors is provided, as well.}

Using multiple qualitative data collection approaches, it was found that, motivations for the formation of LMCs include creation of joint efforts to resolve land disputes; desire to benefit from increasing land values; protect the land use rights of settler communities; and operationalize government policy. Inadequate logistics and accommodation owing to limited financial resources, unwillingness of some landowning families to support the LMCs, inadequate skills and difficulty in combining private work with LMC activities, interference in the work of LMCs by land sector agencies were the challenges affecting the operation of the LMCs. The findings suggest that it is significant not just to reconcile private and collective interests in land and forge mutually beneficial relationships in decentralised land governance but also to create mutually supportive incentives for the different stakeholders taking into consideration their unique challenges for collaborative land governance. It is therefore imperative to accommodate the motivations and expectations of the different stakeholders. The LMCs should be recognised as part of the decentralised land governance system and given significant support in their operations.}

abstract = {OBJECTIVES
To determine contemporary costs of preparing for and applying for a urology residency position for the 2019-2020 American Urological Association Match.
METHODS
An electronic survey was emailed to all urology residency applicants who applied to Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School during the 2019-2020 application cycle; it was sent 2 weeks after the Match results were released. We collected information on applicant demographics, interview logistics, and estimated costs incurred applying to residency.
RESULTS
A total of 26% (64/242) of subjects responded, representing all 8 the American Urological Association sections, international schools, and schools without urology programs. 62% were male, 75% were single, and 52% attended public medical school. Applicants paid for the interview trail using loans (67%), family donations (50%), previous or current income (36%), and scholarships (16%). Subjects completed a median of 2 visiting student rotations (IQR 2-3), applied to 80 programs (IQR 66-99), and attended 16 interviews (IQR 13-18.75). The median cost per applicant for the 2019-2020 Match was $9725 (IQR $6134-12,564). This estimate included expenditures on application fees, visiting student rotations, interview trail travel and lodging, research, interview attire, and professional photos. Subjects who attended public medical school were likely to spend $3546.31 (95% confidence interval: 5630.71-1461.916; P < .001) more than those attending private schools.
CONCLUSION
Urology residency applicants spend almost $10,000 in pursuit of a residency position. These high costs not only contribute to student debt but also may deter applicants from entering the field of urology.}

However, Lassa virus is a highly contagious and regulated agent requiring the unique logistics of the biosafety level 4 posing limitations for experimental work. Therefore, we did a detailed auditory analysis of the STAT1 KO mice to assess baseline auditory function in preparation for further auditory behavioral studies. Auditory brainstem response and distortion product otoacoustic emission tests were performed on males and females of the STAT1 KO mice and was compared to 129S6/SvEv wild type (WT) mice. The male WT mice had the best auditory performance and the female WT mice had the worst hearing performance. The male and female STAT1 KO mice had similar auditory performance to each other, which was intermediate between WT males and females.

abstract = {Background
Nutrition literacy is a unique subset of health literacy, a leading predictor of poor health outcomes. Understanding a patient's nutrition literacy may help dietitians provide interventions tailored to a patient's nutrition knowledge weaknesses. While tools exist to evaluate nutrition literacy, it is unclear whether dietitians currently assess patients for nutrition literacy.
Objective
To examine nutrition literacy assessment among practicing outpatient dietitians, barriers to implementing a nutrition literacy survey into clinical practice, and possible solutions to these barriers.
Study Design, Settings, Participants
Semi-structured interviews, divided into four sampling frames, with dietitians (n = 28) from multiple outpatient settings were conducted across two Midwestern states. Similar interviews were conducted with outpatient clinic managers (n = 7), providing a wider viewpoint.
Measurable Outcome/Analysis
Questions addressed clinic work flow, assessing nutrition literacy, and barriers to implementing a survey into practice. All interviews were transcribed, coded, and analyzed by trained study personnel.
Results
All dietitians stated they use no nutrition literacy assessment tools in clinical practice; subjective assessments are used. Barriers to survey implementation included time to complete the survey (79%/n = 22 of interviewees), logistics in administering the survey (75%/n = 21), patient motivation (75%/n = 21), literacy levels of patients (54%/n = 15), and clinic staff support (32/n = 9). Clinic managers stated barriers to survey implementation included patient motivation (86%/n = 6), devoting staff to a non-revenue generating task (71%/n = 5), logistics in administering the survey (71%/n = 5), and time to complete the survey (57%/n = 4). Solutions include survey administration prior to the patient's appointment (79% of dietitians/n = 22, 86% of managers/n = 6), motivating patients to complete the survey prior to their visit (29%/n = 8, 100%/n = 7), and reducing survey length (21%/n = 6, 43%/n = 3).
Conclusion
While multiple barriers to evaluating nutrition literacy in clinical settings exist, potential solutions to these barriers exist. Further research on the implementation of nutrition literacy assessment in the outpatient clinic setting is needed.}

abstract = {Objective
Children with medical complexity (CMC) have high rates of emergency department (ED) utilization, but little evidence exists on the perceptions of parents and pediatric emergency medicine (PEM) physicians about emergency care. We sought to explore parent and PEM physicians’ perspectives about 1) ED care for CMC, and 2) how emergency care can be improved.
Methods
We performed semistructured interviews with parents and PEM physicians at a single academic, children's hospital. English-speaking parents were selected utilizing a standard definition of CMC during an ED visit in which their child was admitted to the hospital. All PEM physicians were eligible. We developed separate interview guides utilizing open-ended questions. The trained study team developed and modified a coding tree through an iterative process, double-coded transcripts, monitored inter-rater reliability to ensure adherence, and performed thematic analysis.
Results
Twenty interviews of parents of CMC and 16 of PEM physicians were necessary for saturation. Parents identified specific challenges related to ED care of their children involving time, information gathering, logistics/convenience, and multifaceted communication between health teams and parents. PEM physicians identified time, data accessibility and availability, and communication as inter-related challenges in caring for CMC in the ED. Suggestions reflected potential solutions to the challenges identified.
Conclusions
Time, data, and communication challenges were the main focus for both parents and PEM physicians, and suggestions mirrored these challenges. Further research and quality improvement efforts to better characterize and mitigate the identified challenges could be of value for this vulnerable population.}

abstract = {Introduction
Achieving high Mass Drug Administration (MDA) coverage and drug uptake are pivotal in the efforts to eradicate onchocerciasis. The present study investigated the extent and predictors of ivermectin MDA coverage and uptake from the individual and healthcare providers' perspectives. The extent of ivermectin distribution and uptake, and the predictors of distribution and uptake were investigated in endemic communities in the Ashanti Region of Ghana.
Methods
A cross-sectional survey was conducted from August to October 2019 in communities within the Atwima Nwabiagya North District. A total of 2008 respondents were interviewed. Data was collected with REDCap mobile App which had an electronic version of the structured questionnaire. Descriptive data was presented in frequency tables, and bivariate and multivariate logistics regression analysis were performed to measure the associations between exposure variables and outcome variables which were received and uptake of MDA drugs.
Results
A total of 1284 (63.9%) respondents did not receive ivermectin during the 2019 MDA programme and more than half of them were not aware of the drug distribution (53.3%). The most common reasons for not ingesting the drug were fear of side effects (47.7%) and not trusting the drug distributors (20.0%). Respondents in the age group 48–57 years (AOR = 1.37; 95%CI: 1.01–2.67), Persons in the high wealth index (AOR = 1.40; 95%CI: 1.11–1.77), Being aware of the MDA programme (AOR = 6.67: 95%CI: 4.76–9.35), MDA being beneficial (AOR = 2.12; 95%CI: 1.54–2.92) participating in previous MDA (AOR = 5.44; 95%CI: 4.25–6.98) and having stayed in the communities for 10 years and above significantly increased the odds of receiving MDA drugs. Previous uptake of MDA drugs (AOR = 10.58; 95%CI: 5.78–19.38) and perception of the MDA drug as beneficial (AOR = 5.25; 95%CI: 2.55–10.82) increased the likelihood of ingesting drugs when received.
Conclusion
The health system challenge - limited awareness creation, affects the optimal utilization of the ivermectin MDA intervention. MDA programmes against onchocerciasis eradication should be designed taking into account specific contextual factors to improve implementation outcomes.}

It has been established that unfettered competition among ports in proximity leads to unnecessary duplication of effort and waste of scarce port resources. We adopt the Difference-in-Differences (DID) model to analyze the effect of PI on urban economic growth, as well as to identify the causes of spatial differences in urban development, possibly due to PI. We have analyzed datasets from 69 port cities in China, from 2000 to 2018. Our results show that PI can significantly advance the economic growth of port cities, and its effects increase with time. We also show that port integration has a clear positive effect on the economic growth of cities in the Yangtze River Delta region (YRD), particularly on small- and medium-sized cities. The economic effects of PI on cities in the Bohai Rim region (BR) and on big cities is, instead, insignificant. This result indicates the existence of strong spatial differences in the impacts of PI. Moreover, we show that PI has positive effects on the rationalization of port resources and their allocation among regional ports, promoting, in this way too, urban economic growth. In China, in particular, the country's port integration strategy has effectively driven the development of numerous ports, and it has successfully contributed to the development of the country's strong transportation network. Our findings provide useful guidelines to ports around the world, in their process of integrating and consolidating their port-, transport- and logistics sectors.}

This micro fuel cell technology utilizes microfluidic flows as electrolyte instead of conventional polymer membranes. To date, various fuels have been utilized in it, such as vanadium species, hydrogen, hydrocarbons, hydrogen peroxide, borohydride and nitrogenous materials, each of which has its specific merits and demerits. To optimize its power output and fuel utilization, innovative cell structures and advanced catalysts have been continuously developed for different fuels, with remarkable improvements achieved. The power output can be elevated from several mW cm−2 to several W cm−2 at room temperature, while the fuel utilization per single pass can reach 100% by using 3D flow-through electrodes. Also, investigations in recent years have shown that microfluidic fuel cell stacking increases the working voltage. In addition to cells with plastic channel, novel cell designs based on cellulose paper and fabric materials have also been proposed; apart from being lightweight, they are also free from pumping. These innovative cell designs represent a promising route for achieving real applications in areas such as medical diagnostic, wearable healthcare and smart logistics. As for the conventional plastic cells, they are currently less competitive against batteries and other fuel cells because of the extra pumping requirement, which should be resolved in future by developing passive pumps instead. Alternatively, they can be applied in specific circumstances where the extra pumping loss is tolerable.}

In conclusion, the article determines that a key issue is that the constraints for alternative energy sources reinforce each other, while the actors working for them find themselves in an isolated position. This is especially true for the institutional and financial constraints. However, by examining the enabling factors it is possible to see how the bundle of constraints could also be undone together. Most efficient way for success would likely be helping municipalities and actors in the fields of biomass and energy production to form joint clusters and share resources.}

Using a panel technique, this study investigates the drivers underlying the certification of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) standard by plantation companies in Malaysia. We examine the period between 2007 and 2016. Panel logistics analysis allows for changes in variables, including company capacity (proportion of planted area and debt-to-equity ratio) and the time-dependent price of crude palm oil. Despite the fact that these variables influence adoption, our findings reveal that adoption is found to be elastic to changes only in proportion to the planted area. Plantation companies that have undertaken conservation efforts may present “low-hanging fruits”. Given the currently limited response to adoption, a partially targeted approach encompassing education and technical assistance, financial assistance, and regulation is recommended to create a more inclusive  and enabling environment.}

The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm can facilitate implementing the Product Service Systems (PSS) model to achieve Circular Economy through closed-loop material flow. Implementing PSS in IoT-enabled environments will require a new approach to supply chain network design. PSS implementation requires more complex design of reverse logistics operations to enable reuse, remanufacture and recycle options for end-of-life (EoL) products. Therefore, establishing optimal location of facilities for these operations is critical to achieve efficiency and sustainability objectives. This study develops an approach for optimizing the locations of end-of-life product recovery facilities for implementing PSS. A multi-objective optimization model that considers social, environmental and economic criteria including lead time of reusable products which is the time between collection of EoL products and the time they reach secondary markets, as objectives is formulated considering relevant constraints. The proposed model is applicable to different sectors such as appliances or electronics manufacturing. The methodology is demonstrated by application to a case study of the Turkish appliance sector. Results from different scenarios are tested and evaluated to gain a better insight of implications due to location selection decisions.}

abstract = {Introduction
Evidence-based guidelines advocate percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as the mainstay reperfusion strategy for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). However, the South African health system is not well positioned to provide PCI as a ‘mainstay strategy’. In response, the Health Professions Council of South Africa approved the use of prehospital thrombolysis (PHT) for emergency care practitioners in 2009. However, since its approval, prehospital thrombolysis has failed to reach a level of systematic uptake indicative of successful implementation. The current study aimed to explore, through a qualitative inquiry, barriers to PHT for the treatment of myocardial infarction within a South African context.
Methods
A qualitative single-case study design was used where a series of semi-structured interviews were conducted involving purposefully selected participants. The case comprised a nationalised private emergency medical service, and participants were selected in view of relevant experience and knowledge. Requisite data was conceptualised through the consolidated framework for implementation research, and thematic analysis outlined the data coding procedures of the study.
Results
The study identified potential barriers to the implementation of PHT. These comprised cost, logistics, inter-professional collaboration, leadership engagement, and beliefs or scepticism associated with PHT.
Conclusion
A lack of strategic implementation has resulted in a poor introduction of evidenced-based prehospital cardiac care, affecting vulnerable populations who may have otherwise benefited from receiving this level of care. Given the time-sensitive nature of STEMI management, and severely limited access to ‘primary reperfusion’, PHT resembles not only a logical but also appealing solution in the South African context.}

This article aims to survey the areas of research in which there is the greatest amount of knowledge and those lines where there are gaps to fill. For this purpose, an analysis of the articles in both national and international journals were performed, besides proceedings of conferences on related topics. In the first case, national journals has been carried out for the last twelve years, using the Sucupira Platform of the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development – CNPq as a reference, identifying the Journal of Transport Literature and Transportes. For the international references, five international journals of high impact were verified. Papers were also raised in the proceedings of the last three years in the Conference of Research and Education in Transportation (ANPET) and in the Symposium in Air Transport (SITRAER) for 2019. The search filters were delimited by keywords in common use in journals. The classification of areas of knowledge was defined based on international literature, with four areas defined: Airline, Airports, Aircraft and Air Navigation. The following lines of research were also defined: Mobility, Safety, Sustainability, Industry/services, Economy, Policies, Environment and Social Development. The results show that 86% of the studies focused on research in the areas of Airlines and Airports, of which, of this total, more than 47% have Economics as their research line; the remaining 14% dealt with Aircraft and Air Navigation. Cargo transportation corresponds to only 3% of publications. The results showed gaps in the lines of research in Mobility, Social Development, Environment and Sustainability; in addition, security research focuses on the airport environment, with no publication in airlines. Cargo transportation needs to be further studied, especially when modal integration logistics is a necessity in a globalized world.}

Lobelioideae is the largest subfamily within Campanulaceae that includes the endemic Hawaiian lobeliads, which are a group of woody eudicots comprised of six genera and 141 species (Gustafson et al., 2014; Kagame et al., 2021). The origins of Hawaiian lobeliads have been debated by many; but regardless, they are viewed as one of the most remarkable examples of adaptive radiation in plants (Givnish et al., 2008). Cyanea is the most species rich genus of the Hawaiian lobeliads, and out of the 80 recognized species, 54 are federally listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act (Sporck-Koehler et al., 2015). Cyanea tritomantha is endemic to the island of Hawaiʻi and was listed as an endangered species in 2013. Currently, there are 17 wild populations of C. tritomantha with less than 400 total individuals that occur in lowland wet, montane wet, and wet cliff habitat on the windward slopes of Mauna Kea, Mauna Loa, and the Kohala Mountains (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), 2013a, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), 2020i). Threats to this species include habitat loss and degradation resulting from non-native species, herbivory and predation by non-native species, small numbers of individuals and populations, and pollinator deficiency. Conservation efforts to recover the species have included collaborative management through partnerships and programs, outplanting and genetic seed storage, and fencing and ungulate control. However, implementing these efforts are difficult due to the remoteness of populations, and high cost and challenging logistics. Although it is difficult to maintain these actions over time, together they can provide a framework to restore rare plant species like C. tritomantha and ensure they are around for future generations.}

abstract = {Parameters for defining photovoltaic models using measured voltage–current​ characteristics are essential for simulation, control, and evaluation of photovoltaic-based systems. This paper proposes an enhanced chaotic JAYA algorithm to classify the parameters of various photovoltaic models, such as the single-diode and double-diode models, accurately and reliably. The proposed algorithm introduces a self-adaptive weight to regulate the trend to reach the optimal solution and avoid the worst solution in various phases of the search space. The self-adaptive weight capability also allows the proposed technique to reach the best solution at the earliest phase, and later, the local search process starts, which also increase the ability to explore. A three different chaotic process, including sine, logistics and tent map, is proposed to optimize the consistency of each generation’s best solution. The proposed algorithm and its variants proposed are used to solve the parameter estimation problem of various PV models. To show the proficiency of the suggested algorithm and its variants, an extensive simulation is carried out using MATLAB/Simulink software. Two statistical tests are conducted and compared with the latest techniques for validating the performance of the suggested algorithm and its variants. Comprehensive analysis and experimental results display that the suggested algorithm can achieve highly competitive efficiency in terms of accuracy and reliability compared to other algorithms in the literature.

Inca provincial expansion in the Collasuyu has largely been explained by the need to intensify mining to satisfy their metallurgical demand. Despite the evidence for many mines and metallurgical activities during the Late Horizon in the southern Andes, it is still not clear how their production was organized and articulated. By studying one of the most important metallurgical centers in northern Chile, Viña del Cerro, we determined the following: first, the metal obtained was unalloyed copper; and second, there is no relevant evidence for the manufacturing of final artifacts in the site, or at any of the major Inca settlements in the Copiapó valley. We argue that tin bronze artifacts in Copiapó were likely imported from abroad and that the local copper production was likely taken elsewhere for processing and final manufacture. New radiocarbon dates indicate that Inca metallurgical activities in Copiapó valley co-opted a previous local site and technology. However, the Incas did not establish an intense occupation there. This case evidences the logistics and challenges of developing a political economy based on wealth finance in the far corners of the Inca Empire, where decentralizing the chaîne opératoire seemed to be the chosen strategy for economic control.}

abstract = {The flying sidekick traveling salesman problem (FS-TSP) is a parcel delivery problem arising in the last-mile logistics, where the distribution plan of a driver-operated truck assisted by a drone (unmanned aerial vehicle, UAV) has to be defined. The FS-TSP is a variant of the TSP where routing decisions are integrated with customer-to-drone and customer-to-truck assignment decisions and truck-and-drone synchronization constraints. The objective is the minimization of the time required to serve all the customers, taking into account drone payload capacity and battery power constraints. In this work we provide a new representation of the FS-TSP based on the definition of an extended graph. This representation allows to model the problem by a new and compact integer linear programming formulation, where the synchronization issue is tackled in a column generation fashion, thus avoiding the usage of big-M constraints, representing one of the main drawbacks of the models present in literature. The proposed formulation has been solved by an exact approach which combines a Branch-and-Cut algorithm and a column generation procedure, strengthened by variable fixing strategies and new valid inequalities specifically defined for the problem. The proposed method has been experienced on a large set of benchmark instances. Computational results show that the proposed approach either is competitive or outperforms the best exact approach present in literature for the FS-TSP. Indeed, it is able to provide the optimal solution for all small size instances with 10 customers and for several medium size instances with 20 customers, some of them never solved before.}

As such, this study addresses user satisfaction as an attribute to understand organizational buyers' continuance intentions of e-procurement systems in a mandated usage setting. Furthermore, the mediating roles of individuals' perception in the relationship between system characteristics and satisfaction are investigated. We distinct our work with prior literature on e-procurement by focusing on organizational buyers' continued usage intentions, rather than investigating the e-procurement adoption issues at the firm level. Also, our research is positioned in a unique context since it investigates a system that is generally mandatory in nature. While a system may have been implemented successfully and its use may have been mandated, it may actually not be used to its fullest extent, leaving significant potential unrealized.

The discussion regarding the introduction of truck platooning has thus far been largely centered on the long-haul segment. However, at the European Union level, many freight routes are of a short distance, covering only a few hundred kilometers. Understanding the limitations of the use of truck platooning is therefore necessary. This chapter reports on research aimed at assessing the feasibility of truck platooning on short-distance routes. The method is based on a case study of a Portuguese logistics operator. Because of the small size of the country, the maximum distance is of 250km. A microsimulation model, using discrete event simulation, was developed to estimate the length of truck platooning segments. Calculations for a typical day suggest that trucks could run around 40% of the distance platooned. The fuel savings could offset technology costs (e.g., onboard equipment) in a time frame of around 3years.}

Digitalization can make a decisive contribution to mastering this complexity and also offers a number of approaches to conserve resources and avoid waste at all levels of the organization. Simulations in the product development can help to optimize the material usage. The simulation of logistics and production processes helps to avoid waste in the material flow. The increasing use of low-cost sensors enables comprehensive data to be obtained on material movements and energy consumption. These data can be evaluated via big data analyses in order to develop approaches for the control and regulation of material flows and energy consumption. The visualization of data in energy management systems brings transparency, which shows new approaches for optimization. In order to improve one’s own competitiveness through digitalization a strategic approach is required. Several models and tools are available for the development of a company-wide strategy for digitalization. The Lower Saxony Learning Factory for Resource Efficiency (“NiFaR“) has analyzed models and tools to use them for suitable applications in the production environment of the Factory. By using sensor technology and artificial intelligence and by visualizing the results, NiFaR enables its visitors to experience and comprehend the potential of digitalization for the purpose of resource efficiency. It also offers training on this topic for consultants and employees of companies, ranging from the presentation of different digitalization approaches to practical implementation examples.}

abstract = {Background
Coronavirus disease 2019 is revolutionizing healthcare delivery. The aim of this study was to reach a consensus among experts as to the possible applications of telemedicine in the proctologic field.
Methods
A group of 55 clinical practice recommendations was developed by a clinical guidance group based on coalescence of evidence and expert opinion. The Telemedicine in Proctology Italian Working Group included 47 Italian Society of Colorectal Surgery nominated experts evaluating the appropriateness of each clinical practice recommendations based on published RAND/UCLA methodology in 2 rounds.
Results
Stakeholder median age was 53 years (interquartile range limits 40–60), and 38 (81%) were men. Nine (19%) panelists reported no experience with telemedicine before the pandemic. Agreement was obtained on a minimum of 3 to 5 years of practice in the proctologic field before starting teleconsultations, which should be regularly paid, with advice and prescriptions incorporated into a formal report sent to the patient by e-mail along with a receipt. Of the panelists, 35 of 47 (74%) agreed that teleconsultation carries the risk of misdiagnosis of cancer, thus recommending an in-person assessment before scheduling any surgery. Fifteen additional clinical practice recommendations were re-elaborated in the second round and assessed by 44 of 47 (93.6%) panelists. The application of telemedicine for the diagnosis of common proctologic conditions (eg, hemorrhoidal disease, anal abscess and fistula, anal condylomas, and anal fissure) and functional pelvic floor disorders was generally considered inappropriate. Teleconsultation was instead deemed appropriate for the diagnosis and management of pilonidal disease.
Conclusion
This e-consensus revealed the boundaries of telemedicine in Italy. Standardization of infrastructures, logistics, and legality remain to be better elucidated.}

Understanding value chains, identifying pressure points and room for improvement using new technological solutions, are important steps to enhance raw material utilization for the individual industries. Marine resources generated from the fish industry is an important part of the Norwegian food production and contributes about 4% to mainland gross domestic product. The most important industries are Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) aquaculture, and wild capture of pelagic fish, cod (Gadus morhua) and saithe (Pollachius virens). Processing to saleable products, mainly fillets, generates large amounts of marine rest raw material. Logistics of aquaculture production and processing allow for close to 100% utilization, while only 44% of the white fish rest raw material is being utilized. Farming of fish close to shore enable processing of rest raw material immediately after slaughter, which is paramount to avoid deterioration. Cod and Saithe are mainly caught at sea by sea trawlers and the coastal fleet, with on-board handling and transportation to shore being hurdles to overcome for processing of rest raw material to high quality products for human consumption and animal feed. This review will focus on the value chain of the white fish industry in Norway, its history, current status and possibilities of improvement to better utilize rest raw material.}

Method
Interviews were conducted with staff from residential aged care and logistics/transport organisations in Australia. Transcripts were analysed using a worker-centred systems framework.
Results and conclusions
Many barriers to more effective risk management were identified. Most fundamentally, few people knew of the need to manage MSD risk arising from work-related psychosocial hazards, and OHS-related skills of key managers were often reported as inadequate, particularly concerning management of risk from psychosocial hazards. Also, funding and staffing levels were often reported as problematic, and OHS issues were seen as lower priority than accreditation and commercial requirements.}

Scrotal ultrasound helps in the rapid diagnosis of complete testicular torsion and assessment of alternative causes of acute scrotal pain. Early detection of torsion of the testis and reperfusion, either manually or surgically, is paramount to preserving testicular viability. Manual detorsion also offers immediate symptom relief by alleviating ischemia. Bedside ultrasound performed by a trained emergency physician (EP) can significantly reduce the time to diagnosis and reperfusion by means of performing an ultrasound-guided manual detorsion in the emergency department (ED).
Case Report
We report two cases of ultrasound-guided manual detorsion of testis that were performed successfully by EPs in the ED. After manual detorsion, both patients underwent nonemergent orchidopexy and recovered well after surgery.
Why Should an Emergency Physician Be Aware of This?
Manual testicular detorsion is a simple, safe, and effective maneuver that can be performed in the ED by EPs. Bedside ultrasound is helpful in confirming the diagnosis of complete torsion of the testicle (no blood flow) and successful reperfusion after manual detorsion. We recommend EPs be trained to perform scrotal ultrasound and manual detorsion of a torted testicle. We strongly emphasize that manual detorsion of the testes is not a substitute for definitive surgical management and should only be used as a temporary measure for reperfusion to allow more time to organize the logistics of surgery, which can be critical in remote settings.}

However, the dilemma of short time requirement and massive tags makes traditional one-by-one identification methods impractical. Meanwhile, existing off-the-shelf methods cannot count and classify RFID tags at the same time. In this paper, RFID classification statistics problem is defined as classifying the tags into distinct groups and counting the quantity of tags in each group by the reader. The issue of time efficiency is significant in classification statistics, especially when the number of tags is large. To address this problem, we propose a novel Twins Accelerating Gears (TAG) approach. One gear shortens the classification process in frequency domain through subcarrier allocation, when another gear accelerates the statistics process in time domain through geometric distribution based quantity estimation. TAG can handle classification and quantity estimation during one process while existing methods need to handle it separately. We give elaborate proof of the running time and quantity estimation value of the process in theory. Typically, the total time of TAG is O(log⁡N) and TAG outperforms existing identification solutions about 99.8% time reduction on 1000 tags classified statistics.}

This framework was tested by means of interviews with members of a variety of recycling cooperatives, which are themselves parts of larger networks. The main proposition is that RG is the core process underlying networks that deal with tensions related to sustainability issues, guiding activities, decision-making, roles and the behavior of members of the network. This work contributes to the relevant literature by introducing an innovative way to manage tensions arising from networks’ sustainability issues, by means of the relational governance structure. The relevance of this article is in proposing a framework that offers a solution to manage the tensions within recycling cooperatives, based on the RG perspective. The framework was tested in four Brazilian networks that work with recycling. An indicator matrix presented in this article represents the methodological and managerial contributions of this study. This matrix assists in evaluating cohesion and conflict resolution by members of cooperatives, based on the levels of the RG framework.}

abstract = {Nowadays, energy efficiency is a crucial factor for the competitiveness of manufacturing firms, due to the rising of world energy prices and as a consequence of the environmental consciousness concerned with the consumption of non-renewable energy resources. The furnaces for steel reheating are responsible for a large amount of energy consumption, where less than 50% of the energy supplied to the furnace (mainly gaseous fuel) is net energy of steel heating, the remaining is lost. A consistent set of studies, which investigates energy reduction initiatives for the reheating furnaces, can be found in literature. However, almost all the studies are focused on technology alternatives (such as regenerative burners), whereas some others focus their attention on measurement and control action, mainly obtained by IT investments. This study aims at providing a mathematical model for a reheating furnace, by considering the efficiency-temperature relationships of the furnace. The model permits the user to identify the most proper optimization of the temperature-time relations, in the different productive situations, capable of guaranteeing the most energy-efficient reheating operations by preserving logistics performances. In order to make a cost-benefit analysis, different options for the furnace setting and related process operations have been considered with reference to a specific industrial case. The model highlights how improving the operating policies for controlling the key process parameters may lead to energy savings and, consequently, economic benefits, as well as pursuing environmental preservation thanks to the rational use of non-renewable resources.}

The existing literature related to RAs has focused on the design aspects, fleet sizing, allocation of RAs, repositioning of empty RAs, and their end-of-life stages. This paper focuses on the fleet-sizing problem of RAs under uncertain demand and turnaround times. Probability theory-based analytical models are developed to determine the optimal fleet size of RAs in both lost-sales and back-order cases. The proposed analytical procedure can be used to develop models to find the optimal fleet sizes for any demand scenario with a known distribution. In the lost-sales case, analytical models are developed for uniform and normally distributed demand scenarios. A simulation model is developed to test the effectiveness of the average on-hand inventory in service-level estimation. Sensitivity analysis of the average on-hand inventory for the changes in demand and turnaround times have also been conducted and the key managerial insights are summarized. Analytical models are also developed for the back-order case and some specific managerial insights are presented.}

abstract = {In order to deal with the increasingly intensive market competition and make rapid response to customers, the automobile manufacturing enterprises in China begin to explore new methods of material supply to meet the management requirements of precision and efficient production. For this purpose, an RFID-based material delivery method for mixed-model automobile assembly is proposed in this paper. The assembly line material classification and its distribution pattern are analyzed, and the production progress data acquisition scheme with RFID is designed. Based on the periodic inventory monitoring strategy, a buffer inventory demand model and an optimized delivery plan are formed to provide accurate material feeding service for the assembly line. In addition, an RFID-based material distribution prototype software for automobile mixed-model assembly line is developed and applied. This software has realized the RFID information collection, buffer material requirements management, as well as the logistics distribution and replenishment plan. It provides a feasible method and solution for automobile enterprises.}

This highly advanced way of shipping will present a very different logistics environment with respective challenges for maritime ports. For those investing in or operating port systems, it is important to understand whether different service quality aspects will be important in this future system, compared to today. Our paper deals with the port performance evaluation and selection problem. Although it has been studied extensively in a contemporary context, there has been no exploration of the criteria and preferences of decision-makers in the future shipping environment of the PI. Our objective is to define these criteria and explore their weighting in this new context. We propose two distinct autonomous decision-makers for port performance evaluation and selection in the PI: intelligent containers and vessels. We identify future port performance evaluation and selection criteria, and analyse their weighting based on an expert survey, complementing the extant literature on port performance evaluation and selection, and the PI. We use the Bayesian Best-Worst Method (BWM) to derive weights for the criteria. We find that, compared to the current port performance evaluation and selection literature, in a first stage in the modelling of intelligent agents’ performance preferences, subtle differences in weights mark the step from the present towards the PI. Partly, this is reassuring for port authorities as they can manage largely the same set of performance indicators to be attractive for both decision-makers. However, the results also show differences between agents, with an increased importance of, in particular, Level of Service, Network Interconnectivity, and Information Systems.}

abstract = {Introduction
As a convenient and affordable means of transportation, the e-bike is widely used by different age rider groups and for different travel purposes. The underlying reasons for e-bike riders suffering from severe injury may be different in each case.
Method
This study aims to examine the underlying risk factors of severe injury for different groups of e-bike riders by using a combined method, integration of a classification tree and a logistic regression model. Three-year of e-bike crashes occurring in Hunan province are extracted, and risk factor including rider’s attribute, opponent vehicle and driver’s attribute, improper behaviors of riders and drivers, road, and environment characteristics are considered for this analysis.
Results
E-bike riders are segmented into five groups based on the classification tree analysis, and the group of non-occupational riders aged over 55 in urban regions is associated with the highest likelihood of severe injury among the five groups. The logistics analysis for each group shows that several risk factors such as high-speed roads have commonly significant effects on injury severity for different groups; while major factors only have significant effects for specific groups.
Practical application
Based on model results, policy implications to alleviate the crash injury for different e-bike riders groups are recommended, which mainly include enhanced education and enforcement for e-bike risky behaviors, and traffic engineering to regulate the use of e-bikes on high speed roads.}

abstract = {A new model of tissue-engineered artificial autologous human skin developed in Andalusia is currently being transplanted into patients suffering from large burns within the Andalusian Public Healthcare System. This product is considered an advanced therapy medicinal product (ATMP) in Europe, and its clinical use implies meeting transplant and medicinal product legal requirements, being the Guidelines of Good Manufacturing Practice for ATMPs of particular importance. The preclinical research and clinical translation of the product have represented a technical, regulatory, and organizational challenge, which has taken 10 years since the first preclinical experiments were designed. Twelve patients with large burns, including 3 pediatric patients, have hitherto received artificial autologous skin grafts with an overall survival rate of 75% and positive clinical, homeostatic, and histologic results. Achieving such a milestone within our Healthcare System was possible through a multidisciplinary approach and the joint efforts of multiple publicly funded institutions and units under the coordination of the Andalusian Initiative for Advanced Therapies. In this article, we present the organizational model set up to facilitate collaboration and logistics among the professionals involved, totaling more than 80 people. The similarities between the tissue-engineered artificial autologous human skin transplant and other organ and tissue transplants, in terms of logistic requirements, reveal how regional and hospital transplant coordination have played a crucial role.}

abstract = {Open burning of agricultural residues after harvesting season is usually practiced as a disposal means for highland farms. The practice has partially contributed to the haze problem in the northern region of Southeast Asia during February to April every year. This can drastically affect human health in the long run. In this work, alternative means to utilize maize residues as a bio-renewable fuel source is explored. These maize residues can potentially be used as a raw material to substitute or partially replace wood chips in production of smokeless charcoal. Local charcoal producers in Maehongson, northern Thailand have recently looked into alternative raw materials for smokeless charcoal production since the demand for domestic and aboard has shoot up to about 6000 tons this year. Possibility of using maize residues is paramount. According to such requirement, this work focused on cost analysis of transforming maize residues into high-added-value smokeless charcoal. The analysis covered from maize harvesting and residue collection methods, logistics approach to charcoal production site, production cost and product transportation cost. Primary and secondary data collection, site survey, interviews with stakeholders and cost modeling were performed. It was found that the maize farmers could earn up to 15 USD/ton from sales of the maize residues to charcoal production plants, while the plants remain profitable.}

abstract = {Business models such as C2B and B2B2C, in which consumers get involved in companies' supply chains and business operations, are burgeoning in many industries. Academic research on the phenomenon is, however, lagging behind, and extant research has typically focused on just one or a few variants of such business models at a time. The present conceptual research addresses this research gap by developing a comprehensive typology that explicates and unpacks the full variety of consumer involvement types in supply networks of contemporary business models. The three-dimensional typology developed contributes to literature by identifying and integrating the relevant dimensions, which have been addressed in prior research only implicitly or in a piecemeal manner. This elucidates the full range and variety of the phenomenon to researchers. For managers, the three-dimensional, cubic typology offers a business development tool, facilitating the identification of altogether 56 alternative business models, wherein consumers may serve as suppliers of various inputs, including work, effort, and entrepreneurial activity; goods; platform goods; natural resources and energy; data, information, and knowledge; attention and presence; as well as money and capital.}

In this paper, based on the beneficiary pays principle, we use biogas production from crop straw as an example and analyze households' willingness to pay (WTP) for the local government-led project on energy utilization of crop straw. “Interpersonal trust” and “institutional trust” variables are introduced to improve the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model, on the basis of which, Probit and Interval Regression Models are employed to explore the determinants of households' WTP. Results show that: 1) Most households are willing to pay for biogas utilization of crop straw, and the average expected value of households' WTP is about 20.72 RMB per household monthly; 2) Crop straw program cost and benefit trade-offs, convenience of logistics and technology, and trust factors all play an important role in households’ WTP; 3) If the cultivation of trust is neglected, even if households have high expectations for the ecological performance of biogas production from crop straw, their WTP will not be improved. Conclusions are summarized to provide an important reference for the formulation of policies to improve energy utilization of crop straw in developing countries or regions.}

abstract = {Adults with mobility related disabilities (MRDs) represent an underserved group with a high prevalence of overweight/obesity and limited options for weight management. We previously demonstrated clinically meaningful 12-month weight loss in adults with MRDs (−6.2%, 36% ≥5% of baseline weight) using an enhanced Stop Light Diet (eSLD) delivered using at home face-to-face behavioral sessions and optional physical activity. However, the costs/logistics associated with intervention delivery by individual home visits limits the potential for scaling and implementation of this approach. Thus, we will conduct a two-arm randomized trial in 128 overweight/obese adults with MRDs to compare weight loss (6 mos.) and maintenance (12 mos.) between interventions utilizing the eSLD, behavioral counseling, and increased physical activity delivered to individual participants in their homes or delivered to groups of participants in their homes remotely via video conferencing. The primary aim will compare weight loss between interventions arms across 6 months. Secondarily, we will compare weight loss (0–18 mos.), the proportion of participants who achieve clinically meaningful weight loss (≥5%) from 0 to 6 and 0 to18 months, and changes in quality of life from 0 to 6 and 0 to 18 months between interventions arms. We will also conduct cost, cost-effectiveness and contingent valuation comparisons and explore the influence of behavioral session attendance, compliance with the recommendations for diet and physical activity, self-monitoring of diet and physical activity, barriers to physical activity, sleep quality, and medications on weight change across 6 and 18 months.
