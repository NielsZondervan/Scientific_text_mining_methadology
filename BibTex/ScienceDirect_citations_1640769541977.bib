abstract = {The applicability of immersed boundary method (IBM) in solving flow over complex and moving geometries is often restricted due to the computational overheads associated with the dynamic identification of immersed nodes and the high ratio of solid to fluid nodes. Furthermore, improper mass conservation and the unphysical pressure fluctuations result in large errors in IBM based flow predictions. Earlier attempts to overcome these issues were usually mathematically involved and computationally expensive. In the present paper, a simple and robust IBM implementation has been demonstrated which addresses these issues. The present method preserves the simplicity of sharp interface immersed boundary method and hence avoids complex coding logistics. This method uses a dynamic search algorithm for tagging of the immersed nodes and reduces the computational overheads. Mass conservation is ensured in the intercepted cells through a hybrid SOLA–MAC algorithm. The proposed algorithm iteratively satisfies the mass conservation equation in the intercepted cell and also eliminates spurious fluctuations in the temporal behavior of pressure. An overall second order accuracy is maintained in the discretization and interpolation schemes. The effectiveness and accuracy of the present scheme in handling the mass loss and spurious pressure fluctuation are demonstrated through a number of test cases. Comparisons are made with available experimental and numerical data for different external and internal flow problems.}

abstract = {Introduction
Optimizing placement of Automated External Defibrillators (AED) can increase survival after an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Using postal collection boxes (PCB) as locations for AEDs could potentially enhance accessibility and streamline maintenance. In this study, we modeled the hypothetical effects of deploying AEDs at PCB locations.
Hypothesis
We hypothesized that PCB-AEDs would increase AED coverage overall and in residential areas, and reduce the distance from OHCA to an AED.
Methods
AEDs in Pittsburgh, PA were identified by the University of Pittsburgh Resuscitation Logistics and Informatics Venture (n=747). PCB locations were obtained from the United States Postal Service (n=479). OHCA locations from 2009 to 2014 were obtained from the Pittsburgh site of the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium. AED coverage assuming a ¼ mile radius around each AED was estimated for known AEDs, PCB-AEDs (hypothetical AED locations), and known AEDs augmented by PCB-AEDs, both overall and for residential and non-residential zones. Linear distance from each OHCA to the nearest AED was calculated and compared between the sets.
Results
The set of known AEDs augmented with PCB-AEDs covered more of the city overall (55% vs 30%), as well as greater proportions of residential (62% vs 27%) and non-residential areas (45% vs 30%). The median distance from OHCA to AED was significantly shorter when known AEDs were augmented with PCB-AEDs (0.12mi vs 0.32mi; p=0.001).
Conclusion
Augmenting existing publicly accessible AEDs with AEDs deployed at PCBs can increase AED spatial coverage in both residential and non-residential areas, and reduce the distance from AED to OHCA.}

abstract = {We investigate a three-echelon manufacturing and remanufacturing closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) constituting of a retailer, a manufacturer and a supplier. Each echelon, apart from its usual operations in the forward SC (FSC), has its own reverse logistics (RL) operations. We assume that RL information is transparent to the FSC, and the same replenishment policies are used throughout the supply chain. We focus on the impact on dynamic performance of uncertainties in the return yield, RL lead time and the product consumption lead time. Two outcomes are studied: order rate and serviceable inventory. The results suggest that higher return yield improves dynamic performance in terms of overshoot and risk of stock-out with a unit step response as input. However, when the return yield reaches a certain level, the classic bullwhip propagation normally associated with the FSC does not always hold. The longer remanufacturing and product consumption lead times result in a higher overshoot and a longer time to recover inventory, as well as more oscillation in the step response at the upstream echelons. We also study bullwhip and inventory variance when demand is a random variable. Our analysis suggests that higher return yield contributes to reduced bullwhip and inventory variance at the echelon level but for the CLSC as a whole the level of bullwhip may decrease as well as increase as it propagates along the supply chain. The reason for such behaviour is due to the interaction of the various model parameters and should be the subject of further analytical research. Furthermore, by studying the three-echelon CLSC, we produce a general equation for eliminating inventory offsets in an n-echelon CLSC. This is helpful to managers who wish to maintain inventory service levels in multi-echelon CLSCs.}

abstract = {Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease that offers an excellent paradigm for cell replacement therapy because of the associated relatively focal cell loss in the striatum. The predominant cells lost in this condition are striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs). Transplantation of developing MSNs taken from the fetal brain has provided proof of concept that donor MSNs can survive, integrate and bring about a degree of functional recovery in both pre-clinical studies and in a limited number of clinical trials. The scarcity of human fetal tissue, and the logistics of coordinating collection and dissection of tissue with neurosurgical procedures makes the use of fetal tissue for this purpose both complex and limiting. Alternative donor cell sources which are expandable in culture prior to transplantation are currently being sought. Two potential donor cell sources which have received most attention recently are embryonic stem (ES) cells and adult induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, both of which can be directed to MSN-like fates, although achieving a genuine MSN fate has proven to be difficult. All potential donor sources have challenges in terms of their clinical application for regenerative medicine, and thus it is important to continue exploring a wide variety of expandable cells. In this review we discuss two less well-reported potential donor cell sources; embryonic germ (EG) cells and fetal neural precursors (FNPs), both are which are fetal-derived and have some properties that could make them useful for regenerative medicine applications.}

abstract = {There are plentiful of palm biomass but these resources are not always being fully utilised. Palm biomass are plentiful; yet their utilization are far from reaching their potential. From the perspective of biomass industry players, especially of the bio-energy industry, there are primarily three factors affecting their business decision: (i) constant and good quality supplies, (ii) process efficiency, (iii) market demand and price. The strategy considerations that respond to these factors are based on other players' competition, plantation output, mill output, logistics matter, government policy and weather. In order to model a real situation in a particular palm plantation area, game theory approach is adopted in analysing and identifying the best strategy for the biomass industry owner. Given that every player tends to act according to their own self-interest for profit maximization, this is thus a non-cooperative game study. The case study in this paper is modelled on two industry players, two oil mills and two plantations. Nash equilibrium is achieved through analysing the best strategy. The strategy selected by the player will lead to the most favorable and positive outcome regardless of whatever decision made by the opponents. In other word, by analysing this scenario using game theory approach, an optimal non-cooperative strategy can be determined. For the future works, it can be applied into the decision support framework for the biomass industry management team.}

Oocytes (n = 3171) recovered by ovum pickup (n = 112) from Girolando (Holstein–Gir) females (n = 36) were selected and submitted to IVM for 24 hours at 38.5 °C with 5% CO2 in air with saturated humidity. In vitro fertilization was performed with the thawed, sexed semen from 5 Holstein bulls. After IVF, presumptive zygotes were denuded and cultured for 7 days under the same IVM and IVF conditions of temperature and humidity, except with 5% CO2 and 5% O2. Grade I blastocysts were randomly assigned for either the transferred fresh, vitrified/thawing, or frozen/directly embryo transfer into previously synchronized recipient females. Conception rates were analyzed by binomial logistic regression, and a probability level of P < 0.05 was considered significant. The conception rates were 51.35 ± 1.87% (133/259) for the fresh embryos, 35.89 ± 3.87% (84/234) for the vitrified embryos, and 40.19 ± 4.65% (125/311) for the frozen directly transferred embryos. These data demonstrate that IVP embryos with sexed semen could be directly transferred into recipient cows with similar conception rates to vitrified embryos. The comparison found that the use of frozen embryos in direct transfer provides easier logistics and a more practical approach for the transfer of IVP embryos on dairy farms.}

The IoT research carried out with such an experimental data results in significant decrease in accuracy and reliability of data analysis performed. Most of the big data analytics algorithms applied for data collected through sensors and actuators assume that the data is complete such that each property of the instances are filled with appropriate value. These data has temporal and spatial correlation between them. Most of the research carried out in the context of missing value imputation did not consider the characteristics of IoT data itself. The planned work bases its development using an aspect oriented software development approach and addresses the issues involved in the estimation of missing data point during the service discovery. The proposal analyses the situation of missing data completely at random and appropriately weaves the aspect and the application together thereby decreasing the complexity in handling the missing data issues. The woven aspect estimates the missing data using context and linear mean technique and updates the information. The observation on experimental results reveals significant improvement in response time compared to deriving the missing data in a conventional manner.}

The classification and availability of biomass feedstock for these products are key factors in determining the most effective application for biomass. The classification of the feedstock provides relative insight on the composition and preferred conversion process, while the availability of the feedstock is important when considering the availability of the biomass source. Having a thorough understanding of the feedstock enables one to make a complete assessment of biomass energy production processes in terms of supply chain economics and optimum reactor designs. There are three key factors when considering biomass for bioenergy production:•Assessing the availability of biomass feedstocks,•Evaluating the economics and logistics of biomass collection, storage, and transportation, and•Researching and developing technologies for converting the biomass feedstock into value added products. The utilization of biomass as an energy source depends primarily on the availability of sustainable resources in a particular region. The composition of a feedstock is directly related to the climate and growing conditions in which that feedstock is produced. Therefore, classifying biomass by source and geographical origin distinguishes the important fuel characteristics, availability, and potential applications of each biomass feedstock based on geographic location.In this text, as in many other reports, we classify biomass feedstocks into two primary categories: (1) dedicated energy crops and (2) residues and wastes. Dedicated energy crops, which are grown primarily for energy utilization; or crop residues, which is the material other than the grain of the crop grown.}

The first phase accomplishes information acquisition and representation whereas the second phase imposes an optimization process on the collected datasets to generate an optimum state situation for a given industrial scenario. In the first phase, Morphological Analysis is used for breaking down complex industrial systems into manageable fragments. These provide the basis for knowledge and data acquisition and their representation. Each subset is represented in an individual table and defines one characteristic of the system like all kinds of resources, logistics, tax regulations, etc. In the second phase, the morphological table attributes are considered as variables which are subject to optimization. Values are assigned to all variables targeting a global optimum state. The solution reflects an optimized operation scenario for the relevant industrial organization. In the model, tables are linked by means of an objective function. The applied non-linear optimization process uses a hill-climbing algorithm. Due to certain constraints, all the volume demands at sales locations must be matched with the entire production capacities at production facilities. At the same time, either costs are minimized or profits are maximized. Additional constraints are imposed on the model to define feasible solution spaces. Both Morphological Analysis phase and the optimization processes employed have proved to be feasible and effective.}

The Resident Prep Curriculum (RPC), published in 2014 and developed as a collaboration of the American College of Surgeons, Association of Program Directors in Surgery, and the Association for Surgical Education, was designed to improve the quality and consistency of medical student preparation for surgical residency. We aim to assess the feasibility of and resource usage for implementation of this curriculum at our institution.
Design
Our institution expanded upon a pre-existing 2-week surgical preparatory course, adding modules designed to meet the goals and objectives of the RPC. We performed an evaluation of the resources required for these additions, namely time, logistics and incremental cost.
Setting
The course took place at the Perelman School of Medicine, which is a large, academic medical center affiliated with the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania.
Results
Our course satisfied each of the six domains outlined in the RPC. In 2015, 22 students were enrolled in the course. It was run over a consecutive 4-week period in the spring of 2015, with 9 full and 9 half days. To meet the needs of the Curriculum, approximately 33 hours (38%) were spent in the classroom, 34 hours (39%) in a simulation center, and 20 hours (23%) in the anatomical laboratory. Seventy faculty-hours (from 5 disciplines) and 73 resident-hours (double-counting for cotaught modules) were required to support the course. Besides room availability, funding was required for certain aspects of the course such as cadavers, dedicated anatomy teaching, and the costs of supplies in the simulation center. There is also a cost associated with the use of the Penn Medicine Simulation Center. Taking these into account, the total cost of implementing the curriculum amounted to $30,627.10.
Conclusion
The implementation of the RPC was feasible but relied heavily upon faculty/resident time. As a result of the success of this initiative, our medical school seeks to expand the idea across multiple specialties.}

Ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) allows normothermic evaluation and treatment of donor lungs not currently acceptable for transplant and improves organ use. Donor lungs undergo a period of cold preservation before (cold ischemic time [CIT]-1) and after (CIT-2) EVLP. We investigated the effect of an extended CIT-2 on lung function after transplantation.
Methods
Explanted pig lungs, preserved in low-potassium dextran flush (Perfadex) at 4°C for 10 hours, were subjected to 6 hours of EVLP. They were subsequently allocated to 2 groups: short CIT-2 (CIT-2 = 2 hours; n = 5), and long CIT-2 (CIT-2 = 10 hours; n = 5). In a control group (n = 6), explanted lungs were placed in cold static preservation for 24 hours without EVLP. After the total preservation period, the left lung was transplanted in all groups.
Results
After 4 hours of reperfusion, oxygenation function, acute lung injury score, inflammatory markers, and cell death pathway markers were similar between short and long CIT-2 groups. Both EVLP groups fared significantly better than the control group in oxygenation function (p < 0.05).
Conclusions
The intervention of EVLP improved lung function after transplantation, and this was not affected by a prolonged cold static preservation time after EVLP. These results provide the basis for a practical prolonged lung preservation strategy using a combination of cold and warm preservation techniques, which may improve lung transplantation logistics and outcomes.}

While Industrie 4.0 research generally considers most flexibility types, such as material handling flexibility, machine flexibility and operation flexibility, order allocation flexibility in particular is so far rarely investigated. Order allocation flexibility describes the flexibility potential that occurs when half-finished goods are not assigned to a specific customer order in a production system employing the make-to-order strategy, but instead can be freely assigned to any order that might require this half-finished good with its current specifications. Furthermore, this allocation from half-finished goods to orders might even change during the production process. Employing order allocation flexibility directly increases the degree of freedom for the other aforementioned flexibility types and has therefore already found application in the production of customer specific goods, e.g. in the form of a multi-phased order release in the automotive industry. In this context, cyber physical production systems with their capability of self-optimization and control theoretically offer the possibility to determine the allocation of half-finished goods to orders in near real time during any production step, leading to a further increase of flexibility in the overall production system. This work contributes to the state of the art in Industrie 4.0 research by first analyzing the potentials of a stronger consideration of order allocation flexibility into Industrie 4.0 enabled production systems and discussing the compatibility of existing research approaches with this flexibility type. Second, a conceptual model for production planning and control employing order allocation flexibility in a cyber-physical production system will be derived.}

Present capital cost of parabolic trough based CSP plant in India has been taken as US $2540/kW. Local manufacturing of CSP components and consequently reduced logistics is expected to reduce the capital cost by 14% and 8% respectively. A learning rate of 10% for the global cumulative diffusion in the base case scenario is expected to reduce capital cost to 49% of the present cost by the end of 2050. Present LCOE of US $151/MWh of CSP plant in India is expected to reduce to US $76/MWh by the end of 2050. Provision of 6hour thermal storage is expected to reduce LCOE of CSP plant in India by 18% as compared to LCOE of CSP plant without storage. Analysis for different learning rates (5%, 10% and 15%) for CSP plant and different discount rates (6%, 8% and 10%) has also been undertaken and results obtained are presented.}

The objective of this research is to quantify the sensitivity of steam production rate in a commercial updraft gasifier to several critical feedstock quality attributes like moisture, ash, and particles size. The specific case study is a 7 MW thermal gasifier at the University of British Columbia that supplies process steam to campus facilities. The wood fuel is collected from a large number of urban waste wood sources, sorted, and blended in a recycling yard (depot) prior to delivery to the gasification plant. Several improvements in particle size uniformity, reduction in wood contamination with dirt, and dryness of the feedstock were made within a two-year period of recorded data (2013–2014). As a result, the overall percent of operating hours of the gasification plant increased from 75% to 94% while the average steam production increased by 30%. Most of the earlier variability in fuel properties was traced to the blending of dry fuel chips at a moisture content of 17% wet basis with a high moisture green wood at a moisture content of 40% wet basis.}

abstract = {Global marine shipping annually accounts for about one billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent greenhouse gas emissions. Nuclear power propulsion may be an option to de-carbonise some niches of the merchant ocean fleet. This paper considers the three experimental nuclear-powered merchant ships launched and operated in the world so far; the iconic Savannah (USA), Otto Hahn (West Germany) and Mutsu (Japan). They were independently developed and operated in the 1960s and 1970s for technology demonstration and learning. A fourth ship, Sevmorput (Soviet Union/Russia, 1988–to date), is a pioneer in respect of its logistics functions and propulsion system. This paper develops a theoretical framework for the sustainability assessment of nuclear propulsion in ocean merchant shipping and presents a method for exploring nuclear propulsion, relative to flag state, ports, shipping resources and ocean transport services. The experimental ships’ transport efficiency is discussed and related to contemporary oil-fired shipping of general cargo, and to recent literature presenting possible future applications of merchant nuclear propulsion in some market niches. Insights provided include: (1) the experiments demonstrate that merchant nuclear propulsion may be technically feasible; (2) port and canal access for merchant nuclear-powered ships may be difficult and restricted; (3) the up-front costs, refuelling and end-of-life decommissioning costs of nuclear-powered ships are vast and uncertain against conventionally-powered ships; (4) because nuclear fuel is comparatively low-cost, the conventional oil-fired ship cost implications of high-speed operations do not apply.}

The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) accounts for savings of 720 kg CO2-eq per recycled refrigerator on average, thus demonstrating that an environmentally sound recycling process holds substantial emission reduction potential. In addition, the application of the recycling process in conjunction with collection and reverse logistics of refrigerators in a recycling system can reduce energy demand in Brazil by an average of 1.5 GJ per recycled unit. As a result, refrigerator recycling systems qualify as a valid and scalable energy efficiency measure in accordance with the Brazilian national framework for the evaluation of energy efficiency projects (PROPEE). The energy economics for projects based on recycling systems are shown for the 30 largest energy distributors in Brazil. Available budgets, calculated with diagnostics undertaken in conformity with the International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP) for a threshold value (cost-benefit ratio = 0.8), clearly indicate the viability and competitiveness of these recycling systems as project opportunities for energy conservation under the national energy regulation agency ANEEL's energy efficiency program (PEE).}

This study aimed to examine primary care physicians' knowledge, attitudes, referral practices, and associated barriers regarding LDCT screening. We administered a national survey of primary care physicians in the United States between September 2016 and April 2017. Physicians received up to 3 mailings, 1 follow-up email, and received varying incentives to complete the survey. Overall, 293 physicians participated, for a response rate of 13%. We used weighted descriptive statistics to characterize participants and their responses. Over half of the respondents correctly reported that the US Preventive Services Task Force recommends LDCT screening for high-risk patients. Screening recommendations for patients not meeting high-risk criteria varied. Although 75% agreed that the benefits of LDCT screening outweigh the risks, fewer agreed that there is substantial evidence that screening reduces mortality (50%). The most commonly reported barriers to ordering screening included prior authorization requirements (57%), lack of insurance coverage (53%), and coverage denials (31%). The most frequently cited barrier to conducting LDCT screening shared decision making was patients' competing health priorities (42%). Given the impact of physician recommendations on cancer screening utilization, further understanding of physicians' LDCT screening attitudes and shared decision-making practices is needed. Clinical practice and policy changes are also needed to engage more patients in screening discussions.}

Previous work focuses either on a single technology with fixed site-selection criteria, or on small, localised areas. The potential for combining or co-locating different offshore energy technologies, particularly over a large region, has been explored previously but at a relatively low level of detail. Here, bespoke resource data from high resolution co-located, co-temporal wind and wave models are presented in a GIS with a range of additional environmental and physical parameters. Dedicated decision-support tools have been developed to facilitate flexible, multi-criteria site selections specifically for combined wind-wave energy platforms, focusing on the energy resources available. Time-series tools highlight some of the more detailed factors impacting on a site-selection decision. The results show that the main potential for combined technologies in Europe is focused to the north and west due to strong resources and acceptable depth conditions, but that there are still obstacles to be overcome in terms of constructability and accessibility. The most extreme conditions generally coincide with the maximum energy output, and access to these sites is more limited.}

In recent years there has been a small but sustained stream of discrete-event simulation case studies in modelling hyperacute stroke systems. The nature of such case studies has led to a fragmented knowledge base and high entry cost to stroke modelling research. Two common issues have faced researchers in stroke care: understanding the logistics and clinical aspects of stroke care and moving from these findings to an appropriately detailed model. We aim to accelerate studies in this area by introducing a conceptual modelling framework that is domain specific for stroke. A domain specific framework trades-off the wide applicability of a general framework against increased efficiency and reuse to support modelling in the problem domain. This compromise is appropriate when the problem domain is complex, of high value to society, and where the saving in future modelling effort is likely to be greater than the effort to create the framework. We detail the requirements of a domain specific conceptual model and then provide domain specific knowledge to support modellers in gaining an understanding of the problem situation, translating this knowledge into selected model outputs, inputs and content in the case of hyperacute stroke. We illustrate the use of the framework with an example based at a large hospital in the United Kingdom.}

These uncommon spare parts occupy valuable space in smaller inventories and take a long time to be transported to the point of need, thus delaying the repair process. This paper proposes that storing the spare parts on a server and producing them with additive manufacturing (AM) on demand can shorten the repair cycle by simplifying the logistics. Introducing AM in the repair supply chain lowers the number of products that need to be reimbursed to the customer due to lengthy repairs, improves the repair statistics of the repair shops, and reduces the number of items that are held in stock. For this paper, the functionality of the concept was verified by reverse engineering a memory cover of a portable computer and laser sintering it from polyamide 12. The additively manufactured component fit well and the computer operated normally after the replacement. The current spare part supply chain model and models with AM machinery located at the repair shop, the centralized spare part provider, and the original equipment manufacturer were provided. The durations of the repair process in the models were compared by simulating two scenarios with the Monte Carlo method. As the biggest improvement, the model with the AM machine in the repair shop reduced the duration of the repair process from 14 days to three days. The result points to the conclusion that placing the machine as close to the need as possible is the best option, if there is enough demand. The spare parts currently compatible with AM are plastic components without strict surface roughness requirements, but more spare parts will become compatible with the development of AM.}

Background
Hand hygiene is a major means for preventing healthcare-associated infections. One critical point in understanding poor compliance is the lack of relevant markers used to monitor practices systematically.
Methods
This study analysed hand hygiene compliance and associated factors with a radio-frequency-identification-based real-time continuous automated monitoring system in an infectious disease ward with 17 single bedrooms. Healthcare workers (HCWs) were tracked while performing routine care over 171 days. A multi-level multi-variate logistics model was used for data analysis. The main outcome measures were hand disinfection before entering the bedroom (outside use) and before entering the patient care zone, defined as the zone surrounding the patient’s bed (inside/bedside use). Variables analysed included HCWs’ characteristics and behaviour, patients, room layouts, path chains and duration of HCWs’ paths.
Findings
In total, 4629 paths with initial hand hygiene opportunities when entering the patient care zone were selected, of which 763 (16.5%), 285 (6.1%) and 3581 (77.4%) were associated with outside use, inside/bedside use and no use, respectively. Hand hygiene is caregiver-dependent. The shorter the duration of the HCW’s path, the worse the bedside hand hygiene. Bedside hand hygiene is improved when one or two extra HCWs are present in the room.
Interpretation
Hand hygiene compliance at the bedside, as analysed using the continuous monitoring system, depended upon the HCW’s occupation and personal behaviour, number of HCWs, time spent in the room and (potentially) dispenser location. Meal tray distribution was a possible factor in the case of failure to disinfect hands.}

Despite the necessity of the integral recycling of gypsum products, only a part of the waste plaster is reused, which leads to the development of products with large quantities of plaster to meet this growing demand. The objective of this research was to investigate the variation of the physical and mechanical properties of residues of gypsum plasterboard sheets and commercial gypsum during recycling cycles on bench scale. The experiment addressed the crushing, milling, calcination, hydration, formation and breaking of test bodies. The microstructure of the recycled gypsum was characterized according to its chemical and mineralogical composition by using scanning electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The characteristics of the powder and the physical and mechanical properties in the fresh and hardened states were determined for five proportions of recycled gypsum and commercial gypsum throughout the recycling cycles. The results showed that it is possible to obtain 8.40 MPa for axial compression strength at 28 days in the first three recycling cycles for gypsum from gypsum boards, recycled gypsum plaster and the suggested mixtures, except for gypsum recycled in the first cycle and commercial gypsum plaster. Values higher than 30 N mm−2 were obtained for surface hardness in all samples. The reversibility of the reactions was verified during the recycling cycles, proving the technical viability of the process up to the third recycling cycle. The third cycle gypsum presented similar results to the original gypsum and met the technical norms requirements. Hence, the potential of producing components containing large quantities of recycled gypsum is notable, thus encouraging not only reverse logistics but also the incorporation of waste products and increasing products cycles.}

This study considers two-echelon vehicle routing problem with simultaneous pickup and delivery (2E-VRPSPD) which is a variant of vehicle routing problem. In the 2E-VRPSPD, the pickup and delivery activities are performed simultaneously by the same vehicles through depot to satellites in the first echelon and from satellites to customers in the second echelon. To solve the problem, firstly, a node-based mathematical model is proposed and three valid inequalities from the literature are adapted to strengthen the model. Because of the NP-hardness of the 2E-VRPSPD, secondly, a hybrid heuristic algorithm based on variable neighborhood descent (VND) and local search (LS), called VND_LS, is developed to solve medium- and large-size instances of the 2E-VRPSPD. We conduct an experimental study to investigate the effectiveness of the valid inequalities on the mathematical model and also to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the VND_LS. Computational results show that valid inequalities have significant effect to strengthen the mathematical formulation. Furthermore, the VND_LS finds good solutions for the problem efficiently. Finally, we apply the VND_LS to compare single- and two-echelon distribution systems for a supermarket chain located in Turkey. The results indicate that the VND_LS can easily be applied for real-world problems.}

Nowadays, according to the new layout requirements, the facility layout problems (FLPs) have many applications such as hospital layout, construction site layout planning and layout of logistics facilities. Therefore, we study an extended MRFLP, as a novel layout problem, with the following main assumptions: 1) the facilities are arranged in a two-dimensional area and without splitter rows, 2) multiple products are available, 3) distance between each pair of facilities, due to inaccurate and flexible manufacturing processes and other limitations (such as WIPs, industrial instruments, transportation lines and etc.), is considered as fuzzy number, and 4) the objective function is considered as minimizing the material handling and lost opportunity costs. To model these assumptions, a nonlinear mixed-integer programming model with fuzzy constraints is presented and then converted to a linear mixed-integer programming model. Since the developed model is an NP-hard problem, a genetic algorithm approach is suggested to find the best solutions with a minimum cost function. Additionally, three different crossover methods are compared in the proposed genetic algorithm and finally, a sensitivity analysis is performed to discuss important parameters.}

In particular, the results suggested that: (1) lean practices such as JIT, set-up time reduction, cellular manufacturing, and waste elimination can significantly contribute to improve GSC performance; (2) green practices including eco-design, life cycle assessment, green manufacturing, reverse logistics, and waste management significantly and positively affect GSC performance; (3) process innovation practices such as fast response to new processes introduced by other companies within the same sector, pioneering disposition to introduced new processes, and number of changes in the process introduced in one year, do not have a direct contribution to improving GSC performance; finally that (4) process innovation amplifies the effect which contributes for lean and green practices to offer a higher payoff rate in terms of GSC performance when these are coupled with process innovation activities. This paper presents an innovative approach since it studies simultaneously the three dimensions of sustainability (environmental, social and economic), the lean, the innovation process and green paradigms, which are considered strategic for supply chain competitiveness.

Implementation of trauma systems has markedly assisted in improving outcomes of the injured patient. However, differences exist internationally as diverse social factors, economic conditions and national particularities are placing obstacles. The purpose of this paper is to critically evaluate the current Greek trauma system, provide a comprehensive review and suggest key actions.
Methods
An exhaustive search of the – scarce on this subject – English and Greek literature was carried out to analyze all the main components of the Greek trauma system, according to American College of Surgeons’ criteria, as well as the WHO Trauma Systems Maturity Index.
Results
Regarding prevention, efforts are in the right direction lowering the road traffic incidents-related death rate, however rural and insular regions remain behind. Hellenic Emergency Medical Service (EKAB) has well-defined communications and emergency phone line but faces problems with educating people on how to use it properly. In addition, equal and systematic training of ambulance personnel is a challenge, with the lack of pre-hospital registry and EMS quality assessment posing a question on where the related services are currently standing. Redistribution of facilities’ roles with the establishment of the first formal trauma centre in the existing infrastructure would facilitate the development of a national registry and introduction of the trauma surgeon subspecialty with proper training potential. Definite rehabilitation institutional protocols that include both inpatient and outpatient care are needed. Disaster preparedness entails an extensive national plan and regular drills, mainly at the pre-hospital level. The lack, however, of any accompanying quality assurance programs hampers the effort to yield the desirable results.
Conclusion
Despite recent economic crisis in Greece, actions solving logistics and organising issues may offer a well-defined, integrated trauma system without uncontrollably raising the costs. Political will is needed for reforms that use pre-existing infrastructure and working power in a more efficient way, with a first line priority being the establishment of the first major trauma centre that could function as the cornerstone for the building of the Greek trauma system.}

The objective of this study is to compare the performance impact of different recovery policies on return flows subject to the simultaneously optimized re-configuration plans for material flows. We formulate a multi-objective problem with return flow reduction function for a multi-period, multi-stage, multi-product SC. We consider a recovery problem with ripple effect, performance impact assessment and re-planning decisions. The developed multi-objective hybrid linear programming-system dynamics model allows simultaneously re-computing the material flows in a multi-stage SC after a disruption and comparing the performance impact of different recovery policies subject to return flows, gradual capacity recovery, variable recovery costs and time. The results suggest that the consideration of gradual capacity recovery leads to minimization of disruption-related return flows in both upstream and downstream SC parts. Fast and expensive recovery strategy provides the lowest return costs in the upstream SC part as compared to normal and slow recovery policies. Similar, the profits and service levels are increased. In the fast and expensive recovery policy, the performance in the upstream and downstream does not change with the introduction of the gradual recovery considerations. The effects of gradual capacity recovery introduction become evident if smaller time sub-periods are considered within the recovery period.}

As such, classical inventory models wherein the sole measure of performance is cost minimization are no longer appropriate to handle such emerging and pressing issue. This paper assesses the impact of accounting for carbon emissions, resulting from transportation and storage activities of a cold item, in the context of a multi stage supply chain comprised of a plant/warehouse, a distribution center (DC) and a retailer. We present an operational cost minimization model, a carbon footprint minimization model and a hybrid economic and environmental minimization model where all models seek to determine the optimal lot sizing and shipping quantities, alongside the number of trucks to be used in the upstream and downstream directions of the supply chain as well as the number of freezer units utilized at the DC which is owned by a third party logistics provider. The structural properties for the optimal solution of the three models are identified and solution algorithms are also proposed. Upon conducting computational experiments, it turns out that the incorporation of carbon related costs, through carbon tax regulation, may call for adjusting the adopted operational policy which results in a minor increase in the operational cost. However, this increase is outweighed by the savings resulting from the carbon related costs. Numerical results of the sensitivity analysis on the carbon tax policy indicate that as the tax rate increases, substantial reductions in the amount of carbon footprint emitted are realized and cost savings are also achieved when adopting the lot sizing and shipping policy of the third/integrated model over the operational cost minimization model.}

These foundations are subjected to a combination of axial loads, low-amplitude cyclic lateral loads, bending and torsional moments generated by the offshore wind turbine (OWT) structure and various environmental factors. Monopiles are the most widely adopted foundation choice for OWT structures worldwide, in terms of ease of installation, economy and logistics. For monopiles, the applied loads and moments must be resisted by earth pressures mobilized in the surrounding soil, with an adequate factor of safety provided. Compared with the axial loading case, the cyclic lateral loads are considered governing for serviceability requirements. This chapter presents details on the environmental loading, geometric dimensions and geotechnical design considerations for OWT foundations, with a focus on monopile fondations. Existing methods for modelling soil under cyclic loading are reviewed, with emphasis on strain accumulation models that take into consideration the monopile–soil interaction. Inherent limitations and shortcomings of these models for the analysis/design of OWT monopile foundations are discussed, along with recommendations for future research needs.}

abstract = {Mexico is the 7th largest producer of beef in the world. The livestock transport is a vital component of today’s world agrifood economy that directly impacts on the development of animal production, animal welfare, public policies, labor regulations, food safety, markets and consumers. In this study two aims were established; the first aim was to identify the attitudes and perceptions of commercial hauliers towards animal welfare and their influence on the accident risks. The second aim was to characterize the current practices of the commercial cattle transport in Mexico and to detect the risk factors for animal welfare and hauliers’ wellbeing. The interviews were conducted individually at the hauliers’ rest points, sanitary inspection points localized along the Federal Highway 57 or at the companies’ offices of cattle transportation. We used univariate, bivariate and multivariate statistics based on a hierarchical cluster analysis. The results showed that cattle transport in Mexico is characterized for long travel distances because the cattle departed from farms in the southern states of Mexico to the feedlots located in central and northern regions of the country. The journeys of short and middle distances departed from the feedlots to the slaughterhouses. The hauliers’ characteristics were: age from 29 to 48 years-old, elementary or secondary studies completed, 65% of hauliers mentioned six years of experience in cattle transport, they learned about cattle transportation by means of a family member who was already engaged in this activity. The cluster analysis identified four hauliers’ groups: groups 1 and 3 were related to animal welfare and groups 2 and 4 less related to animal welfare. This study showed that empathy towards cattle was a key element in identifying hauliers at risk of road accidents during cattle transportation. Years of experience in cattle transport played an important role in emphasizing closer perceptions towards welfare. Considering current trends towards increased transport times and logistics stops, there is a need to develop systems of welfare assessment and decision-making that provide tools and protocols that can minimize the biological cost to animals and hauliers, which may have been underestimated in the past.}

An interdisciplinary approach of various fields such as microbiology, molecular biology, chemistry, genetics, chemical engineering and agriculture in addition to cross-sectional technologies such as economy, logistics and digitalization is necessary to meet the future global challenges. The genomic era has contributed significantly to the exploitation of naturés biodiversity also from extreme habitats. By applying modern technologies it is now feasible to deliver robust enzymes (extremozymes) and robust microbial systems that are active at temperatures up to 120°C, at pH 0 and 12 and at 1000bar. In the post-genomic era, different sophisticated “omics” analyses will allow the identification of countless novel enzymes regardless of the lack of cultivability of most microorganisms. Furthermore, elaborate protein-engineering methods are clearing the way towards tailor-made robust biocatalysts. Applying environmentally friendly and efficient biological processes, terrestrial and marine biomass can be converted to high value products e.g. chemicals, building blocks, biomaterials, pharmaceuticals, food, feed and biofuels. Thus, further application of extremophiles has the potential to improve sustainability of existing biotechnological processes towards a greener biobased industry.}

The framework begins with a simulation of the biodiesel production system, feeding later, with suitable input parameters and suitable solutions, and a macro-location model designed to establish the regional positioning of biofuel conversion plants. Optimal regions are used as initial feasible solution space for the proposed micro-location model. In this part of the framework, we introduce an adaptation of Extended Goal Programming to rank the best municipalities (definitive locations) emphasizing the social aspects under consideration. The framework application is set up in the following Colombian context: first generation biodiesel production from palm oil feedstock. Our computational results indicate that the Colombian city of Rionegro (in the Santader region) is the most sustainable location for a new biodiesel plant.}

This paper takes into account a range of alternative transport modes, routes and methods with particular reference to UK wine imports from two regions: northern Italy and Southeast Australia. The research examines supply chain structures, costs and the environmental impact of international wine distribution to the UK. A number of options are evaluated to calculate the carbon footprint and sulphate emissions of alternative route, mode, method of carriage, and packaging combinations. The estimation of CO2e emissions incorporates three main elements - cargo mass, distance and method of carriage; sulphate emissions are derived from actual ship routes, engine power and operational speeds. The bottling of wine either at source or close to destination is also taken into consideration. The key findings are: there are major differences between the environmental footprint of different routeing and packaging scenarios; the international shipping leg almost always has a much larger footprint than inland transport within the UK except in the hypothetical case of the rail shipments from Italy using flexitanks. With reference to sulphate, the lowest cost scenario among the sea maximizing options is also the sulphate minimising solution.}

Therefore reliability, availability, and maintainability (RAM) analysis is the basis of complex system performance analysis. To demonstrate such methodology the RAM analysis steps, such as scope definition, lifetime data analysis, modeling, simulation, critical analysis, sensitivity analysis, and conclusions, will be discussed. In fact, RAM analysis simulates the system behavior in terms of subsystem and equipment failures along the life cycle, To perform such simulation the reliability diagram block model is very necessary, as will be demonstrated. In addition, the main object of study in RAM analysis rather than predicting the performance index is to analyze the influence of external factors on system performance, such as logistics, spare parts, redundancy configuration, as well as the effect of preventive maintenance in performance indexes. Each of such factors influence in asset performance will be demonstrated by example in this chapter. Moreover, to predict the necessary performance improvement the improvement allocation and optimization concepts will be discussed. The chapter will present different case studies applied to real asset project and operation phase solutions to improve different system performances.}

Various international organisations and institutions impose environmental standards on their member states to limit the emission of greenhouse gases. This paper examines both the potential effects of the emerging international maritime emission regulations on the competition between seaports and the potential underlying economic motivations fostering the discussion of introducing Emission Control Areas. It focuses on deepsea shipping. Another novelty is that the environmental issues are addressed from a policy, an economic and a legislative viewpoint. For the policy-related part, it is found that the political theory of public choice suggests that not the green lobby but rather the petrochemical lobby is the major driving factor behind the very strict emission caps. A potential port shift from Northern Europe to Mediterranean ports seems unlikely due to logistics disadvantages and service problems in Southern European ports. Finally, no convincing proof was found that the main liner companies would be unprepared for this legislation and should be persuaded to change their routes in favour of Mediterranean ports solely on account of the various emission regulations. The legal analysis, however, showed that the current enforcement regime of MARPOL Annex VI should be improved in order to rule out the possibility of a low degree of compliance and to protect the competiveness of complying ships.}

The objectives are to estimate starch content of fresh cassava roots and to identify significant factors that affect starch content in cassava roots. Three prediction models, including multiple regression, artificial neural network (ANN), and hybrid deep belief network (HDBN), are implemented. Input data were collected from 242 farmers from 49 different sub-districts in Nakhon Ratchasima province in the Northeast of Thailand, who supply fresh cassava roots to the manufacturing plant. Potential factors are classified into four categories: farmers’ demographics, cultivation activities, harvesting activities, and logistics activities, a total of 38 variables. Regression models, ANNs with one hidden layer, and HDBNs were constructed for starch content prediction. Prediction performances were evaluated using the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage errors (MAPE), which were 2.44 percent of starch content and 7.283% for the best regression model; 2.41 and 7.055% for the best ANN, and 2.35 and 6.226% for the best HDBN, respectively. The results indicate that HDBN outperforms the other two models in terms of prediction performance. The final regression model and the best ANN are primarily used to identify seven important factors that can potentially describe starch content. These include harvest age, planting density, growing season, farm location, type of soil, cassava variety, and weed control method.}

In many coopetition networks, most of the cooperation has been in input activities, essentially meaning that little research is conducted in coopetition business networks with cooperative activities close to the customer. This article closes the gap by investigating coopetition in an ICT business network comprising small-to-medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the B2B sector. The purpose of this paper is to increase understanding of cooperation between competing firms by analyzing the success factors of cooperative activities close to the customer that lead to a positive outcome of coopetition. The results of the study show that some case companies are more competition oriented, whereas the others are more cooperation oriented. At the activity level of analysis, cooperation occurs in branding, marketing, joint customers, and delivery of services; whereas companies compete in local services, marketing campaigns, and pricing. In addition, our study shows that certain success factors for coopetition are highlighted, particularly in output activities such as activeness, geographical distance and personal resources.}

Gasification is an attractive thermochemical conversion technology due to its flexibility in the product gas end-uses. Therefore, it is valuable to investigate whether additional benefits are foreseen when torrefaction is coupled with gasification. Therefore, two commercial torrefied wood fuels and their parent materials are gasified at 800–850 °C under atmospheric steam-oxygen circulating fluidized bed gasification conditions and magnesite as bed material. The torrefied feedstocks consisted of wood residues torrefied by Topell at 250 °C (Topell black), and mixed wood and wood residues torrefied by Torrcoal at 300 °C (Torrcoal black). The gasification results show that torrefaction resulted in an increased gas quality, as it yielded higher H2 and CO contents, a decrease of the CO2 content, increased gas yield and a significant decrease of the total tar content for both feedstocks. For the Torrcoal samples, torrefaction resulted in a decrease in the carbon conversion efficiency (CCE). In addition, the cold gas efficiency (CGE) remained approximately the same due to the increase in the H2 and CO contents. The Topell samples showed an increase in the CCE and CGE upon torrefaction, but this could be attributed to a significant grinding in the screw feeder. It is generally concluded that both torrefied fuels may offer benefits as a feedstock for steam-oxygen blown circulating fluidized bed gasification, in particular in terms of gas quality and yield.}

Recently, both stationary and wearable systems are utilized for long-term monitoring of Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals in fog computing based medical applications. However, the comfort of monitored patients is not at a satisfactory level and therefore, a well-designed textile electrode with excellent signal quality and comfortability (SQC) plays a significant role in collecting ECG signals. In this study, in order to provide SQC optimization, a textile electrode with knitted structure and conductive material comprising cotton /nylon fiber coated silver is investigated. This textile composite is integrated to a wearable carrier (T-Shirt) with a miniaturized wireless sensing platform to collect ECG signals from the human. As a design strategy to acquire dimensional stability, the fabric was knitted with two layers that form the same technical face on both fabric surfaces. The conducted experiment elaborate that to find out a balance between the quality of signal and wearable comfort level by finely adjusting the composition of fiber type, yarn density, fabric pattern, fabric density, and thickness. From our experimental results, it is observed that textile electrodes having cotton (30) /nylon fiber coated silver (70) provides less air resistance (0.17 KPa•s/m), optimized tactile comfort (9/10), reasonable signal to noise ratio (SNR) value of 30.78dB, and better thermal conductivity (0.018W/m•K) than compared electrodes. Thus, it can be concluded that developed textile electrode can be useful for future research to offer the balance for SQC ratio for ECG measurement in fog computing based healthcare systems.}

Retailers generally provide lenient return policies not only because they may signal high quality but also because they act as risk relievers for consumers’ purchasing decision processes. However, increasing product returns have become particularly challenging for the efficient management of inventory. As such, at the crux of a holistic inventory model lies the understanding of consumer return behavior. In this study, we introduce a variant of the classical single-period inventory (newsvendor) model with returns, in which heterogeneous consumers decide, based on their post-purchase valuation of the product, whether to return the product after using it. From the perspective of the retailer, such deliberate returns may abuse the return policy, which in turn may exacerbate reverse logistics and environmental costs. To that end, we incorporate demand uncertainty and consumer valuation uncertainty by explicitly gauging return probabilities and differentiated salvage values into a newsvendor model. We derive analytical results for the profit-maximizing order quantity for a single-period product that comes with a retailer return policy and exclusively identify the impact of return type as abused or normal. Also offered are closed-form optimal solutions in the cases where market demand is exponentially or uniformly distributed. Structural and numerical results lend managerial insight into how optimal ordering amount, profit, return rates and salvage values change with the price, return window, and hassle cost of returning the product.}

The present study tries to investigate the supply chain network and related problems of the biodiesel industry in North East India. The Jatropha based biodiesel supply chain includes stages like feedstock production, feedstock logistics (collection, storage, and transportation), biodiesel production, biodiesel distribution, and biodiesel end-use. The major challenge in feedstock production stage is to achieve a seed production level sufficient for ensuring a stable supply of biodiesel. Poor seed processing infrastructure is another bottleneck in the Jatropha value chain in NE India. Establishing market for Jatropha by-products is also crucial for sustainability of the industry. Collective efforts from public and private sectors are needed along with increase in the market price of biodiesel, which will motivate the farmers and infuse confidence to continue with Jatropha.}

Question prompt lists (QPLs) and consultation audio-recordings (CARs) are two communication strategies that can assist cancer patients in understanding and recalling information. We aimed to explore clinician and organisational barriers and facilitators to implementing QPLs and CARs into usual care.
Methods
Semi-structured interviews with twenty clinicians and senior hospital administrators, recruited from four hospitals. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and thematic descriptive analysis was utilised.
Results
CARs and QPLs are to some degree already being initiated by patients but not embedded in usual care. Systematic use should be driven by patient preference. Successful implementation will depend on minimal burden to clinical environments and feedback about patient use. CARs concerns included: medico-legal issues, ability of the CAR to be shared beyond the consultation, and recording and storage logistics within existing medical record systems. QPLs issues included: applicability of the QPLs, ensuring patients who might benefit from QPL’s are able to access them, and limited use when there are other existing communication strategies.
Conclusions
While CARs and QPLs are beneficial for patients, there are important individual, system and medico-legal considerations regarding usual care.
Practice implications
Identifying and addressing practical implications of CARs and QPLs prior to clinical implementation is essential.}

Lack of visibility for drivers over their direct environments is one of the main causes of such accidents, which are often serious. Visibility can be improved indirectly by using camera-and-screen systems. This article gives the findings of a study on the detectability of a pedestrian by a driver using such a system in various configurations. It is thus recommended that, under the most unfavourable conditions, any pedestrian entering the danger zone be shown on the screen with at least a minimum height of 10 mm. Since the risk of non-detection is higher at the edges of the screen than at the centre, it is also recommended that the detection zone of the system cover an area extending beyond the danger zone under surveillance. Finally, since the size of the screen does not have a significant influence on detection, the choice of the screen size should be governed more by criteria regarding the fitting out of and the ergonomics of the cab or of the driving position.
Relevance to industry
Preventing mobile plant-pedestrian collisions is a problem area that concerns many enterprises, in particular in activity sectors like building and civil engineering, handling, transport/logistics and waste collection. Using camera-and-screen systems allows improving the visibility of the driver. This study gives recommendations about choice of such systems, in order to ensure better detection of pedestrians.}

This critical problem is encountered in many supply chains. Collaborative solutions, such as the Collaborative Planning, Forecasting and Replenishment (CPRF) model, are not fully automatized and remain poorly suited for enhancing the relation between manufacturers and transport operators. Furthermore, centralized planning is not suitable in keeping confidential the objectives of each partner of the same supply chain. Therefore, this work aims to develop a decentralized planning approach based on a negotiation protocol. Our approach tries to reach a “win–win” planning solution and to give some decisional flexibility to transport operators. This protocol is founded on an incentive mechanism that can be used by transport operators to progressively persuade manufacturers to accept a pickup plan. This study is focused on the case of one manufacturer and one transport operator. The key determinants of the coordination protocol and a set of planning models based on linear programming are presented here, followed by the design of the experiments used to identify the factors affecting the overall performance of each partner. The results demonstrate that it is possible to obtain plans that satisfy the manufacturer (i.e., the client of the transport operator) while increasing profit for the transport operator. This is in favor of the application of these principles to the coordination of multiple transport operators.}

abstract = {With the competitive seeds market and development needs of seed companies, the production of crop seeds, including raw seeds procurement, processing, storage, packaging, and logistics, is complicated. Seeds packaging is one of the most important phases, including automatic and manual packaging. Automatic packaging is highly efficient with high setup costs, whereas manual packaging is the opposite. It is difficult for the managers to make the packaging planning, i.e., the number of automatic and manual packaging, based on the forecasted demand. This problem is considered to be a special dynamic lot-sizing problem but it is more complex compared to the general ones. To deal with this problem, this paper proposes a mathematical programming model with the objective of minimizing the total costs. Because the problem is Non-Deterministic Polynomial (NP) hard, the computational time for solving this model is very long. Therefore, this paper proposes a heuristic algorithm (HA) to solve the problem. Numerical results showed that the total costs calculated by the proposed HA are close enough (8.12%) to the optimal total costs of the proposed model and 22.6% lower than the traditional planning. At different scenarios, the HA can keep beneficial and reliable to a certain extent. The proposed model and HA provided detailed illustration for understanding the complexity of the seeds packaging planning and were able to deal with real situations in the seed company.}

As many warehouses outsource order delivery to a Third Party Logistics (3PL) provider in B2C e-commerce, small lot-size orders arriving dynamically within a certain time period should be grouped into batches and packed up before a fixed departure time. Research on on-line order batching problems, however, seldom takes delivery constraints into consideration. This paper studies the integrated on-line order batching and distribution scheduling problem in which the maximal number of orders has to be completed before the vehicles’ departure time in the shortest service time. Several novel rule-based solutions are proposed, including the formation of batches, which are assigned to appropriate pickers without any information on the arrival times of future orders. Moreover, the solutions define which orders are urgent and should be picked up directly, and which ones can be satisfied later. The solution algorithms are evaluated through a series of experiments. It is demonstrated that these algorithms can lead to a substantial increase of the number of delivered orders, which reveals the importance of integrating order batching with delivery.}

The study explored how satisfaction levels with transition may improve during their first year, using a unique approach of a continuous quality assurance feedback loop. This assurance framework is utilised in hospitality, automotive and supply chain logistics and in health, primarily to monitor patient outcomes. However, an association with graduate nurse satisfaction has not been previously reported. Graduate nurses from two health services completed a short survey questionnaire every four weeks for 12 months. De-identified aggregated data was sent to health service management, giving them an opportunity to integrate the findings with the objective of potentially increasing graduate satisfaction ratings. Quantitative findings showed no statistical significance of graduate nurse satisfaction scores between health services, however, one health service consistently outperformed the other. Qualitative findings drawn from a seminar and interviews confirmed that one health service took a more proactive stance with the monthly reports, communicating the results to ward managers. Outcomes reflected a greater commitment of support and an overall increase of satisfaction scores.}

This study examines the influences of highway proximity and traffic on office values in Hong Kong using hedonic price analysis on 13,670 transactions around highway interchanges for 2002–2013. Our hedonic regressions, controlling for unobservable district effects and incorporating instrumental variables, reveal that the associations of highway proximity and traffic with office prices appear to exhibit mixed results across Hong Kong's three territorial divisions. The negative externalities generated by excess traffic cancel out the accessibility benefits of highway proximity on Hong Kong Island, where densely built-up office districts are suited for amenity-sensitive knowledge businesses that tend to create value-added services through face-to-face communications. By contrast, highway proximity uplifts the value of office properties with lower transportation costs and higher market accessibility in Kowloon and the New Territories, where spacious workplaces near hub-port and logistics facilities are advantageous for mobility-driven trade and transportation businesses that tend to increase value-added throughput in cross-border relations with mainland China. These territorial findings are of particular importance for progressive policymakers to deploy the strategic applications of underground bypasses, greenway creation, interchange improvement, congestion charges, and smart technology to manage mobility and alleviate disamenity, accompanied by supportive public transit services and adaptive land-use rezoning, in the dynamic and complex process of deindustrialization.}

For example, material handling is a vital element of industrial processes, which involves a variety of operations including the movement, storage and control of materials throughout the processes of manufacturing, distribution, and disposal while having to satisfy multiple objectives. Having an efficient and effective material handling system (MHS) is of great importance to various industries, such as manufacturing and logistics industries, for maintaining and facilitating a continuous flow of materials through the workplace and guaranteeing that required materials are available when needed. In this paper, a hybrid multi-objective optimization algorithm largely based on Artificial Immune Systems (AIS) is applied to simulation-based optimization of material handling system. This proposed algorithm hybridizes the AIS with the Genetic Algorithm (GA) by incorporating the crossover operator derived from the biological evolution. The reason behind such hybridization is to further enhance the diversity of the clone population and the convergence of the algorithm. In this paper, other than conducting numerical experiments to assess the performance of the proposed algorithm by using several benchmark problems, the proposed algorithm is also applied to optimize a multi-objective simulation-based problem on a material handling system in order to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed algorithm in real-life cases. The results show that for most cases the proposed algorithm outperforms the other benchmark algorithms especially in terms of solution diversity.}

Oil spill response operations in this region can be hampered by a lack of existing infrastructure, limited pre-positioned response equipment, and the possibility that response equipment might not arrive in time to mitigate the impact of a spill because of distance and infrastructure limitations. These considerations are modeled by two inter-related constraint sets with the objective of minimized total weighted response time for a set of potential oil spill incidents. One constraint set determines how to dynamically allocate response equipment and improve the infrastructures necessary to stockpile them within a network of response sites. The other set determines how to utilize this stockpile to respond to each task necessary for an incident by scheduling the equipment to complete tasks. These task completion times are subject to deadlines which, if not met, can, instead, require costlier follow-on tasks to be scheduled. The model, its assumptions, and data requirements were assessed by subject matter experts in the United States (U.S.) Coast Guard and a major Oil Spill Response Organization in the context of oil spill response logistics to support energy exploration initiatives in the U.S. Arctic.}

Emerging technologies affect every industry and management of supply chain and logistics are no exception. Given that Digital Supply Chain (DSC) provides several opportunities to companies the topic has received increasing attention from both academia and industry in the recent years. Today, an emerging worldwide trend in supply chain management is a shift of the focus from classical supply chains towards DSC, which leverages new solutions to generate new sources of revenue and additional business value for organizations. Recognizing these potential benefits, today’s modern organizations now interact with their dealers through DSC processes for improved efficiency and effectiveness in their production and delivery operations. Supplier selection is one of the crucial processes that has been affected by the digitalization of supply chain management. Addressing multi-criteria nature of the supplier selection process, this article introduces a new DSC approach for the first time to support the supplier selection process. This approach develops a group decision making (GDM) method in an uncertain environment. This methodology also considers decision makers when they are under pressure and/or lack expertise during the evaluation process. The proposed framework integrates for the first time the Interval Valued Intuitionistic Fuzzy (IVIF) Sets, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Additive Ratio Assessment (ARAS) under a GDM environment. IVIF AHP is used to evaluate criteria weights and IVIF ARAS methodology is used for the alternative assessment procedure. The paper also included the analyses for the selection of a suitable supplier in a real case study from Turkey to illustrate the validity of the proposed novel approach.}

While some empirical studies have provided support for the positive effects of information integration, very few have suggested that firms may be “worse off” as a result of it. In line with the latter view, this study considers that information integration could have either positive or negative impacts depending on the congruence or lack thereof of the objectives between the entities involved in information integration. To investigate this view, this study examines the effect of different types of information integrations on firm performance under supply and demand uncertainty. We consider a supply chain composed of two stages where a supplier provides a retailer with a single product under a periodic review multi-period framework. Internal Information Integration is reflected in joint dynamic pricing and ordering strategies by the retailer’s logistics and marketing units, with the objective of maximizing the expected profit under a customer service level target. External Information Integration is reflected in the supplier sharing his supply variation with the retailer, and in the retailer sharing his customer level target with the supplier. The study’s findings show that Full integration (i.e., centralized decision making) results in optimal firm profitability, inventory policy and customer service level when both the supplier and the retailer have shared objectives. In contrast, when the supplier and the retailer focus on maximizing their own performance, an “Arm’s length relationship”-i.e., No integration-becomes a better alternative than Full integration, thus indicating that high integration levels are not always beneficial to the firm.}

African American (AA) fathers who live apart from their children face multiple obstacles to consistent and positive involvement with their children. Consequently, significant numbers of children are bereft of their father's positive involvement. Intervention research that is explicitly focused on promoting the positive involvement of non-resident AA fathers with their young children is limited. The purpose of this article is to describe the study protocol of a randomized trial (RCT) designed to test the Building Bridges to Fatherhood program against a financial literacy comparison condition; and discuss early implementation challenges.
Methods
Fathers (n=180) are recruited to attend 10 group meetings, reimbursed for transportation, given dinner and activity vouchers for spending time with their child, and incentivized with a $40 gift card at each data collection time point. Mothers are incentivized ($40 gift card) at data collection and must be amenable to father child interaction. Intervention targets include father psychological well-being, parenting competence, communication, problem-solving ability; father-mother relationship quality; and child behavioral and emotional/social development.
Results
To date, 57 fathers have been randomized to study condition. Recruitment has been influenced by father and mother hesitancy and the logistics of reaching and maintaining contact with participants. Strategies to surmount challenges to father and mother recruitment and engagement have been developed.
Conclusions
The prospective benefits of positive father involvement to children, fathers and families outweigh the challenges associated with community-based intervention research. The findings from this RCT can inform the body of knowledge on engaging AA non-resident fathers in culturally relevant fatherhood programming.}

This study examines the impact of OCRs characteristics (valence, volume, and variance) on return decisions with a rich multi-year dataset from a major online retailer covering the electronics and furniture category. The main finding is that overly positive review valence (i.e., higher than the long-term product average), induces more purchases, but also more returns. An explanation for these findings is that OCRs help to form product expectations at the moment of purchase. Therefore, the purchase probability increases but the high expectations due to overly positive reviews may not be met, which results in negative expectation disconfirmation and consequently increases return probability as well. The effect of review valence on returns is stronger for novice buyers and for cheaper products. We further find that review volume and variance mainly affect purchase decisions, and have little to no effect on product returns. This study thus demonstrates that products returns should be considered when examining OCR effects, especially because overly positive reviews may hinder a retailer's financial performance, due to large reverse logistics costs associated with product returns.}

We also implement the algorithm in a realistic food rescue and delivery network in Sydney. We test our heuristic algorithm on instances taken from literature and on small instances generated similar to that of Cordeau's benchmark instances and validate our solution approach against the optimal solutions obtained through the exact method before implementing it on food rescue and delivery network. Computational experiments indicate that the proposed method outperforms existing heuristics and is able to solve the real-world scenarios using significantly fewer resources than are employed in practice.}

In this paper, we present a new hybrid fuzzy multiple-criteria decision-making method for selecting the location of a JDC considering sustainability. First, we identify the evaluation criteria for location selection integrating the economic, environmental, and social dimensions of sustainability. Secondly, a fuzzy set is used to translate linguistic preferences into triangular fuzzy numbers. Subjective criteria weights are calculated by combining the decision makers’ superiority linguistic ratings with a fuzzy AHP method. Objective criteria weights are determined by combining superiority linguistic ratings with a fuzzy-entropy method. Then, improved fuzzy TOPSIS is achieved by using weighted criterion distances to rank these alternatives. This permits a more stable ranking order to be obtained compared to traditional fuzzy TOPSIS which uses Euclidean distance. Finally, an empirical location selection and sensitivity analysis study is conducted to illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. This new method allows the location of a JDC to be selected considering sustainability, and will contribute to promoting the sustainable development of China’s express industry and, to some extent, the sustainability and harmony of city development.}

abstract = {In the globalized cold chain network, the effective distribution of perishable food is of utmost importance when transporting multiple types of food with different handling requirements, such as temperature and humidity, for minimizing the food spoilage rate during transportation. Currently, mismanagement of premium fruit and vegetables leads to a huge amount of capital loss such that logistics service providers (LSPs) apply refrigerated trucks to deliver them for the sake of minimizing the food spoilage rate during transportation. Since different types of food have their own different handling requirements, traditional refrigerated distribution management at a fixed environmental condition is insufficient. Without considering such requirements, traditional route planning by merely minimizing the travelling distance is ineffective in maintaining food quality, resulting in an increased likelihood of food deterioration and food chilling injury. In addition, there is a lack of real-time product monitoring to control violations of the required handling requirements in order to prevent delivery of spoilt food to customers. In this paper, an internet of things (IoT)-based route planning system (IRPS) is proposed (i) to design a multi-temperature packaging model, (ii) to develop real-time product monitoring during transportation, and (iii) to optimize routing solutions. Under the IoT framework, the ambient environmental information can be collected automatically by building a wireless sensor network so as to develop total product monitoring during the distribution process. Experiments using the Taguchi method are conducted to examine the most effective packaging model for various products in terms of maximizing duration of optimal environment conditions in tertiary packaging. By integrating the above results and travelling constraints, the optimal delivery routes can be formulated by using genetic algorithms (GAs). With the aid of IRPS, the food spoilage rate during transportation and the time needed in route planning and in the delivery of deteriorated food can be reduced, while customer satisfaction is enhanced.}

Drawing on the concept of metabolic rift we trace the development of productivism in Irish agriculture, given huge impetus by the implementation of an industry-led agri-export strategy, Food Harvest 2020. The consequences of productivism at home are significant principally through depleted environmental support systems and associated potential threats to human wellbeing. The chapter then examines the changing Irish foodscape which has witnessed a rapid expansion of corporate retail and food service outlets. Evidence would suggest that these new forms of food provisioning have increased the availability of energy dense foods with Ireland ranked high in international tables in consumption of fast food and confectionery and low in fruit and vegetables. Paradoxically, despite rising volumes of meat and dairy exports, net food imports have grown faster especially as a consequence of retail supply chain logistics and the drive to cheaper food. Nevertheless, food poverty remains an intractable problem in Ireland and reinforces patterns of consumption that data suggest are evidently deleterious to human health. Yet the state continues to emphasize the need for individual behavior change rather than reforming a food system that, while preoccupied with agri-export success, is responsible for a high burden of disease at home.}

The main foci of the preparedness of JRAT are sustaining rehabilitation in hospitals and community, and prevention of inactivity or disuse of the suffered inhabitants. The principles of JRAT are officially authorized and not volunteer-basis.
Results
At the Kumamoto earthquakes in 2016, the JRAT started working on the next day of the first attack. A total of 2039 rehabilitation professionals worked in the area and another 895 worked for logistics in the next 10 weeks, and he manual of the disaster rehabilitation is revised. Risk of the mega-earthquake of southeast Japan has been estimated as 70% in the next 30 years. Worst scenario in Tokushima with 777,000 inhabitants close to the epicenter, is expecting 46% of the inhabitants being in the shelters, and many disaster-related deaths. The local government appointed physiatrists and allied professionals as the coordinators, and they are reviewing condition of planned refugees’ shelters, and seeking collaboration with other health professionals.
Conclusion
The society which does not have comprehensive information of the disabled and rehabilitation would need to prepare for the massive natural disasters. This is a part of ISPRM-ISCoS collaborative session: supporting global disaster planning and response for SCI in low resource settings.}

abstract = {This paper examines the role of small entrepreneurial companies and their partnerships with large corporations to advance the circular economy (CE). The authors provide insights from a U.S.-based empirical study that involved 12 companies and examined the emerging drivers, current challenges and future opportunities for advancing waste repurposing and product reuse. Many large companies fail to incorporate CE principles into their business strategy due to lack of mandates, costs, logistical hurdles and inertia. This presents an opportunity for entrepreneurial companies with innovative business models to fill the gap and provide critical links for corporations in reverse supply chains while creating new business opportunities with social benefits. The study found that despite the lack of federal regulations in the U.S. a growing number of corporations are partnering with entrepreneurs to reduce waste and advance product reuse. Key drivers for such trends include sustainability commitments and zero waste goals by companies and municipalities, European Union and U.S. state mandates, reputation and the growing focus on local sourcing. Technology, knowledge, and strategic partnerships between entrepreneurs and corporations play a critical role in reducing financial costs, time, energy, environmental impacts and resources, thus helping establish viable business models. The authors propose a new framework for corporate-entrepreneur collaborations to advance a CE. The study contributes to the research on the relationship between entrepreneurial innovation and the development of CE principles within corporate supply chains, a field that is still in its infant stage.}

VAMS absorbs a fixed volume of blood (10μl) and overcomes area bias and homogeneity issues associated with dried blood spot (DBS). This study is the application of VAMS for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) in human capillary blood. A liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) workflow for analysis of VAMS samples was developed and validated. Concentrations of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and its metabolites, desethylhydroxychloroquine (DHCQ), desethylchloroquine (DCQ), and bisdesethylchloroquine (BDCQ), in capillary blood on VAMS samplers were compared to those in venous blood in rheumatoid arthritis patients. Feasibility of capillary blood collected on both VAMS and DBS cards were evaluated on patients. Stability of dried capillary blood on VAMS was also examined. Our results established that VAMS is a simple and accurate sampling technique that delivers the benefits of DBS sampling while overcoming the issues associated with hematocrit and homogeneity. It requires a small blood volume, simplifies sample logistics management, and may allow sample collection in the patient’s home setting.}

Convincing people to drive more fuel-efficiently (“eco-driving”) is often an integral part of these approaches, especially in the transport sector. But there is a lack of studies on the long-term persistence and potential interaction of the effects of incentives and training on energy conservation behavior in general and eco-driving behavior in particular. We address this gap with a twelve months long natural field experiment in a logistics company to analyze the time-dependent and potentially interacting effects of rewards and theoretical training for eco-driving on fuel consumption in a real-world setting. We find an immediate reduction of fuel consumption following the introduction of a non-monetary reward and an attenuation of this effect over time. Theoretical eco-driving training shows no effect, neither short-term nor long-term, highlighting the often neglected necessity to include practical training elements. Contrary to common assumptions, the interaction of incentives and theoretical training does not show an additional reduction effect. Our results demonstrate the difficulty of changing engrained behavior and habits, and underline the need for a careful selection and combination of interventions. Policy implications for public and private actors are discussed.}

abstract = {Objectives
There exists a significant gap in vaccine coverage of the human papillomavirus (HPV) among college-aged students. This study assessed sexual risk-taking behavior among university students and analyzed predictors of HPV vaccine initiation and completion in this population.
Materials and methods
Data (n = 746) were from an anonymous online, cross-sectional survey distributed to university students, between the ages of 19–26 years, at a private Midwestern university. Both chi-square and multivariable logistics regression models estimated the association between sociodemographic characteristics and sexual risk factors (including number of vaginal sexual partners, number of oral sexual partners, initiation of oral sex, and initiation of vaginal sex), with HPV vaccine initiation and completion.
Results
A significant number of participants (40%) had not received a single dose of the HPV vaccine series. Of those who initiated the series, more than half (51%) did not achieve completion. Additionally, a greater number of participants have had multiple (4 or more) oral sexual partners than vaginal sexual partners (25.7% vs. 20.3%). After adjusting for covariates, it was found that sexual risk factors were not significantly associated with HPV vaccine initiation or completion.
Conclusion
HPV vaccine initiation and completion rates are suboptimal among university students. High levels of sexual-risk taking behaviors associated with HPV infection persist, yet are not significant predictors of HPV vaccine behaviors in this age group. To increase uptake among 18–26-year-old students, future public health interventions should focus on HPV vaccine education and uptake across the entire population, irrespective of sexual risk profile.}

abstract = {This study was initiated as a component of a larger undertaking designed to study bone healing in microgravity aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Spaceflight experimentation introduces multiple challenges not seen in ground studies, especially with regard to physical space, limited resources, and inability to easily reproduce results. Together, these can lead to diminished statistical power and increased risk of failure. It is because of the limited space, and need for improved statistical power by increasing sample size over historical numbers, NASA studies involving mice require housing mice at densities higher than recommended in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Research Council, 2011). All previous NASA missions in which mice were co-housed, involved female mice; however, in our spaceflight studies examining bone healing, male mice are required for optimal experimentation. Additionally, the logistics associated with spaceflight hardware and our study design necessitated variation of density and cohort make up during the experiment. This required the development of a new method to successfully co-house male mice while varying mouse density and hierarchical structure. For this experiment, male mice in an experimental housing schematic of variable density (Spaceflight Correlate) analogous to previously established NASA spaceflight studies was compared to a standard ground based housing schematic (Normal Density Controls) throughout the experimental timeline. We hypothesized that mice in the Spaceflight Correlate group would show no significant difference in activity, aggression, or stress when compared to Normal Density Controls. Activity and aggression were assessed using a novel activity scoring system (based on prior literature, validated in-house) and stress was assessed via body weights, organ weights, and veterinary assessment. No significant differences were detected between the Spaceflight Correlate group and the Normal Density Controls in activity, aggression, body weight, or organ weight, which was confirmed by veterinary assessments. Completion of this study allowed for clearance by NASA of our bone healing experiments aboard the ISS, and our experiment was successfully launched February 19, 2017 on SpaceX CRS-10.}

abstract = {Objective
To explore the factors that facilitated or hindered successful implementation of a multi-centered infant lumbar puncture (LP) competency-based education program that required interns to demonstrate skills readiness on a task trainer before performing their first clinical LP.
Methods
In 2013, investigators conducted a qualitative study utilizing semistructured interviews and focus groups of site directors (SDs) from the International Network for Simulation-Based Pediatric Innovation, Research, and Education (INSPIRE) who were responsible for implementing the LP competency-based education program. Transcripts were analyzed using grounded theory to identify and verify emergent themes and subthemes.
Results
Thematic saturation was attained after interviewing 19 SDs in 12 interviews and 3 focus groups. The most significant strategies and barriers were organized into 4 main themes: 1) alignment of different visions to obtain buy-in, 2) balance between providing education versus patient care, 3) acceptance of novel teaching paradigms, and 4) communication logistics. The ability to overcome barriers was influenced by institutional culture on trainee education, patient safety and research; the level of relational coordination between different groups of stakeholders; and the ability of SDs to identify and diversify entrepreneurial strategies.
Conclusions
INSPIRE SDs reveal the challenges of implementing a network-wide competency-based educational initiative that determines interns' readiness to perform LPs in clinical settings. Strategizing to align the common goals of graduate medical training, patient care and research instructs clinician educators and leaders on how to successfully change educational culture in academic medicine.}

To motivate our research we present global logistics data which violates the traditional assumption that lead time demand is normally distributed. We also observe that order crossover is a common and important phenomenon in real supply chains. We present a new method for determining the distribution of the number of open orders. Using this method we identify the distribution of inventory levels when orders and the work-in-process are correlated. This correlation is present when demand is auto-correlated, demand forecasts are generated with non-optimal methods, or when certain ordering policies are present. Our method allows us to obtain exact safety stock requirements for the so-called proportional order-up-to (POUT) policy, a popular, implementable, linear generalization of the OUT policy. We highlight that the OUT replenishment policy is not cost optimal in global supply chains, as we are able to demonstrate the POUT policy always outperforms it under order cross-over. We show that unlike the constant lead-time case, minimum safety stocks and minimal inventory variance do not always lead to minimum costs under stochastic lead-times with order crossover. We also highlight an interesting side effect of minimizing inventory costs under stochastic lead times with order crossover with the POUT policy—an often significant reduction in the order variance.}

Although interest in understanding the mechanics of this process has never wavered, until recently researchers have been vexed by seemingly impenetrable logistics of working with these creatures at a molecular level. Chief among the problems has been the very large size of salamander genomes, and not a single salamander genome has been fully sequenced to date. Recently the enormous gap in sequence information has been bridged by approaches that leverage mRNA as the starting point. Together with functional experimentation, these data are rapidly enabling researchers to finally uncover the molecular mechanisms underpinning the astonishing biological process of limb regeneration.}

All these models are developed for a multi-site manufacturing company, which is coping with various raw material suppliers and Third Party Logistics (3PLs), Distribution Centers (DCs), and customers with wide range of product families.

Therefore, many accurate, heuristic, and meta-heuristic methods have been introduced to solve this problem in recent decades. In this paper, a new meta-heuristic optimization algorithm is introduced to solve the CVRP, which is based on the law of gravity and group interactions. The proposed algorithm uses two of the four basic parameters of velocity and gravitational force in physics based on the concepts of random search and searching agents, which are a collection of masses that interact with each other based on Newtonian gravity and the laws of motion. The introduced method was quantitatively compared with the State-of-the-Art algorithms in terms of execution time and number of optimal solutions achieved in four well-known benchmark problems. Our experiments illustrated that the proposed method could be a very efficient method in solving CVRP and the results are comparable with the results using state-of-the-art computational methods. Moreover, in some cases our method could produce solutions with less number of required vehicles compared to the Best Known Solution (BKS) in a very efficient manner, which is another advantage of the proposed algorithm.}

However, in many countries and for many companies worldwide a complete transition to rail transport of freight is not feasible due to either a lack of available railway infrastructure or high investment costs. With that in mind, this paper aims to assess the potential of road-rail intermodal operations as a strategy to reduce atmospheric emissions, and thereby help mitigate climate change worldwide. This was achieved by quantifying and comparing emissions of CO2, CO, CH4, NOx, hydrocarbons and particulate matter in a case-study that considered road-only and intermodal road-rail routes from 17 production facilities to their nearest port, according to International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) policies, as well as Euro V and EPA (United State Environmental Protection Agency) emission standards. The results showed that an intermodal road-rail operations would reduce emissions by up to 77.4%, be up to 43.48% more fuel-efficient and up to 80% cheaper than operating solely with road transport, posing as a viable strategy to enable more companies and countries to mitigate climate change.}

The respective feedstock plays a critical role in meeting global deployment levels for bioenergy, which in turn are necessary to stabilise global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and atmospheric carbon levels. Many aspects of bioenergy supply chains (such as logistics and trade, supply chain variability, technology learning and transfer, governance, organisational structures) present both challenges and opportunities and relate to all three dimensions of sustainability. Energy and forest systems can be integrated across landscapes and organisations to establish attractive solutions guided by good governance of forest management and biomass use (eg, policies, regulations, standards and certification systems). Nevertheless, substantial gains in forest bioenergy mobilisation can only be achieved with an important increase in forest management intensity, causing a larger appropriation of forest net primary production (NPP). Such intensification would likely require fundamental shifts in the forest systems and considerable societal change, in some countries. A multifaceted policy effort to support a broad array of technological, structural and behavioural changes is needed to enable energy and industrial transitions and the development of supply chains that deliver feedstock to a range of conversion and utilisation routes.}

More and more patients are pursuing minimally invasive surgery, which is becoming the trend for gynecologic surgery today. Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is no exception. With the application of natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery, minimally invasive transvaginal sacrocolpopexy surgery assisted by single-port laparoendoscopy for POP becomes feasible. Here we describe our technique of transvaginal sacrocolpopexy using single-port laparoscopy for middle compartment POP.
Design
Step-by-step explanation of the procedure using video.
Setting
University hospital.
Patient
A 59-year-old woman from China.
Interventions
Transvaginal single-port laparoscopy sacrocolpopexy.
Measurements and Main Results
We performed transvaginal single-port laparoscopy sacrocolpopexy on a 59-year-old woman from China who was diagnosed with POP-Q stage II anterior compartment, stage III middle compartment, stage II posterior compartment. This patient complained of a vaginal mass that had been prolapsed for 3 months. Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee approval was obtained. Vaginal hysterectomy was performed first. Preventative bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was done after a single-port platform was established. Right pelvic peritoneum was incised, from the promontory to the vault. Then, we exposed the rectovaginal and vesicovaginal spaces after injection of a water cushion (normal saline, 0.9% Nacl). A Y-shaped mesh (ARTISYN; Johnson & Johnson international, c/o European Logistics Centre, Diegem, Belgium) was fixed to the posterior vaginal wall and then to the sacral promontory (S1). After closing the pelvic peritoneum the anterior mesh was sutured. Before finishing the surgery we closed the vaginal cuff. The operation last for about 2 hours, with a blood loss of 50 mL. The patient was discharged with complete recovery. A 5-month follow-up showed no prolapse, mesh erosion, or other complications.
Conclusion
Transvaginal single-port laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy is a considerable choice for middle compartment POP. However, more cases should be enrolled, and additional studies are required.}

Urban India is mostly marked by tall buildings that are being built. Due to the economic slowdown and some governmental interventions, these building projects are seeing significant time and cost overrun, ultimately impacting the end-user. As these market pressures rise more and more, real estate developers are considering to adopt emerging technologies to compensate for these construction issues. Indian construction industry is undergoing a paradigm shift from traditional methods of construction to modern methods of construction. Precast technology is one such move which is expected to enhance the productivity of the construction process, thereby, optimizing the requirement of resources on the site, reducing waste generation and resulting in a faster delivery of the projects. While internationally precast technology is considered as a mature technology, in India, it is not widely utilized, despite the advantages. Commonly cited constraints are high costs in comparison to traditional construction, economies of scale, logistics, skill level required, end user friendliness, etc. Primarily, this study focusses on identifying the challenges faced by the precast technology under various categories. This study also presents a cost analysis model for precast technology versus traditional construction to address some of the challenges. Presented cost model is applied to two projects wherein precast technology and conventional technology are utilized to construct the project and an inference is drawn comparing the time and cost aspects of precast technology. Amicable solutions are proposed for adoption of precast construction from an Indian perspective.}

Climate change is an urgent challenge that requires immediate action at the national, regional and local levels. However, a perception that impacts on human well-being and the economy will only be felt in the distant future, and a belief that climate action would require reducing attention towards a host of other environmental and society issues, stand in the way of action. With cities emerging as key actors on climate change as well as other societal and environmental issues, this paper provides a review of the ways urban climate action provides direct and more immediate benefits – in climate terms, ‘co-benefits’ – to public health.
Methods
We focus on the impacts of five key transport policy measures which have been established to yield significant greenhouse gas reductions and substantial economic benefits. These are: (1) compact land use planning to reduce motorized passenger travel demand, (2) passenger modal shift and improving transit efficiency, (3) electrification and passenger vehicle efficiency, (4) freight logistics and (5) freight vehicle efficiency and electrification. We reviewed the literature available on the health impacts of these policy measures.
Results
We show that these measures have great potential to improve public health in urban areas whilst mitigating climate change, and provide arguments that in some cases these benefits may rival, or exceed, benefits to the economy and climate from these actions.
Conclusions
We conclude that climate change action in the transport sector represents a great opportunity for policymakers to develop transport roadmaps that jointly achieve climate change objectives and improve public health in cities.}

The efficacy of brackish water desalination plants powered by on-site fuel cells (FCs) to address a developing country like India's growing water and energy demands in rural areas is discussed. The membrane-thermal hybrid system can achieve very high recovery and manageable brine disposal volume. The desalination plant design and operation is chosen to be conservative because of logistics. The system is optimised based on controlled recoveries of membrane and thermal systems with minimal chemical treatment. Operation under conditions of limited pretreatment, if possible, simplifies membrane operation and maintenance. In other words, the focus is on appropriate technology in a rural setting. The discarded brine can be sold for applications such as building materials, which will be a bonus for the local economy. Although the focus of the chapter has been groundwater desalination, the combined heat and power FC-desalination system is also applicable for treating surface waters. The FC uses locally produced reformed anaerobic digester gas as a source of hydrogen. Important FC power plant features include modular stacks, small footprint, continuous power supply, high efficiency, operation at constant load and short lead time.}

Based on dynamic capabilities and institutional theory, the authors identify, test and explain factors influencing the foreign market selection behavior of European online retailers. Following a dynamic, path-dependent view of the market selection process over time, the hypotheses are tested using a longitudinal database containing observations of the foreign market selection behavior of 140 online retailers in Europe, accounting for 825 market entries over 15 years. The use of a rank-ordered logistic regression model allows the observation of how different attributes contribute to overall evaluations of the attractiveness of chosen markets, assuming that online retailers attempt to maximize the utility of markets for their specific interests, in dependence of the observed factors. The results indicate that market size, rule of law, and local market knowledge, as well as a common language and the logistics performance of a target country have a positive effect on the likelihood of selecting a target country. Although the internet is said to reduce the impact of distance, both cultural and geographic distance as well as added geographic distance still show a negative impact on the selection of foreign markets by online retailers.}

abstract = {Background
The formulary of any Swiss hospital changes quite often, for example, either due to adaptions made by the drug and therapeutics committee, due to drug shortages, or due to market withdrawals of drugs. When changes of the formulary occur, all relating drug data have to be actualized. It is essential not only to integrate new drug data, but also to erase old data to keep all systems up to date. Drug data management is a challenging and ever-expanding task for hospital pharmacies.
Aim of the project
The aim of the project was to optimize drug data management in the Children's Hospital Zurich.
Methods
After interviewing all involved staff members, a flowchart was developed that describes the algorithms to keep all relevant drug data containing systems up to date: – clinical decision support systems; – the logistics and productions software; – pharmacy guidelines and drug information lists. The flowchart serves as working tool to define the adaptations to be made after each mutation of the formulary. Responsibilities for the different topics were defined. A pivot table serves to generate to-do lists and to document the completion of the tasks. This ensures an overview of the status and a controlling tool of all drug data mutations.
Evaluation
Since implementation of the flowchart four months ago, 45 mutations have been documented. The new process proves to be helpful for all involved staff members, improving drug data management und data quality.
Conclusion
As drug data management in the hospital pharmacy is getting more complex, it seems unavoidable to develop new standard procedures. Through the implementation of algorithms and responsibilities by a flowchart, drug data management is optimized.}

The imbalance between different transport modes suggests a need to promote alternative modalities to strengthen the competitiveness and provide a more sustainable economic development. The goal of this paper is to identify logistics managers’ preferences for freight transport service attributes for the case of Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil, and discuss which transport policies could encourage multimodality and more sustainable uses of available transport infrastructure. In this paper we used the stated preference (SP) technique for collecting data on respondents’ choices among hypothetical options. The experimental design was structured using an Efficient design. Discrete choice models were used to identify the preferences of respondents and discuss some possible sustainable policies that could increase the competitiveness of the region. The model structures studied were: multinomial logit; mixed logit as a special case of random coefficients; mixed logit error components- considering panel effect and mixed logit error components – including possible correlations between attributes of intermodal alternatives. Parameters estimated from the models were used to compute subjective value of time savings, which was Euro/t.h 0.34 (R$/t. h 1.088) for the selected model. The direct and cross elasticity values of the probability of choosing a transport mode for the different attributes studied show that the shippers significantly value the fulfilment of delivery time and cost, suggesting that those attributes are the most important ones in the choice of transport mode in this State of Brazil. Simulation results suggest investments for increasing the reliability of intermodal alternatives are more effective to encourage intermodality than cost reductions. Policies and investments to encourage multimodality should prioritize the increase of intermodal alternatives reliability and combined policies of cost reduction and reliability.}

Similarly, 80 experiments were performed on switchgrass of which 72 were used for model development and eight were used for model validation. Regression models were developed for switchgrass and CS that predicted the drying rate based on environmental conditions and swath density. During the day, radiation was found to be the most significant variable that affected the drying rate of switchgrass with a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.5 and 0.49 during different maturity stages. During the night, VPD was the most significant variable that affected the drying rate with r of 0.69 for corn stover (CS) and 0.83–0.85 for switchgrass. The effect of wind speed was variable and was found to be dependent on solar radiation. During the day time, an increase in wind speed removed the heat produced by radiation and thus decreased the drying rate. However, at night, the wind speed was positively correlated with drying rate. Swath density was negatively correlated (r=−0.38) with the drying rate of switchgrass which suggested that biomass should be dried in wide swaths if possible. The model should be a useful tool for planning field logistics and transportation operations for biomass supply.}

Although there is a substantive literature concerned with the geopolitics of space and the ethical issues raised by the use of remote sensing in warfare and counterinsurgency, little study has been made of the critical role played by satellites in public health crises. In this paper, we focus on the 2014–2015 Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic in West Africa, which saw the widespread use of public and commercial satellite-derived data, to investigate how overhead orbital and close-up viewpoints enabled by satellites are shaping attitudes to disease and determining responses to infectious threats. We argue that high-resolution satellite imagery is acting as a spur to a new spatio-temporal targeting of disease that parallels the ever more vertical dimension of contemporary warfare. At the same time, this new visualization of disease is promoting a broader ecological perspective on pathogen emergence. How can these divergent perspectives be reconciled? In addressing this question, we analyze the different uses to which satellite imagery has been put in tracking and mapping Ebola ‘hotspots’ across Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. We also consider the institutional contexts that have enabled the acquisition of this imagery. Given the rapid integration of space technologies in epidemiology and health logistics, there is now a need to examine how and with what consequences remote-sensing and communication technologies may be reconfiguring the practices and scope of global health.}

Spontaneous anticoagulation-related intracerebral hemorrhage accounts for up to a quarter of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage cases and is associated with higher hematoma volume and a worse outcome. Guidelines recommend rapid anticoagulant reversal but mode and timing are not specified and optimal strategy is uncertain. Variability in everyday practice is unknown.
Methods
An invitation to a web-based survey was sent to 85 Dutch stroke neurologists in different hospitals, with questions about importance, timing, and medical management of spontaneous anticoagulation-related intracerebral hemorrhage.
Results
In total, 61 (72%) neurologists completed the survey. Nearly all (97%) deemed rapid anticoagulant reversal important. A local guideline for management of anticoagulant reversal was used in 80% of the hospitals. Most neurologists (56%) estimated anticoagulant reversal in anticoagulation-related intracerebral hemorrhage to start later than intravenous thrombolysis in ischemic stroke. Few (5%) thought it was quicker. A minority (28%) of the hospitals started anticoagulation reversal without waiting for laboratory test results or consulting a specialist in hemostasis. Prothrombin complex concentrate was used by all neurologists for vitamin K antagonist reversal and by most (74%) for reversal of thrombin inhibitors and factor Xa inhibitors (72%). Anticoagulation reversal was initiated at the emergency department according to 89% of the respondents.
Conclusion
Variability in logistics in acute management of spontaneous anticoagulation-related intracerebral hemorrhage was demonstrated. Anticoagulant reversal is deemed important, but is estimated to have a longer door-to-needle time than alteplase in thrombolysis for ischemic stroke by most neurologists. Several delaying factors were found. These factors might have an impact on outcome.}

In this study biopsies from individual fruit displaying contrasting ripening behavior (slow vs fast) and subjected to different storage conditions (immediately after harvest, 30 d regular air at 5°C and 30 d at 5°C and 4kPa O2 and 6kPa CO2) were analyzed for targeted fatty acid analysis and cell wall enzyme activity combined with a more integrative approach based on gel free proteomics LC–MS/MS. The high throughput proteomics was capable of discriminating between slow and fast ripening avocado fruit. Proteins that were mainly less abundant in the slow ripening phenotype were annotated to correct protein folding, translation and de novo synthesis and higher abundant proteins were annotated to amino sugar and nucleotide metabolism, detoxification and stress response and proteolysis. Our study opens new insights into the causes of heterogeneous ripening and may provide new markers for avocado ripening at harvest and after prolonged storage.}

The event brought together leading stakeholders in the cell therapy bioprocessing field to identify present and future challenges and propose potential solutions to automation in cell therapy bioprocessing. Here, we review and summarize discussions from the event. Deep biological understanding of a product, its mechanism of action and indication pathogenesis underpin many factors relating to bioprocessing and automation. To fully exploit the opportunities of bioprocess automation, therapeutics developers must closely consider whether an automation strategy is applicable, how to design an ‘automatable’ bioprocess and how to implement process modifications with minimal disruption. Major decisions around bioprocess automation strategy should involve all relevant stakeholders; communication between technical and business strategy decision-makers is of particular importance. Developers should leverage automation to implement in-process testing, in turn applicable to process optimization, quality assurance (QA)/ quality control (QC), batch failure control, adaptive manufacturing and regulatory demands, but a lack of precedent and technical opportunities can complicate such efforts. Sparse standardization across product characterization, hardware components and software platforms is perceived to complicate efforts to implement automation. The use of advanced algorithmic approaches such as machine learning may have application to bioprocess and supply chain optimization. Automation can substantially de-risk the wider supply chain, including tracking and traceability, cryopreservation and thawing and logistics. The regulatory implications of automation are currently unclear because few hardware options exist and novel solutions require case-by-case validation, but automation can present attractive regulatory incentives.}

Results showed that heat shock prior to CA storage significantly reduced ripening heterogeneity in early and middle season fruit while N2+CA did not. Pectin methyl esterase (PME) and polygalacturonase (PG) activity did not display significant differences among treatments. Additionally, none of the treatments altered the fatty acid profile. ACS transcript for early and middle season fruit kept constant during storage for heat+CA, CA and N2+CA. ACO instead displayed less abundance after 21d storage for all treatments of early season fruit. These results point to ripening synchronization in Hass avocado subjected to heat to be related to induction of metabolic processes related to ethylene (biosynthesis), possibly at the action level (receptors) but the efficiency of the heat treatment was related to the maturity stage of the batch.}

Such recycling system has the benefits of reducing environmental pollution, boosting the economy by creating new jobs, and generating income from trading the recyclable materials. This leads to the formation of a global reverse supply chain (GRSC) of solid waste. In this paper, we investigate the design of such a GRSC with a special emphasis on three aspects; (1) uncertainty of waste collection levels, (2) associated carbon emissions, and (3) challenges posed by the supply chain’s global aspect, particularly the maritime transportation costs and currency exchange rates. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to integrate the three above-mentioned important aspects in the design of a GRSC. We have used mixed integer-linear programming method along with robust optimization to develop the model which is validated using a sample case study of e-waste management. Our results show that using a robust model by taking the complex interactions characterizing global reverse supply chain networks into account, we can create a better GRSC. The effect of uncertainties and carbon constraints on decisions to reduce costs and emissions are also shown.}

Corn (maize) ethanol has served as an alternative to petroleum-based gasoline over the past few decades and currently accounts for nearly 90% of total U.S. renewable biofuels. In recent years, research interests have transitioned to biofuels recovered from lignocellulosic biomass due, in part, to the food-fuel controversy and the “ethanol blend” wall issue. However, the sustainable development of the U.S. lignocellulosic biofuels industry faces a variety of challenges, including feedstock costs and availability, high production and capital costs, and policy and market fluctuations. Literature suggests that buyer–supplier relationship management has the potential to solidify the supply chain and bring stability to commercialization plans. This study conducted semi-structured interviews with three lignocellulosic biofuel producers to explore relationships with their ethanol biofuel customers. Results show that refiners and blenders of gasoline were the primary customers of corn ethanol with fuel marketing companies as secondary intermediaries. Meanwhile, communication, trust, commitment, and power between participating parties were identified as important relationship attributes. To strengthen biofuel buyer–supplier relationships, this study identified manufacturing of consistent and regulated products and communication regarding logistics and environmental benefits of biofuels as key relationship management activities. This research provides business-to-business marketers of biofuels with a better understanding of relationship management and offers insights into the biofuel refinery-to-market value stream for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers.}

In this paper, we have proposed a new concept called “prevention reliability” which prevents the network from intentional disruption and increases reliability before any attack. In other words, prevention reliability prevents disruption by inserting optimum number of fake items beside real items in the network to make a complicated environment for hostile. In this way, distinguishing real items would be more complicated, and so make more prevention for real items. In this paper, the reliable warehouse location problem is modeled by this concept and solutions are demonstrated by four data sets: a small data set is used to verify the model and two larger examples are used to check the efficiency of the model. Finally, a real world case study in the field of Tehran relief warehouses is investigated. A comparative analysis is also presented to illustrate the efficiency of proposed concept.}

Solutions based on concepts and technologies of the “Internet of Things” or “cyber physical systems” can be used to implement monitoring as well as self-organization of production, maintenance or logistics processes. However, integration of new digital tools in existing heterogeneous manufacturing IT systems and integration of machines and devices into manufacturing environments is an expensive and tedious task. Therefore, integration issues on IT and manufacturing level significantly prevent agile manufacturing. Especially small and medium-sized enterprises do not have the expertise or the investment possibilities to realize such an integration. To tackle this issue, we present the approach of the Manufacturing Integration Assistant - MIALinx. The objective is to develop and implement a lightweight and easy-to-use integration solution for small and medium-sized enterprises based on recent web automation technologies. MIALinx aims to simplify the integration using simple programmable, flexible and reusable “IF-THEN” rules that connect occurring situations in manufacturing, such as a machine break down, with corresponding actions, e.g., an automatic maintenance order generation. For this purpose, MIALinx connects sensors and actuators based on defined rules whereas the rule set is defined in a domain-specific, easy-to-use manner to enable rule modeling by domain experts. Through the definition of rule sets, the workers’ knowledge can be also externalized. Using manufacturing-approved cloud computing technologies, we enable robustness, security, and a low-effort, low-cost integration of MIALinx into existing manufacturing environments to provide advanced digital tools also for small and medium-sized enterprises.}

The objective of this study is to investigate the five-year reintervention rate of uterine artery embolization (UAE) for symptomatic leiomyomas and to identify potential predictive factors of reintervention.
Methods
From March 2011 to February 2012, 92 consecutive women (mean age 41.9 years, range 28–55 years) underwent bilateral UAE. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed at three-month follow-up. After annual follow-up, a survey on clinical outcome and reintervention incidences was performed at five-year follow-up. Potential predictive factors of reintervention were evaluated.
Results
Of the 67 patients, menorrhagia and/or bulk-related symptoms were resolved after UAE in all but one patient (98.5%). At median follow-up of 60 months (range, 5–60 months), reintervention rate was 10.4%, with seven reintervention cases (five myomectomy and two hysterectomy cases). Complete (100%) or near complete (90–99%) infarction rate of the dominant leiomyoma was 96.4% (54 of 56). Independent factors of reintervention on multivariate logistics regression analysis included near complete or partial (<90%) infarction of the dominant leiomyoma (odds ratio [OR] 22.238; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.405–205.620; p = 0.006), as well as the presence of non-dominant viable leiomyomas (OR 12.134; 95% CI 1.213–121.409; p = 0.034).
Conclusion
UAE provides excellent and sustained symptom improvement of symptomatic leiomyomas with a low reintervention rate at five-year follow-up. In addition to near complete or partial infarction of the dominant leiomyoma on follow-up MRI, the presence of viable non-dominant leiomyomas indicates a higher risk of reintervention.}

In particular, small- and medium-sized enterprises may transport few items that cannot completely utilize the container space, called the less-than-container loading problem (LCL). To our best knowledge, few studies have addressed the present LCL problem. Furthermore, a freight forwarder in practice wants to optimize the space utilization in containers from different shippers, while avoiding the mixing of cargoes (boxes) from different customers to reduce the conflicts of loading and unloading goods in different ports. Focusing on realistic needs, this study aims to develop an extended priority-based hybrid genetic algorithm (EP-HGA) for the present LCL problem to determine the loading patterns. In particular, the proposed approach integrates the encoding based on cargo priority and cargo layer via the deepest-bottom-left fill method and the adaptive auto tuning parameters of the proposed EP-HGA to improve the efficiency and effectiveness. Numerical experiments were designed to compare the results of the proposed EP-HGA with conventional approaches for validation. The results have shown the practical viability of the proposed approach to effectively solve the LCL problem. This study concludes with a discussion of future research.}

The uncertainties of supply-side (upstream) externalities (e.g., collection and logistics) represent the key challenges in bioenergy supply chains and lead to reduce cross-cutting sustainability benefits. We propose a mixed biomass-based energy supply chain (consisting of mixed-mode bio-refineries and mixed-pathway transportation) and a multi-criteria decision making framework to address the upstream challenges. Our developed framework supports decisions influencing the economic and environmental dimensions of sustainability. Economic analysis employs a support vector machine technique, to predict the pattern of uncertainty parameters, and a stochastic optimization model, to incorporate uncertainties into the model. The stochastic model minimizes the total annual cost of the proposed mixed supply chain network by using a genetic algorithm. Environmental impact analysis employs life cycle assessment to evaluate the global warming potential of the cost-effective supply chain network. Our presented approach is capable of enhancing sustainability benefits of bioenergy industry infrastructure. A case study for the Pacific Northwest is used to demonstrate the application of the methodology and to verify the models. The results indicate that mixed supply chains can improve sustainability performance over traditional supply infrastructures by reducing costs (up to 24%) and environmental impacts (up to 5%).}

The association was mobilized polemically by US politicians and hard-line drug warriors to attack needle exchange policies and funding. In turn, program restrictions limiting access to syringes at the Vancouver exchange may have interfaced with a complex conjunction of historical, geographic, political economic and cultural forces and physiological vulnerabilities to create an extraordinary HIV risk environment: (1) ghettoization of services for indigent populations in a rapidly gentrifying, post-industrial city; (2) rural–urban migration of vulnerable populations subject to historical colonization and current patterns of racism; and (3) the flooding of North America with inexpensive powder cocaine and heroin, and the popularity of crack. In fact, we will never know with certainty the precise cause for the extreme seroincidence rates in Vancouver in the early to mid-1990s. The tendency for modern social epidemiology to decontextualize research subjects and assign excessive importance to discrete, “magic bullet” variables resulted in a counterproductive scientific and political debate in the late 1990s that has obfuscated potentially useful practical lessons for organizing the logistics of harm reduction services – especially syringe exchange – to better serve the needs of vulnerable populations and to mitigate the effects of political-economically imposed HIV risk environments. We would benefit from humbly acknowledging the limits of public health science and learn to recognize the unintended consequences of well-intentioned interventions rather than sweep embarrassing histories under the rug.}

These efforts continue to the present day with the most recent proposal made in 2014. Yet all efforts to merge the two largest container ports in North America have failed. A review of attempts to promote or force the merger of the two ports was undertaken to identify the motivating factors behind the merger proposals, how the merger concepts were initiated and why they failed. Those who proposed merging the ports were typically business groups, port users or elected officials but not port administrators. Merger proposals were often motivated by the desire to eliminate what merger proponents viewed as destructive competition, duplication of facilities, or because one port coveted the resources of the other. Yet, all merger proposals have failed to gain widespread support for two primary reasons. First, all proposals came from outside the port administration, often generated without any port knowledge or participation and limited stakeholder involvement. Second, none of the merger proposals were accompanied by an objective analysis identifying the benefits to accrue to both port cities from a merger. Although attempts to merge the two ports failed, cooperative efforts between the ports increased in the 1980's, spurred by problems confronting both port administrations, that is, the impacts of containerization on the surrounding communities. The ports used a variety of governance tools to affect cooperative arrangements including creation of quasi-independent single purpose authorities. Initial efforts focused on improving hinterland infrastructure. The increased use of “discussion agreements” approved by the Federal Maritime Administration allowed the ports to expand cooperative efforts to environmental and logistics matters. The willingness and initiatives of the ports to cooperate, when necessary, has negated serious consideration of merger proposals. Instead, the two ports have increasingly expanded cooperative efforts to address common issues while retaining their independent jurisdictions.}

Against the constraints in delivering sufficient houses, prefabrication as a sustainable solution for housing has been increasingly advocated for its potential merits of better quality, construction safety and cleaner built environment. However, schedule delay caused by various risks affected the prefabrication housing production (PHP) in Hong Kong. This problem can be further worsened when the manufacturing sector of PHP has entirely moved to offshore areas in the Pearl River Delta region. This study applies system dynamics to recognize and investigate the potential effect of various risks on the scheduling of prefabrication housing construction projects through the employment of Vensim software package. The simulation results show that schedule risks, namely low information interoperability between different enterprise resource planning systems (LIIBDERPS), logistics information inconsistency due to human errors probability (LIIHEP), Delay of delivery of precast element to site (DDPES), and Design information gap between designer and manufacturer (DIGDM) significantly contribute to the schedule delay in PHP. However, schedule is more sensitive toward LIIBDERPS than for the other three risks, indicating that LIIBDERPS should be monitored and given priority. The system dynamic model serves as an effective tool for quantitatively evaluating the effect of various risks on the schedule of PHP, offering valuable references for managers though comparing simulation results under different risk scenarios, so that potential risks that might lead to schedule delay could be identified and handled in advance.}

The former ends its life at the last stage of the distribution chain, the latter requires reverse flows to collect, recondition and, then, reuse it. Costs and emissions associated to the two types of packaging containers are different in nature, i.e. raw materials and landfill cost and emissions vs. reverse logistic costs and emissions, so that their choice is not univocal. Furthermore, such choice heavily affects the supply chain network structure and management. This paper addresses this topic aiming at designing a supply chain network including the packaging container best selection, storage/handling node location and flow allocation. An original bi-objective mixed integer linear programming model supports the decisional process. Despite the approach is general, a deep focus is on fresh fruit and vegetable distribution chain because of disposable and reusable packaging containers coexist in practice. The model looks at the cost and environmental impact minimisation over the whole network getting the Pareto frontier and supporting the logistic managers, industrial practitioners and policy makers in the network design and management. A real instance from Emilia-Romagna region, Italy, showcases the model application getting the economic and environmental optima together with best-balance configurations. Results stress the convenience of mixing reusable and disposable packaging containers to reach a global optimum. 47.1% reusable and 52.9% disposable is a possible good balance configuration reducing emissions while containing the cost increase.}

To achieve low-carbon development, some industries, such as logistics and municipal solid waste, have already taken action, but tourism has not attached sufficient importance to this issue. This paper designs an ecotourism system including tourism, carbon waste (solid waste and sewage), and ecology (water supply and green areas) to simulate low-carbon ecotourism through a quantitative approach. This paper explores the tourism system as well as some interactive factors and studies their quantitative relationship based on historical data. A feedback-loop dynamical system model is designed to simulate tourism, waste carbon, and ecology simultaneously. Finally, a case study applying the feedback-loop dynamical system model to Leshan City, a typical travel destination with colorful natural resources in western China, is conducted to indicate the development of ecotourism in an environmentally friendly economy, which verifies the positive effects of the model. Results show a coordinating upward tendency of tourism, solid waste carbon, and ecology from the dynamical model. When tourism increases, solid waste accumulation increases; however, the amount of sewage dumped directly into nature decreases sharply. After analysis of investment policy scenarios, the research indicates that more funds for sewage treatment will attract more tourists. To maintain the equilibrium of carbon waste, more funds shall be invested in solid waste treatment in the long term. Some discussions about local policy are included.}

abstract = {Background
Growing conflict and insecurity played a major role in precipitating polio outbreaks in the Horn of Africa and the Middle East. In Angola, the early post-conflict situation was characterized by the presence of many inaccessible zones and districts due to insecurity and poor infrastructure. Partnership with the Angolan Army health service (AAHS) was one of the innovative strategies that the Polio Eradication Initiative (PEI) introduced into the country to support the polio vaccination campaigns in insecure and hard to reach zones.
Methods
Before embarking on creating a partnership with Angolan military it was essential to make high-level advocacy with top military decision makers to engage the leadership in the process for better and sustainable support to the strategy. The principal supports provided by the AAHS were the administration of oral polio vaccine, vitamin A, deworming agents, social mobilization, monitoring campaign quality, and surveillance. Distribution of logistics using military vehicles and helicopters to hard to reach and insecure zones was also part of the support.
Results
Using this partnership it was possible to reach a significant number of children in insecure and hard to reach areas with polio vaccine and other child survival interventions. The military partnership also contributed in increasing the demand and addressing rejection for the polio vaccine.
Conclusion
Military is a potentially productive force that can be used for any development activities in any country. The Angolan experience has demonstrated that it is possible to form a partnership with the military for basic health intervention activities with little training and investment.}
