abstract = {BACKGROUND: The operationalization of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR-T) therapy for hematologic malignancies can be complex for patients and their caregivers. In the weeks before CAR-T therapy, patients must process large amounts of information and coordinate logistics involving caregivers, lodging, and transportation. Immediately following CAR-T therapy, patients must be monitored closely for toxicities such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS). In the months following CAR-T therapy, patients may be referred back to local oncologists without a clear plan for managing potential late effects such as hypogammaglobulinemia or neuropsychiatric complications (Chakraborty 2021). Mobile health (mHealth) apps may be able to improve the patient experience during CAR-T therapy by facilitating care coordination, home-based toxicity monitoring, and patient education (Banerjee 2021). By empowering patients and caregivers to better understand CAR-T therapy and actively participate in their care, mHealth tools may ultimately augment workflows for CAR-T clinics as well. However, the feasibility and acceptability of such supportive mHealth apps during CAR-T therapy have not been established. STUDY DESIGN: We have designed a “Companion for CAR-T” mHealth app to assist with care coordination, toxicity monitoring, and patient education during CAR-T therapy. Key components of the app are summarized in the Figure. In brief, pre-CAR-T components include educational videos and dynamic calendars to assist patients with coordinating logistics. Post-CAR-T components include app-based prompts to input body temperature daily, an electronic Immune Effector Cell-Associated Encephalopathy (eICE) screening tool for ICANS that can be administered by caregivers, and a patient-specific long-term survivorship care plan. Global app components include an ‘Appointment Companion’ to facilitate patient-provider discussions during appointments as well as a digital CAR-T wallet card to convey key health-related information to other healthcare providers. We plan to investigate the “Companion for CAR-T” app through a pilot study of 20 patients receiving commercially available CAR-T therapies for any hematologic malignancy at our institution. Co-primary endpoints include (1) app feasibility, defined as the percentage of patients who access all 5 core modules shown in the Figure at least once; and (2) app acceptability, defined as the percentage of patients who agree that the app was helpful during their experience with CAR-T therapy. Secondary endpoints include the incidence of fevers or eICE deficits recorded via the app. Exploratory endpoints include longitudinal trends in patient-reported outcomes such as emotional distress at each clinic visit. DISCUSSION: If feasibility and acceptability of the “Companion for CAR-T” app are demonstrated through this pilot study, we plan to launch a multicenter randomized Phase 2 study of this mHealth tool versus usual care to assess its effect on perceived stress and decisional conflict. Other important steps for our group include the translation of app content into different languages and the provision of tablet computing devices for patients who do not own smartphones. Once validated and expanded in these aforementioned ways, potential strengths of the “Companion for CAR-T” app include its ability to be personalized easily with information specific to individual CAR-T therapies, malignancies, and centers.

abstract = {Purpose
Non-Compliance has been defined as an independent late risk factor for patients with chronic Mechanic Circulatory Support. Times in therapeutic range (TTR) above 70% in Vitamin K based anticoagulation (VKA) are only achieved with INR self-management and additional telephone surveillance requiring tremendous logistics and compliance.We investigated an alternative anticoagulation regime with Apixaban and Multiplate controlled platelet inhibition therapy in this sensitive cohort.
Methods
Since July 2014, 48 patients with a mean age 65,6 years (36 to 82), supported by Medtronic HVAD (47) or Abbott Heartmate 3 (1), identified as non-compliant to VKA were anticoagulated by Apixaban 5mg bid and either Aspirin or Clopidogrel. Non-compliance was defined as either an inability to become trained to perform INR self-management or 3 INR values requiring intervention.Cerebrovascular events were assessed.
Results
Mean anticoagulation with Apixaban was 371 days (24 - 810), sum 17815 days. 33 patients received Clopidogrel, 14 Aspirin. Overall, 5 cerebrovascular events (10,5%) were documented. Of these, 2 were fatal hemorrhagic (4,1%) and 3 were ischemic events (6,3%), all resolving to a Modified Rankin Score of <3. One-year freedom of cerebrovascular, ischemic or hemorrhagic cerebrovascular events were 90%, 96% and 94%, respectively.
Conclusion
Apixaban 5 mg bid and Multiplate-controlled platelet inhibition appears to be a safe and effective alternative in patients non-compliant to standard VKA in a single center observation. Larger trials to investigate Apixaban's potential to replace VKA as standard of care are needed.}

abstract = {Background
Between 25%-50% of patients hospitalized with (COVID-19) suffer cardiovascular events. Limited information is available to identify those greatest risk for cardiac complications. The objective of this study is to analyze risk factors associated with cardiovascular events in COVID-19 patients.
Methods
This retrospective cohort study of 700 inpatients was conducted at nine hospitals within a large urban midwestern city. Data was collected from March 9, 2020, to June 20, 2020. Inclusion criteria included all COVID-19 inpatients and excluded non-inpatients. Predictor variables included demographics, comorbidities, and current clinical data. The outcomes were CE and mortality. Cardiovascular events included heart failure, deep-vein thrombosis, myocardial infarction, pulmonary edema, stroke, cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, reduced ejection fraction, cardiac arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, and cardiac arrest. Mann-Whitney U, Chi-square, or Fisher's exact tests were used to examine differences in groups with and without CE. Multiple logistics regression analyses were used to determine predictors of CE and Kaplan-Meier was conducted for survival comparisons between groups. A p-value of ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Inpatients with COVID-19 had greater odds of having a CE (n=126) if they were older, male, black, and had pulmonary and cardiovascular comorbidities (p < 0.001). Inpatients who had higher levels of potassium, glucose, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, activated partial prothrombin time, domain-dimer, interleukin-6, white blood cell count, and oxygen requirements had an increased odds of having a CE (p < 0.05). Cardiovascular events were associated with higher mortality (45.24%). Blacks had greater odds of CEs in the presence of diabetes and cardiovascular comorbidities (p=0.008, p=0.014, respectively), however, blacks had better survival, despite having greater risk.
Conclusions
Multiple risk factors for cardiovascular events and death were identified in this sample of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, and mortality was increased significantly in those inpatients who had CEs.}

abstract = {Objectives
This study investigated different patterns of physical activity (PA; frequency, intensity, and duration) among employees during and after participating in a worksite health-promotion intervention over a period of one year. The study aimed to assess whether different patterns of PA were associated with perceived competence and motivational regulations for PA.
Design
A cluster randomized controlled trial with a delayed-intervention control group. The design of the group-based intervention was based on the tenets of Self-determination theory (SDT).
Method
The study consisted of employees (N = 202, M age = 42.5) working with manual labor in an (Anonymized) transport and logistics company. A person-centered approach was applied in order to explore if there were different latent trajectories within the sample related to PA. The data was analyzed with latent class growth analysis (LCGA) and the modified BCH method.
Results
The LCGA identified three PA trajectories: (1) employees high at baseline who declined significantly (n = 16), (2) employees who remained stable at a moderate level (n = 55), and (3) the majority of employees who reported low levels at baseline and increased significantly (n = 128). High levels of PA were associated with higher levels of perceived competence and autonomous forms of motivation for, which is in line with the tenets of SDT. Contrary to study hypothesis, controlled forms of motivation increased in all three trajectories after the intervention.
Conclusions
Different trajectories of PA were found, and the intervention was able to attract employees with low levels of PA.}

abstract = {Backgrounds
Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) occurring during the preoperative waiting period may affect the prognosis of traumatic patients, but there still lack of relevant data. This study aimed to address the preoperative DVT in isolated calcaneal fractures.
Methods
Patients who presented with isolated calcaneal fracture and received preoperative Duplex ultrasound scanning of bilateral lower extremities for detection of DVT between October and December 2018 were eligible for inclusion. Relevant data were prospectively collected, including demographics, comorbidities, lifestyles, injury, and laboratory biomarkers at admission. Univariate analyses were used to compare the difference of each variable between patients with and without DVT. Multivariate logistics regression analysis was used to identify the independent risk factors for DVT.
Results
Totally, 770 patients met the criteria and were included, and 24 (3.1%) had preoperative DVT diagnosed at mean of 5.3 days after injury, all of which were asymptomatic. Among patients with DVTs, 36 thrombi were found and 29 (80.6%) were in distal veins. Eight patients had DVTs in multiple veins, but no patients had bilateral DVTs. The multivariate analyses showed older age (≥58 vs <58 years, OR = 3.84), delay from injury to DUS (in each day, OR = 1.23) and elevated plasma D-dimer level (≥1.79 vs <1.79 mg/L, OR = 2.53) were independent risk factors associated with DVT.
Conclusions
Due to low prevalence of DVT in isolated fracture, routine throboprophylaxis is not recommended. However, emphasis should be given in older patients with delay to admission and elevated plasma D-dimer level for targeted detection of DVT and rapid therapeutic intervention.}

abstract = {Artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) – small sized, largely unrecognized, rudimentary, and an informal form of mining – occurs in more than 70 countries around the world and is mainly hailed for its socioeconomic benefits and reviled for its environmental devastation. As a result, many people are confused about the future of ASM. In Ghana, the government banned ASM in 2017 and formed a security taskforce drawn from the military and police to crack down on nomadic and local ASM workers who defy the ban. This approach is unsustainable, deals less with the fundamental problems, and increases poverty among the already impoverished local populations who depend on this type of mining as their only means of livelihood. To support the argument for sustainable reforms, revenue growth decomposition and growth accounting analyses were performed to determine the factors shaping ASM revenue over 25 years (1990–2016). Results show that production (gold output) is the most important factor that influences revenue growth from ASM, contrary to the usual view that the price of the metal is mainly responsible for the increase in revenue. Thus, increasing labor hours in ASM could significantly increase mining revenue, reduce unemployment, and improve local commerce. We strongly conclude that sustainable reforms such as increasing local participation in decision making, education and training, adoption of improved technology, strengthening regulatory institutions, legislation and enforcement of enactments, and the provision of technical support and logistics could ensure socio-environmental sustainability.}

Accordingly, the scope of HHC services is also expanding from typical nursing and postoperative care at home to cover all types of needs of elderly patients (e.g., personal care, drug delivery and meal services). This paper aims to address the pressing demand for HHC services and develop a novel and effective mathematical model and solution methodology for supporting health care service delivery decisions. Our decision support framework captures the real needs of HHC services, including the challenges of creating simultaneous schedules and route plans for a set of HHC staff and Home Delivery Vehicles (HDVs) under the requirements of synchronization between HHC staff and HDVs visits, multiple visits to patients, multiple routes of HDVs and pickup/delivery visits related precedence for HDVs. A Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model is developed to characterize the optimization problem. Considering the computational complexity of the problem, a Hybrid Genetic Algorithm (HGA) is proposed to suggest HHC planning decisions. The model formulation and proposed HGA are examined on real-life instances for demonstrating its practicality and randomly generated test instances for assessing the scalability of the proposed approach. The results show the effectiveness and efficiency of our solution methodology. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm provided a good performance even with an increasing number of required synchronized services, whereas the heuristic tactics facilitate the HGA to produce better-quality solutions in a significantly shorter time. Our framework is expected to contribute to an important aspect of shared healthcare mobility.}

abstract = {In this paper, we address a green delivery-pickup problem for Home Hemodialysis Machines (HHMs) categorized as scarce commodities. The system supplies the HHMs either from the central depot of the company or from the individual owners. Based on the sharing economy concept, the individuals who own the HHM devices can involve in this home health care system and share them with others through the fleet of the company to make money. After delivery of portable HHM devices to the clients (patients), they will be collected, disinfected and reallocated to fulfill the demands of the other customers. Moreover, respecting the environmental concerns, the vehicles’ fuel consumption and consequently the GHG emissions are realistically assumed as a function of the vehicles’ load, such that the company and especially the individual owners contribute to reducing GHG emissions, in addition to the primary economic motivations. Current research provides a bi-objective mixed-integer linear programming model which seeks minimizing total system cost and total carbon emissions. In order to solve the problem, Torabi and Hassini’s (TH) technique is applied and then a multi-objective meta-heuristic algorithm, self-learning non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (SNSGA-II), is developed for medium- and large-sized problems. Finally, the application of the problem is investigated by a real case study from the healthcare sector. Numerical analyses indicate that the proposed green sharing-enabled model has a meaningful impact on both operational-level logistics determinations as well as the environmental important attainment indicators. As notable savings are guaranteed in terms of total system cost and emission, the proposed model has a great potential to provide the item sharing activities with a proper sustainable solution.}

abstract = {Introduction
The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has hit the European region disproportionately. Many HIV clinics share staff and logistics with infectious disease facilities, which are now on the frontline in tackling COVID-19. Therefore, this study investigated the impact of the current pandemic situation on HIV care and continuity of antiretroviral treatment (ART) supplies in CEE countries.
Methods
The Euroguidelines in Central and Eastern Europe (ECEE) Network Group was established in February 2016 to review standards of care for HIV in the region. The group consists of professionals actively involved in HIV care. On March 19, 2020 we decided to review the status of HIV care sustainability in the face of the emerging SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Europe. For this purpose, we constructed an online survey consisting of 23 questions. Respondents were recruited from ECEE members in 22 countries, based on their involvement in HIV care, and contacted via email.
Results
In total, 19 countries responded: Albania, Armenia, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Georgia, Greece, Hungary, Lithuania, Macedonia, Poland, Republic of Moldova, Russia, Serbia, Turkey, and Ukraine. Most of the respondents were infectious disease physicians directly involved in HIV care (17/19). No country reported HIV clinic closures. HIV clinics were operating normally in only six countries (31.6%). In 11 countries (57.9%) physicians were sharing HIV and COVID-19 care duties. None of the countries expected shortage of ART in the following 2 weeks; however, five physicians expressed uncertainty about the following 2 months. At the time of providing responses, ten countries (52.6%) had HIV-positive persons under quarantine.
Conclusions
A shortage of resources is evident, with an impact on HIV care inevitable. We need to prepare to operate with minimal medical resources, with the aim of securing constant supplies of ART. Non-governmental organizations should re-evaluate their earlier objectives and support efforts to ensure continuity of ART delivery.}

Currently the demand and supply of CS is not yet well understood, largely due to the limited real-world data. This study aims to first fill this gap by analyzing the real-world CS data from the city of Atlanta, GA between April 2015 and August 2018. We first present an overview of the real-world CS data in three aspects: (1) the CS pricing scheme; (2) the CS spatial and temporal delivery patterns; and (3) comparison of preferences between the senders’ requests and the couriers’ bids. The analysis finds that the CS service has a clear price advantage over FedEx in the same-day and express service, as well as in the large, extra large, and huge size package delivery. The data analysis also reveals considerable discrepancies between senders’ and couriers’ preferences. We then compare two classes of the state-of-the-art Deep Learning (DL) methods in their ability to predict short-term CS delivery trip production. One class captures only the temporal features, namely the Long Short-term Memory Neural Network (LSTM), the Bidirectional Long Short-term Memory Neural Network (BDLSTM), and the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). The other class considers both spatial and temporal features, namely Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), CNN-LSTM, and ConvLSTM. The results show that ConvLSTM has overall the best predictive performance among the six DL methods considered, proving the importance of capturing both the spatial and temporal features of the delivery trip production data, as well as the convolutional nature of the spatial and temporal features in the data.}

abstract = {Background
The amount and type of intraoperative fluid in patients with pulmonary resection currently are controversial. This study evaluated the dose–response relationship between intraoperative fluid administration and postoperative outcomes in minimally invasive lobectomy patients.
Methods
A retrospective analysis of adult patients undergoing minimally invasive lobectomy between May 2016 and April 2017 was performed. The primary exposure variables were intraoperative total fluid infusion rate and intraoperative colloid infusion rate. The observation outcomes were postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs), acute kidney injury, in-hospital mortality, postoperative length of stay, and costs. Univariate analyses and multivariate analyses were performed.
Results
In 446 patients all resections were minimally invasive lobectomies. Two hundred one PPCs were observed in 172 patients. Binary logistics regression analysis demonstrated that compared with the moderate group of intraoperative total fluid infusion rate, the risk for PPCs was significantly increased at restrictive (odds ratio [OR], 2.202; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.189–4.078; p = 0.012), moderately liberal (OR, 2.743; 95% CI, 1.451–5.184; p = 0.002), and liberal (OR, 2.609; 95% CI, 1.278–5.328; p = 0.008) groups. Compared with the moderate group of intraoperative colloid infusion rate, the risk for PPCs significantly increased at no colloid (OR, 2.095; 95% CI, 1.193–3.680; p = 0.010) and restrictive (OR, 2.911; 95% CI, 1.443–5.873; p = 0.003) groups.
Conclusions
In patients undergoing minimally invasive lobectomy the infusion rates of intraoperative total fluid and intraoperative colloid were all significantly associated with PPCs. Both restrictive and liberal intraoperative fluid administration were related to adverse effects on postoperative outcomes.}

abstract = {Wind farms are an indispensable driver toward renewable and nonpolluting energy resources. However, as ideal sites are limited, placement in remote and challenging locations results in higher logistics costs and lower average wind speeds. Therefore, it is critical to increase the reliability of the turbines to reduce maintenance costs. Robust implementation requires a thorough understanding of the loads subject to the turbine's control. Yet, such dynamically changing multidimensional loads are uncommon with other machinery, and generally underresearched. Therefore, a multitiered approach is proposed to investigate the load spectrum occurring in wind farms. Our approach relies on both fundamental research using controllable test rigs, as well as analyses of real-world loading conditions in high-frequency supervisory control and data acquisition data. A method is introduced to detect operational zones in wind farm data and link them with load distributions. Additionally, while focused research further investigates the load spectrum, a method is proposed that continuously optimizes the farm's control protocols without the need to fully understand the loads that occur. A case of gearbox failure is investigated based on a vast body of past experiments and suspect loads are identified. Starting from this evidence on the cause and effects of dynamic loads, the potential of our methods is shown by analyzing real-world farm loading conditions on a steady-state case of wake and developing a preventive row-based control protocol for a case of cascading emergency brakes induced by a storm.}

abstract = {Objectives
The aim of this study is to propose an approach for developing trustworthy recommendations as part of urgent responses (1–2 week) in the clinical, public health, and health systems fields.
Study Design and Setting
We conducted a review of the literature, outlined a draft approach, refined the concept through iterative discussions, a workshop by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation Rapid Guidelines project group, and obtained feedback from the larger Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation working group.
Results
A request for developing recommendations within 2 week is the usual trigger for an urgent response. Although the approach builds on the general principles of trustworthy guideline development, we highlight the following steps: (1) assess the level of urgency; (2) assess feasibility; (3) set up the organizational logistics; (4) specify the question(s); (5) collect the information needed; (6) assess the adequacy of identified information; (7) develop the recommendations using one of the 4 potential approaches: adopt existing recommendations, adapt existing recommendations, develop new recommendations using existing adequate systematic review, or develop new recommendations using expert panel input; and (8) consider an updating plan.
Conclusion
An urgent response for developing recommendations requires building a cohesive, skilled, and highly motivated multidisciplinary team with the necessary clinical, scientific, and methodological expertise; adapting to shifting needs; complying with the principles of transparency; and properly managing conflicts of interest.}

abstract = {Purpose
Fiberoptic laryngoscopy (FOL) is a critical tool for the diagnosis, staging, assessment of treatment response, and detection of recurrence for head and neck (H&N) malignancies. No standardized recommendations exist for procedural FOL education in radiation oncology. We therefore implemented a pilot simulation workshop to train radiation oncology residents in pertinent H&N anatomy and FOL technique.
Methods and Materials
A 2-phase workshop and simulation session was designed. Residents initially received a lecture on H&N anatomy and the logistics of the FOL examination. Subsequently, residents had a practical session in which they performed FOL in 2 simulated environments: a computerized FOL program and mannequin-based practice. Site-specific attending physicians were present to provide real-time guidance and education. Pre- and postworkshop surveys were administered to the participants to determine the impact of the workshop. Subsequently, postgraduate year (PGY)-2 residents were required to complete 6 supervised FOL examinations in clinic and were provided immediate feedback.
Results
Annual workshops were performed in 2017 to 2019. The survey completion rate was 14 of 18 (78%). Participants ranged from fourth-year medical students to PGY-2 to PGY-5 residents. All PGY-2 residents completed their 6 supervised FOL examinations. On a 5-point Likert scale, mean H&N anatomy knowledge increased from 2.4 to 3.7 (standard deviation = 0.6, P < .0001). Similarly, mean FOL procedural skill confidence increased from 2.2 to 3.3 (standard deviation = 0.7, P < .0001). These effects were limited to novice (fourth-year medical students to PGY-2) participants. All participants found the exercise clinically informative.
Conclusions
A simulation-based workshop for teaching FOL procedural skills increased confidence and procedural expertise of new radiation oncology residents and translated directly to supervised clinical encounters. Adoption of this type of program may help to improve resident training in H&N cancer.}

In this study, multiple exposure pathways and health risks of children to heavy metal(loid)s were studied based on questionnaire-based surveys and field sampling of soil, dust, fine particulates, drinking water and food. We found that Pb, Cd and Mn levels in environmental samples were very high indicating a serious pollution problem. Inhalation exposure via aerosol particles was the most important pathway and was greater than exposure by food ingestion. The hazard index for Mn via aerosol particles was >1 even at the 5th percentile and Mn levels in urine was 10 times higher than those of people living in typical contaminated areas. The total incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) for all metal(loid)s was also higher than the threshold at the 95th percentile. This study highlights health risks to children living in fourth tier cities and the importance of air pollution control to protect heavy metal exposure for children.}

This study sought to evaluate the acceptability of inactivated influenza vaccine delivered by microneedle patch (MNP) in comparison to inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) delivered by hypodermic needle. Design, Setting, and Participants. From the general population of Atlanta, Georgia, we screened 112 and enrolled 100 healthy adult subjects ages 18 to 49 years. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s). Our participants were randomized to 4 groups of 25 per arm: (1) IIV by MNP administered by healthcare worker (HCW), (2) IIV by MNP self-administered by study participants, (3) IIV by intramuscular (IM) injection administered by HCW or (4) placebo by MNP administered by HCW. We administered four questionnaires: at Day 0 before and after study product delivery, and at Days 8 and 28.
Results
At baseline, 98.6% of participants receiving MNP vaccination reported an overall positive experience with MNPs, compared to 86.4% for participants receiving IM vaccination. For future influenza vaccination, study participants (N = 99) preferred MNP (n = 65, 69.9%) to injections or nasal spray (n = 20, 21.5%), and the preference for MNP increased from Day 0 to Day 28. Factor analyses resulted in two scaled measures including MNP Use Perceptions (a = 0.799, n = 5 items) and MNP Perceived Convenience (a = 0.844, n = 4 items) that were included in longitudinal assessments; while findings reflect significant differences across treatment groups on mean scores for ease of use, MNP perceived protection, MNP reliability, and MNP selection knowledge, all groups reported their belief that influenza vaccination by MNP would be reliable and protective, as well as easy-to-use and convenient.
Conclusions and Relevance
Most participants were accepting of IIV vaccination by MNP and preferred it to injection. Delivery of IIV by MNP may help increase vaccination coverage.}

abstract = {Summary
Introduction
Post-mastectomy breast reconstruction (PMBR) is an important component of the multidisciplinary care of breast cancer patients. Despite the improved quality of life, significant racial disparities exist in the receipt of PMBR. Given the increasing population of Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) women in UK, it is important to address this disparity. Our review aims to identify the barriers and facilitators influencing the uptake of PMBR in BAME women and raise awareness for physicians on interventions that could improve uptake of PMBR in BAME women.
Methods
The methodology outlined by the Cochrane guidelines was used to structure this systematic review. Systematic searches for qualitative studies on barriers and/or facilitators to PMBR in ethnic women published in English were conducted. The following databases were searched from their inception up to June 2019: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar and Scopus. Reference lists of all included articles and relevant systematic reviews were also hand-searched for possible additional publications. Publication year or status restrictions were not applied. Only full text articles published in English and by peer reviewed journals are included. Exclusion criteria were as follows: quantitative studies on barriers and/or facilitators to PMBR, abstracts, conference proceedings, non-English language and non-specific to BAME women. A thematic synthesis approach was used through the development of sub-themes and themes from the findings of the included qualitative studies.
Results
Five studies satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Three overarching themes emerged from our review: physician-associated factors (physician recommendations), patient-associated factors (knowledge, language, community and cultural, emotions, logistics, patient characteristics) and system-associated factors (insurance coverage, income status).
Conclusion
Our systematic review suggests that there is a paucity of data in the literature on the barriers and facilitators to PMBR in BAME women. Considering the expanding population of BAME women and increasing breast cancer incidence, it is imperative that future research in this field is carried out. Physician and patient-associated factors were identified as the most important yet modifiable factors. Adopting a combination of culturally tailored interventions targeting these factors may help improve the access of PMBR in BAME women.

abstract = {Project-based organizations are increasingly becoming dependent on suppliers because of an upward trend of subcontracting and an emphasis on core competencies. Projects can be viewed as complex networks consisting of several interdependent actors, and among them, suppliers are important entities. In project-based firms, the demand of the material supply chain is driven by the material requirement of the project, which is referred to as project-driven supply chains (PDSCs). PDSCs couple off-site supply chain activities (i.e., production, logistics, and inventory) with on-site project activities (i.e., scheduling, resource planning, and allocation), and thus exposure of this integration to any disruption may impede the progress of the project. This study evaluates the resilience capacity of existing suppliers of PDSC. More precisely, the objectives of the study are to determine the factors influencing supplier’s resilience in the context of PDSCs and to compute suppliers’ resilience scores. The factors are identified using published literature and scores are computed using fuzzy linguistic guided order weighted aggregation (FLQ-OWA) technique. The proposed methodology is implemented in a real project case (construction of hospital/health care facility). The computed resilience scores enable activity-wise analysis of supplier’s resilience which in turn, helps in classifying existing suppliers in distinct groups characterized by their resilience capability and providing early warning signals to the top managers of contractor’s organization to work proactively with all corrective measures planned at the onset of the project.}

This research aims to identify and characterise different types of business models that create value from agricultural waste and by-products via cascading or closing loops. Conceptual and management insights into circular business models are still sparse. In total, 39 cases have been studied that convert agro-waste and by-products into valuable products via a circular economy approach. Semi-structured interviews and on-site visits of six representative cases have been done, and secondary data been collected. Data has been treated with content analysis. Cases are presented according to the type of organisational structure, resources, transformation processes, value propositions, key partners, customers, strategic approaches and innovation. Six types of circular business models are identified and discussed: biogas plant, upcycling entrepreneurship, environmental biorefinery, agricultural cooperative, agropark and support structure. They differ in their way of value creation and organisational form, but strongly depend on partnerships and their capacity to respond to changing external conditions. This study offers the first circular business model typology within the agricultural domain, revealing the interconnectedness of the six different business model types. It provides options for managers in positioning and adapting their business strategies. It highlights the potential of using biomass first for higher added-value products before exploiting it as energy source. Cascading biomass valorisation at a territorial level will increasingly be important for locally cooperating actors within a circular bioeconomy approach.}

Simulation is a good support tool for this type of decisions because it allows reproducing processes virtually to study their behavior, to analyze the impact of possible changes or to compare different design alternatives without the high cost of scale experiments. Although process simulation is usually focused on industrial processes, over the last two decades, new proposals have emerged to bring simulation techniques into software engineering. This paper describes a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) which returned 8070 papers (published from 2013 to 2019) by a systematic search in 4 digital libraries. After conducting this SLR, 36 Software Process Simulation Modeling (SPSM) works were selected as primary studies and were documented following a specific characterization scheme. This scheme allows characterizing each proposal according to the paradigm used and its technology base as well as its future line of work. Our purpose is to identify trends and directions for future research on SPSM after identifying and studying which proposals in this topic have been defined and the relationships and dependencies between these proposals in the last five years. After finishing this review, it is possible to conclude that SPSM continues to be a topic that is very much addressed by the scientific community, but each contribution has been proposed with particular goals. This review also concludes that Agent-Based Simulation and System Dynamics paradigm is increasing and decreasing, respectively, its trend among SPSM proposals in the last five years. Regarding Discrete-Event Simulation paradigm, it seems that it is strengthening its position among research community in recent years to design new approaches.}

However, several difficulties are attributed to possibilities of practical exploitation of ash and biochar due to the transporting, handling and mode of application. Granulation of energy generation waste has been shown in some circumstances as a cost-effective and environmentally friendly method. Production of granules (pellets) from wood ash and biochar leads to improved recycling and logistics of waste as well as helps to control and avoid undesirable environmental effects such as leaching of nutrient excess. The aim of this study was to prepare granules from wood fly ash and biochar mixed with organic-rich freshwater lake sediments (sapropel) used as a natural binder and a source of organic matter for enrichment of derived granules to be applicable as a soil improver. Characterization of raw materials and derived granules included range of physical and chemical analysis. Applied granulation technology involved homogenization of components following by extrusion and drum granulation, and the process was developed for prospective production of soil improvers. It was estimated that the most optimal mass ratio of raw materials applicable for the process of granulation is 67:100 (fly ash to sapropel) and 30:100 (biochar to sapropel) resulting in production of granules 3–8 mm in diameter. Among the characteristic parameters of granules apparent density, bulk density, compressive strength, total element content and element content by fractions was assessed.}

In underground mines, the use of diesel-powered machinery has been increased in the past decades. The combustion of diesel fuel produces a great quantity of pollutants (i.e. gas emissions, particulate matter, etc.). Thus, a constant ventilation is required to satisfy the regulations on health and safety of miners. One of the innovative transformations that underground mining processes have adopted is the use of electrical Load Haul Dumps (LHDs) to reduce the in-mine emissions and the ventilation burden and to improve in-mine working conditions, among other benefits. Electric mobile LHDs could be further improved by replacing battery-based energy supplies with hydrogen fuel cells. The present work focuses on the techno-economic assessment of modifying electrical LHDs by incorporating different processes and equipment (i.e. fuel cell stacks, storage tanks, DC/DC converters). The base case considers the modification of the whole mining fleet of diesel-based LHDs. As a result, a positive Net Present Value (for the project time span under consideration) and a payback period of 7.78 years were observed. The sensitivity analysis showed that considerable modifications of the current states of diesel price are required so that modifications are not feasible (diesel prices of 0.53 €/l). A tight electricity cost of 70 €/MWh was obtained as a breaking point (considerably safe for several industrial conditions).}

abstract = {Background
Optimal strategies for prevention and treatment for post-stroke depression (PSD) remain unclear and a greater understanding of effect of resilience on PSD is promising. The aim was to examine the association between baseline resilience and depression at 1, 3, and 6 months after discharge, which contributes to early detection and management of PSD.
Methods
A total of 217 ischemic stroke survivors were recruited in two tertiary hospitals in Shanghai, China from February 2017 to January 2018. The Chinese version of Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) was used to assess resilience at acute hospitalization. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was employed to ascertain baseline anxiety, baseline depression, and post-discharge depression. Social-demographic and disease-related information were obtained from participants’ self-report and medical records. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine which factors were independently associated with PSD.
Results
The prevalence of depression at baseline was 21.2% and at 1, 3, and 6 months after discharge was 34.4%, 33.2%, and 29.2%, respectively. Logistics regression analyses indicated that resilience may independently predict PSD at 1 month (OR: 0.22, 95%CI: 0.097, 0.518), 3 months (OR:0.302, 95%CI: 0.151, 0.607), and 6 months (OR: 0.03, 95%CI: 0.006, 0.153) after controlling for social-demographics, disease-related characteristics, baseline anxiety, and baseline depression.
Limitations
Non-multicenter survey and mild stroke severity may affect the generalization of these findings. Moreover, response bias should be acknowledged because some participants were read questionnaires out aloud.
Conclusion
Resilience is independently associated with PSD at different timepoints. Our findings reveal the important role of resilience as a protective factor against PSD.}

As this virus spread rapidly, it became a matter of time before many countries began to implement measures to try and contain the spread of the disease. COVID-19 as it is referred to, resulted in two main approaches to fighting the viral pandemic, either through a progressive set of measures to slow down the number of identified cases designed to ‘flatten the curve’ over time (anticipated to be at least six months), or to attack it by the severest of measures including a total lock-down and/or herding exposure to fast track ‘immunisation’ while we await a vaccine. The paper reports the findings from the first phase of an ongoing survey designed to identify the changing patterns in travel activity of Australian residents as a result of the stage 2 restrictions imposed by the Australian government. The main restrictions, in addition to social distancing of at least 1.5 m, are closure of entry to Australia (except residents returning), and closure of non-essential venues such as night clubs, restaurants, mass attendee sporting events, churches, weddings, and all social gatherings in any circumstance. With some employers encouraging working from home and others requiring it, in addition to job losses, and many children attending school online from home, the implications on travel activity is extreme. We identify the initial impacts associated with the first month of stricter social distancing measures introduced in Australia.}

abstract = {Background The Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic. Acute respiratory compromise and systemic coagulopathy cause significant morbidity and mortality. Venous thromboembolism (VTE), which encompasses both deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), as well as arterial thromboembolism (ATE), which includes stroke, are common sequelae described in this patient population. COVID-19 coagulopathy is attributed to severe inflammation and endothelial dysfunction resulting in a prothrombotic state. COVID-19 related treatment has focused on targeting the unregulated inflammatory state in an attempt to decrease incidence of COVID-19 related complications, such as thrombosis. Prophylactic anticoagulation is recommended, and many suggest intermediate to therapeutic anticoagulation in severe COVID-19. However, there is no clear data showing impact of anticoagulation on morbidity and mortality in patients with COVID-19. Methods A retrospective analysis was performed on all COVID-19 patients hospitalized between March 2020 and June 2020 at our institution. Patient charts were individually reviewed to ensure accuracy of data. Thromboembolic events (VTE or ATE) verified by imaging were included in the analysis. The impact of COVID-19 specific treatments such as Remdesivir, Tocilizumab, Hydroxychloroquine, and steroids on incidence of thrombosis was analyzed by using X2 testing. Using logistics regression, we analyzed the effect of prophylactic versus therapeutic anticoagulation received before development of thrombosis on mortality. Results Out of 1265 COVID-19 positive hospitalized patients during our time frame, 138 (10.9%) had thromboembolism. Incidence of 6.3% VTE, 5.6% DVT, 4.8% PE in COVID-19 patients was significantly higher than 0.24% VTE, 0.15% DVT, 0.12% PE in non COVID-19 hospitalized patients as reported by CDC (p<.0001 for all). Amongst patients with COVID-19, mortality for patients with thrombosis is significantly higher than patients without thrombosis (31.9% vs. 10%, p<0.001). Hispanic patients had a significantly higher mortality rate of 51% compared to African American 18%, other 29%, or Caucasian 20% (p=0.0020). Patients with PE had a significantly higher mortality rate than patients with non-pulmonary thrombotic events (18.0% vs. 13.7%, p=0.0412).The incidence of thrombosis was significantly less in those who received steroids at 14% as compared to other COVID-19 treatment: Tocilizumab 25% (p=0.0031), Hydroxychloroquine 42% (p<.0001), and Remdesivir 72% (p<.0001). Adjusting for gender, age, race, BMI, the mortality rate in COVID-19 patients with thrombosis was higher in patients who had COVID-19 related treatment compared to without treatment: Remdesivir OR (4.67, 95% CI 1.43- 15.2), steroids OR (4.52, 95% CI 1.82- 11.18), Tocilizumab OR (2.51, 95% CI 1.06-5.96), and Hydroxychloroquine OR (1.54, 95% CI .661- 3.59). There was no difference in mortality in patients who had prophylactic enoxaparin 40.5% compared to therapeutic enoxaparin 51.7% (p= 0.3491) (Figure 1). Adjusting for all demographics, a logistics model showed βprophylaxis anticoagulation= βTherapeutic anticoagulation showing no mortality difference in patients who had either dosing of anticoagulation (difference=0.2658, Z=.55, p=0.5810). Conclusion In Our study the incidence of thrombosis in hospitalized COVID-19 patients was significantly higher than non-COVID-19 hospitalized patients. COVID-19 patients with thrombosis had higher mortality compared to COVID-19 patient without thrombosis, particularly patients with PE. Hispanic patients with COVID-19 and thrombosis experienced a higher mortality rate compared to non-Hispanic patients. The lowest incidence of thrombosis occurred in COVID-19 patients who received steroids, followed by Tocilizumab suggesting that steroids and Tocilizumab may reduce the pro-inflammatory state leading to thrombosis. However, mortality rate was higher in patients who received COVID-19 related treatment, suggesting that these patients likely had severe disease. There was no mortality difference in patients who received prophylactic versus therapeutic anticoagulation prior to thrombosis. Randomized control trials will address the impact of anticoagulation dosing on morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients and study the post discharge prophylaxis and long-term outcomes in these patients.

abstract = {Tracer technology has gained considerable attention recently as an effective tool in the reservoir monitoring and surveillance toolkit, particularly in improved oil recovery (IOR) operations. Gas flow paths within the reservoir can be quite different from liquid (oil and water) flow paths. This is primarily due to gravity override, and differences in density and relative permeability between the gas and liquid phases. An Inter Well Gas Tracer Test (IWGTT) is a key monitoring and surveillance tool for any IOR projects. IWGTT should be designed and implemented to track the flow behavior of gas phase. The test generally entails injecting a small amount of unique perflouro-hydrocarbon tracers into the gas phase injectant stream. IWGTT have been conducted on a limited number of fields across the globe, and sample results of some will be presented. The sampling frequency of the tracers from the producers should be designed carefully to collect the necessary data that will provide insights about the connectivity between the injectors and producers well pairs, gas breakthrough times (“time of flight”), and possible interwell fluid saturations. Different fit-for-purpose unique tracers can be deployed in the subject injector(s) stream and their elution can be monitored in the corresponding up-dip producer(s). In addition to reservoir connectivity and breakthrough times between injector and producer pairs, an IWGTT helps in optimizing water altering gas (WAG) operations and production strategies for gas injection projects, improve sweep efficiency and ultimately enhance oil recovery. It can also be used to identify source of inadvertent gas leakage into shallow aquifers or soil gas, and help in the planning and placement of future wells. This paper reviews the workflow and necessary logistics for the successful deployment of an interwell gas tracer test. It will provide the best practices for designing, sampling, analyzing and interpreting a gas tracer deployment. The paper also highlights the benefits of gas tracer data and their usefulness in understanding well interconnectivity and dynamic fluid flow in the reservoir. The results can be used to refine the reservoir simulation model and fine-tune its parameters. This effort should lead to better reservoir description and an improved dynamic simulation model. The challenges associated with IWGTT will also be shared.}

abstract = {Objectives
To assess the diagnostic performance of rapid lateral flow immunochromatographic assays (LFAs) compared with an ELISA and nucleic acid amplification tests (NATs) in individuals with suspected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Methods
Patients presenting to a Dutch teaching hospital were eligible between 17 March and 10 April 2020, when they had respiratory symptoms that were suspected for COVID-19. The performances of six different LFAs were evaluated in plasma samples obtained on corresponding respiratory sample dates of NATs testing. Subsequently, the best performing LFA was evaluated in 228 patients and in 50 sera of a historical patient control group.
Results
In the pilot analysis, sensitivity characteristics of LFA were heterogeneous, ranging from 2/20 (10%; 95% CI 0%–23%) to 11/20 (55%; 95% CI 33%–77%). In the total cohort, Orient Gene Biotech COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test LFA had a sensitivity of 43/99 (43%; 95% CI 34%–53%) and specificity of 126/129 (98%; 95% CI 95%–100%). Sensitivity increased to 31/52 (60%; 95% CI 46%–73%) in patients with at least 7 days of symptoms, and to 21/33 (64%; 95% CI 47%–80%) in patients with C-reactive protein (CRP) ≥100 mg/L. Sensitivity and specificity of Wantai SARS-CoV-2 Ab ELISA was 59/95 (62%; 95% CI 52%–72%) and 125/128 (98%; 95% CI 95%–100%) in all patients, respectively, but sensitivity increased to 38/48 (79%; 95% CI 68%–91%) in patients with at least 7 days of symptoms.
Conclusions
There is large variability in diagnostic test performance between rapid LFAs, but overall limited sensitivity and high specificity in acutely admitted patients. Sensitivity improved in patients with longer existing symptoms or high CRP. LFAs should only be considered as additional triage tools when these may lead to the improvement of hospital logistics.}

abstract = {A new model and solution for the multi-objective heterogeneous vehicle routing and scheduling problem, with energy minimizing, is presented in this paper. The concept of heterogeneities is concerned with the ownership of fleets. Ownership heterogeneities occur when the private fleet is not sufficient and the company has to rent some vehicles from external carriers to complete the shipments. A new mathematical formulation for vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW) is also presented using the proposed concept of heterogeneities. Moreover, unlike prior attempts to minimize cost by minimizing overall traveling distance, the model also incorporates energy minimizing which meets the latest requirements of green logistics. This paper considers the customers' priority for servicing as well. The proposed model is interpreted as multi-objective optimization and used in two scenarios where, in the first scenario (I), the energy consumed and the total number of vehicles are minimized and the total satisfaction rate of customers is maximized. In the second scenario (II) the distance traveled by the vehicles, the total number of rental vehicles and the fuel consumed by the private vehicles are minimized and the total satisfaction is maximized. A new solution based on an evolutionary algorithm is proposed and its performance on several completely random instances is compared to the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA II) and CPLEX Solver. The efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach is further demonstrated through several computational experiments.}

abstract = {Background
Infections are a feared complication following primary total elbow arthroplasty (TEA). Studies comparing baseline demographic profiles and identifying risk factors associated with developing surgical site infections (SSIs) or peri-prosthetic joint infections (PJIs), following primary TEA are limited. This study was therefore aimed to: (1) compare patient demographics; and (2) identify patient-related risk factors for the development of infections following a primary TEA.
Methods
Patients who underwent primary TEA from January 1, 2005 to March 31, 2014 were identified in an administrative claims database. The study group consisted of all patients who developed either SSIs within 90-days or PJIs within 2-years following the index procedure, respectively. A total of 23,134 primary TEAs were identified between 2005 and 2014, of which 757 (3.3%) were coded as being infected. Primary outcomes that were assessed included comparing baseline patient demographics and identifying patient-related risk factors for developing PJIs. Pearson's chi-square analyses were used to compare study group demographics to their counterparts. Welch's t-test was used to compare mean Elixhauser-Comorbidity Index scores between the cohorts. Multivariate binomial logistics regression was used to calculate odds-ratios (OR) for patient-related risk factors. A P value less than .05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Patients who developed infections were significantly different compared to their counterparts with respect to the variables analyzed. Patients developing infections were found to have a higher prevalence of comorbidities as measured by mean Elixhauser-Comorbidity Index scores in patients who developed SSIs (7 vs. 5, P < .0001) or PJIs (7 vs. 5, P < .0001) compared to their respective counterparts. The greatest risk factors for SSIs within 90-days following primary TEA were rheumatoid arthritis (OR: 1.80, P < .0001), being male (OR: 1.53, P = .009), and depressive disorders (OR: 1.52, P = .004), whereas iron deficiency anemia (OR: 2.04, P < .0001), rheumatoid arthritis (OR: 1.78, P < .0001), and pathologic weight loss (OR: 1.73, P < .0001) were associated with an increased odd of PJIs.
Conclusion
This study demonstrated statistically significant differences between patients who developed and did not develop infections following primary TEA and identified a myriad of risk factors associated with these adverse events. The results from this study can help identify high risk patients by orthopedic surgeon in order to potentially mitigate the incidence of either SSIs or PJIs in patients undergoing TEA.

It is essential to monitor the island urban expansion to support sustainable policy making for ecological conservation and environmental management. However, current methods developed for mainland have limitations in capturing the annual urban expansion from land reclamation on islands. Besides, differences of urban expansion among various island development types remain unclear. This study developed an efficient framework on the Google Earth Engine platform for mapping annual urban dynamics in island regions using long-term time series of Landsat, by integrating coastal dynamic mapping approach, random forest classifier, and time-series change detection method. We implemented the developed framework in Zhoushan Archipelago, the largest archipelago in China that contains different island development types. The mapped urban areas and their conversion sources were reliable with overall accuracies over 90%. The overall accuracy of urbanized years was 86% using the one-year tolerance strategy. The total urban area expanded from 97 ± 24 km2 to 438 ± 34 km2 during 1986–2017, at the cost of 148 ± 24 km2 agricultural land, 138 ± 14 km2 water body, 41 ± 13 km2 forest and 14 ± 8 km2 tidal flat. The urban growth accelerated since 2004 driven by a series of government policies, as well as the growth of the population and socio-economy. Moreover, most urban expansion was concentrated in islands with comprehensive development type (65%), followed by the islands with harbor and logistics (15%), coastal tourism (10%), coastal industry (8%), scientific fishery (1%) and marine science and education (1%). The speed and scale of future urban expansion will play an important role for island sustainability. The proposed framework is transferable in other regions for a better understanding of the long-term island urban dynamics at large scales.}

abstract = {Summary of Objectives
Almost half of the lung transplantations (LTx) in the Netherlands are performed with donation after circulatory death (DCD) donors. However, over 25% of DCD procedures are cancelled because excessive length of the agonal phase: >120 minutes. Indeed, in 2017 4/20 and in 2018 4/19 suitable DCD lung procedures in our center were cancelled due to a prolonged agonal phase. Pig models have shown that a prolonged agonal phase does not compromise lung quality. Due to the possibility to test lungs by EVLP the length of the agonal phase might be even less important in DCD LTx. We therefore composed a protocol of DCD LTx irrespective of length of the agonal phase and present the first LTx using this protocol (fig 1).
Methods
Informed consent is obtained from patients on the LTx waiting list from our center to receive extended DCD (eDCD) lungs. All suitable DCD lung donors from our center are included. When a donor exceeds the 2 hour agonal phase limit for regular DCD donation, the eDCD protocol starts and donation is limited to the lungs. When a donor passes away, after five minutes ‘no touch’, the donor is transported to the operating theater for intubation. Lungs are ventilated and procured <3 hours. Ventilation is done according to Dutch DCD guidelines. All eDCD lungs are evaluated with EVLP. If suitable, according to the EVLP protocol, the lungs are transplanted.
Endpoints
Using our eDCD protocol, on the deadline date of abstract submission, we performed our first extended DCD LTx. The agonal phase was almost 3 hours. We propose to present the results of this and future eDCD LTx and discuss the benefits, difficulties and logistics of eDCD at the ISHLT at Montreal 2020.}

To adapt a successful outpatient rehabilitation program targeting the prevention of mobility decline among older adults for the post-acute nursing home setting within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) using the Replicating Effective Programs (REP) Framework.
Design
Program development.
Setting
Community Living Center (CLC), the post-acute nursing home setting within VHA.
Participants
Veterans receiving post-acute CLC rehabilitative care.
Interventions
We used the REP framework to guide adaptation of the Live Long Walk Strong (LLWS) program for the CLC setting. The original LLWS program treats physiologic impairments associated with mobility decline, promotes behavior change, and links patients to physical activity programs to foster long-term maintenance of health and function. LLWS produces large clinically meaningful improvements in mobility when implemented as an outpatient program for community-dwelling older adults. We adapted the program for the CLC by working through the phases of the REP framework. In the Pre-conditions phase, we identified local champions, developed an understanding of CLC processes, and identified existing resources. In the Pre-implementation phase, we engaged a broader group of stakeholders (CLC providers, CLC administrators, home health agencies), addressed electronic health record logistics, and trained staff. In the Implementation phase, we completed Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles and refined the protocol.
Main Outcome Measures
Preliminary feasibility.
Results
The adapted version of LLWS includes novel elements and bridges the inpatient CLC stay and subsequent three months post-discharge. The inpatient component focuses on maximizing functional recovery and includes activities focused on timing and coordination of gait, lower extremity strength and power, and trunk muscle endurance. The care transition and virtual (i.e., telehealth) post-discharge components focus on case management and engagement in physical activity programs. Coaching and behavior change are a consistent focus throughout the program. The adapted program is being rolled out as a clinical demonstration project and demonstrates preliminary feasibility.
Conclusions
The REP framework provides a useful guide for adapting rehabilitative programs to meet the needs of new populations.

abstract = {Background
Carotid atherosclerosis (CA) can reflect atherosclerotic status of systemic vessels, and is associated with ischemic stroke and cognitive impairment. Milk consumption is growing in China, and data are limited on the association between milk and CA risk.
Methods
Participants aged ≥40 years in China National Stroke Prevention Project were recruited for carotid ultrasound examination, and those with carotid endarterectomy, carotid stenting stroke or coronary heart disease were excluded. Participants were defined as having CA when intima–media thickness (IMT) ≥1 mm or plaques were detected by ultrasonography. For milk consumption, though contents were not analyzed, people were divided into high consumption (≥200 ml/day and ≥5 day/week) and low consumption (occasional or never) groups. Multivariate logistics regression analyses were done in both full and propensity score-matched population to identify the association between milk consumption and CA.
Results
84880 participants were included in the final analysis. After being adjusted by age, gender, living location, smoking habits, drinking habits, physical activity, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia, high milk consumption is associated with CA in both full population (odds ratio [OR] = 1.26, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.19–1.33) and propensity score-matched population (OR = 1.25, 95%CI 1.17–1.34). High milk consumption is also a risk factor for IMT thickening (OR = 1.15, 95%CI 1.08–1.23), carotid plaque formation (OR = 1.17, 95%CI 1.09–1.25) and carotid stenosis over 50% (OR = 1.52, 95%CI 1.10–2.14) in the propensity score-matched population.
Conclusions
High milk consumption is related to CA in middle and old-aged Chinese population. More cautious advice on milk intake should be given in this population for prevention of atherosclerosis.}

The knowledge of antivenom dosage, mode of administration, availability, and logistics is essential to the healthcare practitioners (HCPs) in the management of snakebites. It is vital for the HCPs involved in the handling of ASVs to have its basic knowledge. The ASV contains proteins and can, therefore, easily get denatured if not handled appropriately, leading to poor therapeutic outcome. It is also essential for clinicians to be aware of the tendency of ASV to cause a severe life-threatening hypersensitivity reaction. There is currently no validated tool for assessing the knowledge of ASV among HCPs. Therefore, we developed and validated a tool for evaluating the HCPs knowledge of ASV. The items included in the tool were first generated from a comprehensive literature review. Face validity were conducted by presenting the drafted tool to ten experts on the subject matter. A validation study was conducted among doctors, pharmacists, nurses, pharmacy technicians, and the general public. The objectives of the study were to test the tool for content validity using the content validity index (CVI), construct validity using contrast group approach, difficulty index, readability, and reliability test using the test-retest method. We developed and validated a final tool containing thirty-three items. The tool was valid for face validity and had a scale-level (average) content validity (S-CVI/Ave) of 0.91. The ASV knowledge of pharmacists was higher than that of doctors, pharmacy technicians, nurses, and the general public (p < 0.001), thus, valid for construct validity. The readability of the tool using the Simple Measure of Gobbledygook (SMOG) was determined to be grade level 7. The test-retest analysis showed no significant difference between the mean knowledge scores measured at four weeks interval (p = 0.916), implying excellent reliability. The AKAT has demonstrated good psychometrical properties that would enable its application among a wide range of healthcare practitioners.}

In the first stage, it works to optimize the locations of Points of Distribution (PODs), medical supply levels, and transportation capacity, and in the second, transportation decisions or flow. Our model minimizes the total social cost, comprised of deprivation and commercial logistics costs. Contrary to the extant literature, which typically employs robust optimization, we use probability distributions to avoid overly conservative estimates of hurricane impact. Additionally, our model facilitates the determination of optimal deployment time. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach in a case study. As risk attitude goes from optimistic to pessimistic, decision makers increase the number of PODs exponentially to spread the risk around. A similar trend holds for total costs as a function of hurricane category and its interplay with risk. Further, for lower strength hurricanes, regardless of risk attitude, the optimal decision is to deploy closer to landfall at 12 hours; for higher strength hurricanes, resources are best deployed earlier, at 36 hours, based on an exponential increase in demand for medical supplies. Deployment cost also increases exponentially as landfall approaches. These costs outweigh deprivation savings from an accurate demand estimate closer to landfall. However, when budget is limited, risk attitude is found to influence deployment decisions and a funding preference for lower severity-level supplies.}

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread over the world and has heightened concerns over global food security risks. As the first country hit by COVID-19, China has adopted a series of stringent mitigation policies to contain the spread of virus. This has led to food system disruptions due to restrictions on labor and interruption of transport, processing, retailing, and input distribution.
OBJECTIVE
The objective of this contribution is to report evidence for initial impacts and resilience of China's food system amid the COVID-19 pandemic and to discuss government's responses as well as long-term efforts that promoted resilience.
METHODS
We reviewed a range of publications, government released reports and official information, blogs, and media articles, and whenever possible, we complemented this qualitative information with quantitative data from China's National Bureau of Statistics and finally empirical data obtained from a simulation study.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
We identified China's earlier responses in each key food system activities including ensuring effective logistics of agricultural products and inputs, supporting production and processing, matching supply with demand, and mitigating consumer's income loss. In particular, innovative information and communications technology (ICT) applications along the food system had been highlighted. Coupled with China's long-term efforts in investing in agriculture, building emergency response systems, and adopting governor's responsibility mechanisms, there has been little panic in the food system with largely sufficient supplies and stable prices. In the second quarter of 2020, after registered negative growth in the first quarter, primary agriculture grew by 3.4% and the negative growth of livestock production was narrowed significantly by 8.7 percentage points. Food prices rose by a modest 0.6% and returned to normal after a surge in February 2020.
SIGNIFICANCE
We expect that China's experiences on building resilient food systems could improve understanding of the challenges posed by COVID-19 from a retrospective perspective and provide lessons to other countries that are experiencing disruptions in the food systems worldwide. The lessons are also important for strengthening the resilience of food systems over longer time horizons.}

abstract = {Aim
Symptomatic tracheobronchomalacia can be fatal. Successful treatment includes aortopexy. We report outcomes of the thoracoscopic approach in a single centre.
Methods
All patients undergoing thoracoscopic aortopexies from 2009 to 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. Data was reported as median (interquartile range). Risk factors for subsequent tracheostomy were analyzed with logistics regression model, p < 0.05 as significant.
Results
Twenty-one patients with mid to distal tracheomalacia (n = 17) and bronchial involvement (n = 4) were determined on bronchoscopy, tracheobronchogram, or CT thorax. Preoperative patient demographics and comorbidities, e.g., gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, prematurity, and cardiac anomalies were recorded. Indications for thoracoscopic aortopexy were apparent life-threatening event(s) (n = 14), recurrent chest infections (n = 5), and failure to wean invasive ventilation (n = 2). Thoracoscopic aortopexies (n = 20) with conversion to open (n = 1) were performed. Intraoperative bleeding (n = 2) occurred, and chest tube (n = 1) was inserted for monitoring. Intraoperative bronchoscopy (n = 17) confirmed improvement of tracheomalacia. Anesthetic time was 140 (90–160) minutes. Postoperatively, 2 patients had dehiscence of the aorta from the sternum. They underwent redo open aortopexy with posterior tracheopexy, and 1 required subsequent tracheostomy. Another 2 patients required tracheostomies. Potential risk factors for subsequent tracheostomy were investigated, and only the association of tracheobronchomalacia was close to significance (OR 16 (95% CI 0.95–267.03), p = 0.05). Follow up duration was 365 (72–854) days. Symptoms resolution occurred in n = 17 (81%) of patients.
Conclusion
Different modalities were used to delineate the site of tracheobronchomalacia and its etiology. Tracheomalacia with bronchial involvement may be a risk factor for subsequent tracheostomy.

abstract = {Evidence suggests that manufacturing companies have tried to address the current environmental challenges derived from their operations by implementing various operational environmental sustainability approaches, including green manufacturing (GM), cleaner production (CP), green lean (GL), green supply chain management (GSCM), reverse logistics (RLs) and circular economy (CE). However, although their adoption is well documented in developed nations and few other countries, very little has been done to understand such phenomenon in a rapid developing country such as Thailand. This paper aims at filling this gap by providing light into some fundamental issues regarding the implementation of these approaches in the manufacturing sector of Thailand. A survey-based exploratory research was carried out based on 287 Thai manufacturing companies. The data was analysed using a combination of descriptive and inferential statics. The study revealed that a large amount of investment capacity, and proper training & knowledge are needed to fully implement the studied operational approaches. This resulted in some of the weakest elements of Thai manufacturing firms and hence the main barriers to their implementation. The study also showed that Thai manufacturing firms consider the impact on the environment and benefits from adopting these operational approaches as company's policy and own initiative, environmental awareness, and cost saving from conservation of energy as the main reasons for adopting the studied operational approaches. Finally, the findings also indicate that Thai manufacturing firms tend to implement them because of internal factors and that they lack of motivation from external factors and involvement from other stakeholders. The paper extends the current limited knowledge on the deployment of operational environmental sustainability approaches in Asia, and its results can be beneficial for organisations that aim at effectively adopting them to improve their operation's sustainability.}

After the natural adsorption process, the Tm and Ts of the 1-dodecanol-tetradecane/EG composite PCM with an optimal mass ratio of 93:7 are 3.63 °C and 7.71 °C, respectively, while the corresponding Hm and Hs decrease to 197.95 J/g and 198.81 J/g, respectively. Notably, the λ values of the nanofluids and the 1-dodecanol-tetradecane/EG composite PCM are 0.2186 W/(m∙K) and 2.4070 W/(m∙K), respectively, thereby indicating a tenfold increase in λ.

Due to extremely complex logistics required to reach the massif, the genesis of these depressions and of the underlying caves has never been studied in detail. The lack of field campaigns and extended data has fostered a decade-long scientific debate on whether their origin was due to epigenic or hypogenic processes. This study integrates petrological, structural and hydrochemical observations, including analyses of silica concentration, pH, conductivity of surface and cave waters (EC), to investigate the speleogenetic processes acting underground. Petrographic and compositional analyses of the host rock (Matauí Formation) show that in the Sarisariñama region quartz sandstones are regularly characterized by clay interlayers with significant content of pyrophyllite and kaolinite and minor amount of iron hydroxides. Compared to surface waters, subsurface infiltration along vertical fractures and fault planes show enrichment in silica, higher pH and lower EC, confirming that chemical weathering is effective underground provoking intergranular silica dissolution along structural discontinuities. The weathering of the clay and iron hydroxide interlayers guides the speleogenesis, weakening specific stratigraphic levels and causing the collapse and fragmentation of the more resistant quartz sandstone strata. The initial void, created by piping of the loose sand released by quartz sandstone weathering, can migrate upwards by means of roof and wall breakdown; this chain of events eventually triggers a collapse at the surface, which generates a circular or squared sinkhole. The weathering acts mainly along the dominant fracture networks, showing a clear guidance by regional tectonics. These speleogenetic controls rule out the hypothesis of a hypogenic origin of the simas, suggesting a primary role of long-term epigenic chemical weathering and mechanical erosion guided by joints, weak clay and iron hydroxide interlayers, followed by subsequent massive collapses.}

Background & aims
Children on home parenteral nutrition and their parents not only engage with complex nutritional issues but also have to manage difficult social and financial problems with social and clinical support that may not always meet their needs. Baxter's HPN-QOL questionnaire, assesses the QOL of adult patients treated with HPN, and has been developed rigorously using standard guidelines, measuring various dimensions of QOL. Our aim was to use this tool to explore how HPN influences the QOL of paediatric patients.
Methods
The HPN-QOL questionnaire was modified to suit a paediatric HPN population. Data on demographics, aetiology of intestinal failure and duration of HPN were collected from a departmental database. Quality-of-Life grading of functional and symptom scales, HPN specific items and overall QOL Numerical Rating Scales were determined.
Results
Fourteen out of 17 families returned the completed questionnaires. QOL was significantly impaired by increased dependency regarding items of daily living such as eating, dressing, washing, and mobility, but was not affected in the domains of school attendance, general fatigue, pain and body image. There were no significant differences in QOL when patients with and without enterostomy were compared. Patients felt well supported by the hospital nutrition team in managing logistics related to HPN.
Conclusions
QOL in HPN patients was not significantly affected by the medical aspects of care. This descriptive study highlights the need for further integration of medical and social care in order to support families of children receiving HPN as QOL was impaired in relation to activities of daily living and social functioning.}

In most of them, the inflammatory process of respiratory allergies involves the participation of type 2 cytokines, derived from T helper-2 (Th2)-cell, and Group 2 Innate Lymphoid (ILC2) Cells. An efficient memory Th2 cell response is dependent on IL-13 produced by ILC2s, causing allergic lung inflammation and elevated serum levels of immunoglobulin E. ILC2 cells are derived from common lymphoid progenitors and their growing depends on the transcription factor RORA. The aim of this work was to identify genetic variants in RORA associated with asthma phenotypes and allergy markers. Genomic DNA samples of 1246 individuals participating from Social Changes Asthma and Allergy in Latin America Program (SCAALA) have been genotyped using Illumina Human 2.5 Omni Beadchip. Logistics regressions have been performed to analyze the association among RORA variants and asthma, skin prick tests (SPT), specific IgE and type 2 cytokine production. Twelve single nucleotide variants (SNVs) were significantly associated with atopy (P < 0.01), in which four of them, rs10162630, rs17191519, rs17270243, and rs55796775 and their haplotypes were strongly and positively associated (P < 0.001). Furthermore, these variants increased the RORA gene expression in silico analysis. Other SNVs in RORA were associated with allergy markers, atopic and non-atopic asthma. Therefore, it is believed that variants in RORA gene may influence immunologic features of asthma and allergies and could be possible targets for future treatment of allergic diseases.}

The production and recycling of shared bicycles are a closed logistics network, which can be considered a typical closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) problem. In practice, the CLSC network is influenced by social, economic and environmental factors, which impose high degrees of uncertainty and usually trigger various unanticipated risks, so controlling uncertain parameters becomes a key issue in supply chain decisions. The purpose of this research is to construct a new distributionally robust optimization model for a multi-product, multi-echelon CLSC network, in which the distributions of uncertain transportation cost, demand and the returned product are only partially known in advance. In the proposed model, robust mean-CVaR optimization formulation is employed as the objective function for a trade-off between the expected cost and the risk in the CLSC network. Further, to overcome the obstacle of model solvability resulting from imprecise probability distributions, two kinds of ambiguity sets are used to transform the robust counterpart into its computationally tractable forms. Finally, a case study on a Chinese bicycle-sharing company is addressed to validate the proposed robust optimization model. A comparison study is conducted on the performance between our robust optimization method and the traditional optimization method. In addition, a sensitivity analysis is performed with respect to the risk aversion parameter and the confidence level.}

abstract = {Purpose
Genomic analysis of individual patients is now affordable, and therapies targeting specific molecular aberrations are being tested in clinical trials. Genomically-informed therapy is relevant to many clinical domains, but is particularly applicable to cancer treatment. However, even specialized clinicians need help to interpret genomic data, to navigate the complicated space of clinical trials, and to keep up with the rapidly expanding biomedical literature. To quantitate the cognitive load on treating clinicians, we attempt to quantitate the rate of change in potential treatment options for patients considering genomically-relevant and genomically-selected therapy for cancer.
Materials and methods
To this end, we analyzed patient-specific reports generated by a precision oncology decision support team (PODS) at a large academic cancer center. Two types of potential treatment options were analyzed: FDA-approved genomically-relevant and genomically-selected therapies and therapies available via clinical trials. We focused on two clinically-actionable alterations: ERBB2 (Her2/neu; amplified vs. non-amplified) and BRAF mutation (V600 vs. non-V600). To determine changes in available treatment options, we grouped patients into similar groups by disease site (ERBB2: breast, gastric and “other”; BRAF: melanoma, non-melanoma).
Results
A total of 2927 reports for 2366 unique patients were generated 8/2016-12/2018. Reports included 9902 gene variants and 150 disease classifications. BRAF mutation and ERBB2 amplification were annotated with therapeutic options in 270 reports (225 unique patients). The median survival time of a therapeutic option was nine months.
Conclusion
When compared to “traditional” clinical practice guideline recommendations, treatment options for personalized cancer therapy change seven times more rapidly; partly due to change in knowledge and partly due to logistics such as clinical trial availability.}

abstract = {Purpose
This study explores feasibility and safety of using enzymes (FpGalNAc deacetylase & FpGalNase) to remove ABO-A antigens from donor lungs during ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP). The enzymes have been reported to efficiently convert ABO-A blood to O (Withers, Nat Microbiol, 2019).
Methods
Human lungs (ABO-A1, n=5), declined for transplant, were treated with the enzymes during EVLP. Tissues were sampled before and after. The distribution and expression level of ABO antigens were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. Lung function was monitored for side-effects. Immediate post-transplant immune response was simulated in an ex vivo model of hyperacute lung rejection, with introduction of ABO-O plasma (carrying ABO antibodies) as the surrogate for the recipient circulation (Fig.1H, n=1). The physiology and histology of lungs were analyzed for anti-A-induced immune responses.
Results
The histo-blood type A (BTA) antigens in the A1 lungs are observed primarily on endothelial and epithelial cells. BTA were cleared remarkably well from treated lungs (Fig.1A). The enzymes convert vascular BTA to the blood group H (BTH) antigens found in ABO-O tissue (Fig.1B). Over 97% of endothelial BTA antigens were removed within the typical 4h clinical EVLP timeframe using very low dose (1 µg/mL) enzymes (Fig.1C). No acute side-effects were seen (Fig.1D-G). The rejection model showed that the 3-hour treatment of human lung with low dose enzymes prevented the damage triggered by type O plasma (presumably due to anti-A antibodies) as observed in the physiology and histology of the control lung (Fig.1I-J).
Conclusion
Ex vivo enzymatic treatment can efficiently remove ABO-A antigen in donor lungs without acute side-effects. Preliminary results show that the treatment can prevent ABO mismatch-induced early damages. The treatment can potentially allow expansion of ABO-incompatible lung transplantation, leading to significant improvements in logistics and fairness of organ allocation.}

Consequently, e-waste has become one of the fastest growing municipal solid waste streams in the United States making its efficient management crucial in supporting the efforts to create and sustain green cities. Accurate estimations on the amount of e-waste might help in increasing the efficiency of waste collection, recycling and disposal operations that have become more complicated and unpredictable. Early work focusing on prediction of e-waste generation includes a wide range of methodologies. Among these, grey forecasting models have drawn attention due to their capability to provide meaningful results with relatively small-sized or limited data. The performance of grey models heavily rely on their parameters. The purpose of this study is to present a novel forecasting technique for e-waste predictions with multiple inputs in presence of limited historical data. The proposed nonlinear grey Bernoulli model with convolution integral NBGMC(1,n) improved by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) demonstrates superior accuracy over alternative forecasting models. The proposed model and its findings are delineated with the help of a case study utilizing Washington State e-waste data. The results indicate that population density has a major impact on the generated e-waste followed by household income level. The findings also show that the e-waste generation forms a saturated distribution in Washington State. These results can help decision makers plan for more effective reverse logistics infrastructures that would ensure proper collection, recycling and disposal of e-waste.}

While global manufacturing networks often suffer the risks of oversupply and shortage of key components, the distributor that is the key intermediate participator in electronics product supply chain buys components from the suppliers, warehouses them, and resells different parts to a number of electronics manufacturers with vendor-managed inventories. Thus, the component distributors forecast the demands for large assortments of stock keeping units (SKUs) with distinct dynamics for inventory control and supply chain management. To address realistic needs to enhance demand forecast performance, this study aims to develop a UNISON data-driven analytics framework that integrates machine learning technologies and temporal aggregation mechanism to forecast the demands of intermittent electronics components. An empirical study is conducted in a world-leading semiconductor distributor for validation. The results have shown practical vitality of the proposed approach with better performance than conventional approaches and the existing practice.

Three types of waste thermoplastics were used, forming three separate batches of bricks. The plastics were polycarbonates, polystyrenes, and mixed plastics. The bricks were cured under water for 28 days. Some of the batches were baked at temperatures ranging from 90 °C to 110 °C for 2 hours in order to melt the plastics to form voids. The bricks made with the above-stated compositions were found to possess low thermal conductivity and adequately high compressive strength. The compressive strength of these bricks is observed to be more than 17 MPa, which lies within the upper half of the range of strengths specified for bricks in the IS 1077:1992 standard. The waste plastics impregnated bricks display high thermal resistance, a feature that can add economic value to the brick manufacturers, motivating them to establish the necessary logistics for collection and use of all types of waste thermoplastics. The paper also presents a regression model to predict the compressive strength of bricks at varying plastic contents. The study, thus, introduces a new strand of research on sustainable recycling of waste thermoplastics in the context of the circular economy.}

For some products with low transport temperatures, phase change materials (PCMs) from −10 C to −40 °C are still to be developed. This paper focuses on the development of a low phase transition temperature nanofluid phase change materials (NFPCMs) with excellent thermodynamic properties, simple preparation method and low cost. 23 wt% MgCl2 eutectic solution was used as phase change material in the NFPCMs, in which Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and nucleating agents play a supportive role to reduce supercooling degree. At that, the addition of MWCNTs increases the thermal conductivity and thickener xanthan gum (XG) can prevent phase separation and agglomeration. The NFPCM with 1 wt% MWCNTs has a phase transition temperature of −34.54 °C, a phase transition enthalpy of 146.9 kJ kg−1, and thermal conductivity of 0.5344 W (m k)−1. Also, under the synergistic action of MWCNTs with CaCl2 and Ca(OH)2, the supercooling degree of NFPCM decreased to 1.82 °C, which was 89% lower than that of the pure eutectic salt solution. Furthermore, the NFPCMs still showed excellent stability after 400 thermal cycles. The results show that the NFPCMs has high latent heat, higher thermal conductivity, low supercooling degree and excellent thermal stability, which makes it have practical application value and broad development prospects in the field of the cold chain.}

In many applications, it is likely that customers are not dichotomously covered by facilities, but gradually covered according to, e.g., the distance to the open facilities. Moreover, customers are not served by a single facility, but by a collection of them, which jointly serve them. In this paper we study the recently introduced multiple gradual cover location problem (MGCLP). The MGCLP addresses both of the issues described above. We propose the first exact approach to solve the MGCLP. In particular, we provide four different mixed-integer programming formulations for the MGCLP, all of them exploiting the submodularity of the objective function and developed a branch-and-cut framework based on these formulations. The framework is further enhanced by starting and primal heuristics and preprocessing procedures based on domination between facilities. The computational results show that our approach allows to effectively address different sets of instances. We provide equal or better solution values for 33 out of 40 instances from the literature, and provide proof of optimality for 20 of them (15 instances more with respect to previously published results). Many of these instances can be solved within a minute. We also introduce new instances with different characteristics and analyze the dependence of the structure of the obtained solutions with respect to such characteristics.}

However, such an approach leads to scattered literature and the possibility (or risk) that the focus could spin out of control in terms of the existing themes and future research trends. Consequently, the aim of this research is twofold: (i) to identify the main overarching themes discussed in the past and track their evolution over time, and (ii) propose a future research agenda for each overarching theme that considers the multidisciplinary nature of research efforts made on the topic. To reach the first objective, a method based on text mining was implemented. To reach the second one, a review based on recent and relevant paper was made for each overarching theme. Text mining suggests four overarching themes: (i) business, (ii) operations, (iii) technological solutions and (iv) work and skills. ‘Business’ includes studies that investigate the impact of Industry 4.0 on business perspectives and they suggest that governments and industries have a change in manufacturing perspective and attempt to benefit from this industrial revolution wave. ‘Operations’ includes studies investigating the impact of Industry 4.0 new technologies on production, logistics, and supply-chain processes. Manuscripts belonging to ‘Technological solutions’ discuss technological solutions at the core of Industry 4.0. ‘Work and skills’ stream of literature attempts to under the human element lurking behind the scene of Industry 4.0 regarding opportunities and implications.

The high cost of biomass feedstock and variations in its availability and quality are among the key barriers in bioenergy and biofuel development. Therefore, it is crucial to design and operate biomass supply chains that are efficient. In previous studies, simulation modelling was used to analyse biomass supply chains while incorporating its complexities and dynamic nature. Despite the impact of biomass storage on demand fulfilment and logistics cost, the problem of biomass inventory management is overlooked. In this paper, a simulation model is developed to compare demand fulfilment, cost, and emission of a forest-based biomass supply chain for two inventory systems: 1) order-up-to-level, and 2) fixed order quantity. Unlike the previous simulation studies, the considered supply chain includes multiple number of conversion facilities that use different types of biomass. Additionally, competition for biomass and logistical resources as well as substitution of biomass, when possible, are considered in the model. The simulation model is applied to a case study in Canada to assess different scenarios. The fixed order quantity system often results in higher demand fulfilment, however, it has higher cost and CO2 eq. emission compared with the order-up-to-level system. In both inventory systems, the transportation cost has the highest contribution to the total cost, ranging from 50% to 82% depending on the type of conversion facility. The grinding operation contributes the most (56%–81%) to the total CO2 eq. emission for both inventory systems.}

abstract = {Introduction
The nature and scope of emergency nursing exposes nurses to a wide array of patient populations with rapidly changing and unexpected clinical conditions, sophisticated logistics and procedures. Hence, emergency centre (EC) nurses ought to be ready to face diverse clinical challenges and deliver care to patients in a timely cost-effective manner and with the needed competence. The current study aimed at examining the self-assessed competencies of nurses, and comparing ratings among certified emergency nurses (ENs) and general nurses (GNs) working at an EC of a tertiary hospital in Ghana.
Methods
A descriptive cross-sectional quantitative study was carried out among 109 conveniently sampled nurses. Participants evaluated their perceived competencies on a validated instrument under five domains, namely: diagnostic function (DF), administering and monitoring therapeutic interventions (AMTI), effective management of rapidly changing situations (EMRCS), organisational and work load competency (OWLC), and the helping role (HR). Descriptive and inferential data analyses were by SPSS version 25.
Results
Participants generally had good competencies in the performance of emergency nursing procedures. Highest scores were obtained in OWLC (median score of 83.3%) while EMRCS recorded the least scores (median score of 57.9%). With the exception of the DF domain (p = 0.166), ENs perceived themselves as significantly more competent than their counterpart GNs in 4 (OWLC, HR, AMTI, EMRCS) out of the five studied domains (p < 0.05).
Discussion
Specialist training enhances nurses' perceived competences in emergency nursing procedures. This reiterates the need for regular theory and practice-based education for GNs on intermediate and advanced procedures as they prepare to enrol in specialist programmes. As nurses take on expanded professional roles in this emerging nursing specialty in low- and middle-income countries, it is important the needed capacity is developed to adequately address the needs of patients and families that require services in ECs.}

abstract = {Background
“Dabbing” involves vaporizing a “dab” of cannabis concentrate on a heated “nail,” passing the vapour through a water-pipe rig or portable pen device, and inhaling the vapour. While some cannabis industry media claims that this process is cleaner, safer, and more effective for getting high, medical and public health sources raise concerns about residual solvents and pesticides, unexpectedly intense effects, and rapid increases in tolerance. The aim of this study is to characterize the content of questions about dabbing posed in cannabis and dabbing-specific forums on the Reddit social media platform, as well as comment responses to these questions.
Methods
We conducted a content analysis of one year (2017) of information-seeking user-generated posts to three Reddit online cannabis community discussion forums (“subreddits”) that contained the terms “dab” and “question.” We also examined post engagement and the types and sentiment of information exchanged in the comment responses.
Results
Across 193 dabbing question posts, the most frequently asked question content was about types and logistical use of devices and related equipment (38%) and comparisons of cannabis products (32%), followed by questions about the step-by-step process of getting high (18%), legal issues (17%), and health concerns (13%). Nearly every post had a response (98%), with a median 5 comments per post and few negative (i.e. hostile, condescending, or trolling) comments (4%). Source of advice or information was stated in about a quarter (26%) of comment responses, with the overwhelming majority of this information (89%) coming from disclosures of personal experience vs. web or commercial sources.
Conclusion
People seeking advice online about dabbing inquired most often about logistics of use, but less often about health, tolerance, and legal risks. These findings may be used to inform public health efforts and health practitioner education as cannabis becomes increasingly legal and accessible.}

abstract = {Background
Real-time temperature monitoring during cold chain logistics is critical because refrigerated foods are sensitive to temperature fluctuations. Time-temperature indicators (TTIs) are effective tools for monitoring the temperature history of food products in real-time. These technologies have been widely used in fresh food management, showing great potential to reduce food waste, ensure food safety, and achieve realistic control of the cold chain and cold storage of foods.
Scope and approach
This review presents commonly used modelling methods for TTIs establishment, including reaction rate constant (k) and activation energy (Ea) determination and Ea matching. Through mathematical modelling, shelf-life of TTIs can be matched with shelf-life of target foods, making response changes of TTIs reflect food quality. For the first time, different apparent response types of TTIs are summarized, covering colour-based, acidity-based, diffusion length-based, and other responses-based TTIs. Besides, TTIs applications in cold chain management of fresh foods are also highlighted concerning dairy, meat and aquatic products, and vegetables.
Key findings and conclusions
TTIs are effective temperature-sensitive monitoring tools and have been studied for monitoring various refrigerated fresh food products, especially for meat and aquatic products. Arrhenius equation is the most widely used mathematical modelling for matching kinetics of the food products and the TTI responses. Colour-based responses increasingly become the most popular response types of TTIs for the advantages of convenient and direct observation. The future trends of TTIs development should mainly focus on the integration of multiple quality indicators, constituent simplification, cost reduction, and modelling optimization.}

The existing model has a number of deficiencies, including not meeting the entire demand of the state, an excessive number of small landfills and several non-contiguous consortia, resulting in higher unnecessary costs to the taxpayer. The main contribution of this article is to propose a model of territorial partitioning that does not depend on extra restrictions to maintain contiguous clusters. This was possible due to the use of the Haversine distance between each municipality as the cost variable in a p-Medians Problem (PMP) model. The data for the municipalities and MSW production were obtained from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) and from the State Secretariat for the Environment and Water Resources (SEMA-PR) databases. The road distance between each municipality (shortest route) was consulted using the Google Distance Matrix API. Two simulations were conducted to determine the best configuration of this waste distribution network. The first simulation did not consider already existing landfills. In other words, an ideal situation was proposed that was impractical because there are already operational landfills in the state. It would be a feasible alternative if the objective was to implement a new network. This model reduced transport costs by approximately 49% compared with the current system. Moreover, it would cost 4.4% less to construct than the existing one. The second simulation considered the state’s operational landfills, altering only the customer base and respective capacities. It was concluded that it would be necessary to add 25 new landfills to fully meet the requirements of the state. In this more realistic simulation, transport costs were reduced by around 80% and the cost of its construction would be only approximately 6% higher than the current solution. Policy makers and urban planners will be able to use this optimization model in decision making regarding the improvement of MSW management systems and reverse logistics, allowing for improvements for serving citizens and reducing the environmental impact.}

This manuscript presents an assessment of urban road freight in the MRSP based on primary metrics carried out by the Municipality’s survey in 2016 on light- and heavy-duty vehicles (LDVs and HDVs). Origin (O) and destination (D) freight activity indicators provide a baseline for assessing trends in efficiency and operational performance. These descriptive (DIs) and key performance indicators (KPIs) come directly and indirectly from the O and D company vehicle survey and identify space and temporal distributions of main freight transport sources by vehicle and commodity types. This paper addresses the need to use the vehicle survey to understand road freight activity and transportation in MRSP and with successive editions of the freight survey it will be possible to track the development of the commodity’s transport content to reveal a chronological development in freight logistics and emissions. As the metropolitan region sprawls, it is important to track these metrics in order to define and evaluate sound measures and policies to improve life and air quality. Assumptions and analyses of freight road transport in São Paulo find significant new perspectives to handle several issues in order to assess and improve vehicle utilization, fuel efficiency and CO2 emissions in future over time. This research has potential significant impact in other Latin American cities and the results can be extrapolated to other local freight inventories and be used to provide freight metrics to be included in Brazil’s National Determined Commitments (NDC).}

By solving these optimisation problems, organisations can efficiently utilise logistical resources and improve delivery performance. Because of their complexity, finding optimal solution is challenging. Existing solution methods based on integer programming and meta-heuristics have shown promising results for small instances but become less efficient when they are applied to large-scale instances with hundreds of jobs. This paper presents a new hybrid optimisation method that combines the power of differential evolution, iterated greedy search, mixed integer programming, and parallel computing to solve resource constrained job scheduling problems. The experimental results with existing benchmark datasets and a set of 1755 newly generated instances show that the proposed algorithm can find high quality solutions even for hard instances. For small and medium instances, the optimality gaps of the proposed algorithms are significantly better than those of the mixed integer programming solver and the column generation algorithm. For large instances, the proposed algorithms can find solutions with significantly better upper bounds as compared to existing meta-heuristics and the state-of-the-art hybrid algorithm. The analyses also confirm the advantage of using multiple processing cores to improve the efficiency and solution quality of the proposed algorithm.}

Integrated vascular surgery residency is among the most competitive specialties, but little is known about the applicant perspective. The coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak impacted the 2021 integrated vascular surgery residency match because of travel restrictions. We sought to better understand pre-pandemic applicant recruitment strategies, logistics of away rotations, and the residency interview process to identify areas for improvement in the application process.
Methods
An anonymous survey was sent to matched students in 2020, inquiring about motivations for pursuing vascular surgery (VS), logistic of away rotations and interviews, and factors influencing students' rank lists.
Results
Seventy of the 73 matched students completed the survey (95.9% response rate). The median age was 27 (range, 25-41); 32.9% were female, 91.4% were U.S. medical students, and 77.1% were from institutions with a VS training program. Factors most strongly influencing the decision to choose VS as a career were interest in open vascular procedures, endovascular procedures, perceived job satisfaction, emerging technologies, and influence of a mentor. The prospect of the job market, future salary, and competitiveness of the application process had the least impact. Of the matched students, 82.9% completed an away rotation (median, 2; range, 1-4), with 51.7% of students paying a total cost of more than $2500. Fifty percent of students matched either at their home institution or where they had performed an away rotation. Students reported application submissions to a median of 50 programs (range, 1-70) and interviewed at 17 (range, 1-28), with 40% of students paying a total of more than $4000 for interview costs. The most significant factors affecting students' rank lists included program culture, open aortic surgical volume, geography, and complex endovascular procedure volume. Tours of facilities, resident salary, and male/female distribution had the least importance.
Conclusions
Successfully matched applicants in 2020 prioritized operative case volume and program collegiality when ranking programs. Despite their high cost, away rotations played an important role in the Match, suggesting that time spent at potential institutions allowed ideal assessment of factors for students. The high average number of away rotations and in-person interviews performed in 2019-2020 was limited for the 2021 Match due to coronavirus disease 2019 restrictions. Programs will have to continue developing creative alternatives or additions to away rotations and the application processes to assure continued success in future post-pandemic Match cycles.}

This study is one of the first to estimate the demand for such a service and provide recommendations on the potential location of facilities to support this network operations. We adopt a two-phase approach: phase-1 estimates the demand for air taxi services by taking a subset of the regular taxi customers who are likely to avail this service, and phase-2 proposes a constrained clustering approach, with multimodal transportation-based warm start technique, to identify potential sites for locating infrastructures based on the estimated demand. We test the feasibility of the proposed approach using millions of real-life New York City taxi records. Results indicate that large facilities with a capacity of nearly 150 landings/hour have to be established in JFK International Airport and South Central Park, while smaller stops are required in World Trade Center, Washington Square and Allerton Ballfields. In addition, we evaluate the impact of the commuter’s “willingness to fly” rate, demand fulfillment rate and time-cost tradeoffs. Our analysis shows that the percentage of time savings and “willingness to fly” rate did not significantly impact location decisions and the number of sites, while it is necessary to conduct an intense market study to determine on-road travel limits. Insights provided in this study can act as a decision support tool for any logistics company that is interested in venturing into the air taxi market.}

Intense livestock production, increased travel, and changing climate have increased the risk of catastrophic animal losses due to infectious diseases. In the event of an outbreak, it is essential to properly manage the infected animals to prevent the spread of diseases. The most common disposal methods used during a disease outbreak include burial, landfilling, incineration and composting. Biosecurity, transportation logistics, public perception, and environmental concerns limit the use of some of these methods. During a disease outbreak, the large number of mortalities often exceeds the capacity of local rendering plants and landfills. Transporting mortalities to disposal and incineration facilities outside the production operation introduces biosecurity risks. Burying mortalities is limited by the size and availability of suitable sites and it has the risk of pathogen survival and contamination of groundwater and soil. Portable incinerators are expensive and have the potential to aerosolize infectious particles. Composting, on the other hand, has been recognized as a biosecure disposal method. Research showed that it eliminates bacterial pathogens such as Escherichia coli O157: H7, Salmonella spp., as well as viruses including highly pathogenic avian influenza, foot-and-mouth disease, Newcastle disease, and porcine epidemic diarrhea. This paper summarizes the lessons learned during the major animal disease outbreaks including the 2010 foot-and-mouth disease, 2016 highly pathogenic avian influenza, and recent African swine fever outbreaks. The purpose of this review is to critically discuss the biosecurity of composting as a mortality disposal method during the outbreaks of infectious animal diseases.}

abstract = {Real-time crash potential prediction could provide valuable information for Active Traffic Management Systems. Fixed infrastructure-based vehicle detection devices were widely used in the previous studies to obtain different types of data for crash potential prediction. However, it was difficult to obtain data in large range through these devices due to the costs of installation and maintenance. This paper introduced a novel connected vehicle (CV) emulated data for real-time crash potential prediction. Different from the fixed devices’ data, CV emulated data have high flexibility and can be obtained continuously with relatively low cost. Crash and CV emulated data were collected from two urban arterials in Orlando, USA. Crash data were archived by the Signal for Analytics system (S4A), while the CV emulated data were obtained through the data collection API with a high frequency. Different data cleaning and preparation techniques were implemented, while various speed-related variables were generated from the CV emulated data. A Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) neural network was trained to predict the crash potential in the next 5−10 min. The results from the model illustrated the feasibility of using a novel CV emulated data to predict real-time crash potential. The average and 50th percentile speed were the two most important variables for the crash potential prediction. In addition, the proposed LSTM outperformed Bayesian logistics regression and XGBoost in terms of sensitivity, Area under Curve (AUC), and false alarm rate. With the rapid development of the connected vehicle systems, the results from this paper can be extended to other types of vehicles and data, which can significantly enhance traffic safety.}

abstract = {Background
The COVID-19 pandemic has placed an extraordinary strain on healthcare systems across North America. Defining the optimal approach for managing a critically ill COVID-19 patient is rapidly changing. Goal-directed transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is frequently used by physicians caring for intubated critically ill patients as a reliable imaging modality that is well suited to answer questions at bedside.
Methods
A multidisciplinary (intensive care, critical care cardiology, and emergency medicine) group of experts in point-of-care echocardiography and TEE from the United States and Canada convened to review the available evidence, share experiences, and produce a consensus statement aiming to provide clinicians with a framework to maximize the safety of patients and healthcare providers when considering focused point-of-care TEE in critically ill patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Results
Although transthoracic echocardiography can provide the information needed in most patients, there are specific scenarios in which TEE represents the modality of choice. TEE provides acute care clinicians with a goal-directed framework to guide clinical care and represents an ideal modality to evaluate hemodynamic instability during prone ventilation, perform serial evaluations of the lungs, support cardiac arrest resuscitation, and guide veno-venous ECMO cannulation. To aid other clinicians in performing TEE during the COVID-19 pandemic, we describe a set of principles and practical aspects for performing examinations with a focus on the logistics, personnel, and equipment required before, during, and after an examination.
Conclusions
In the right clinical scenario, TEE is a tool that can provide the information needed to deliver the best and safest possible care for the critically ill patients.}

abstract = {Greenhouse gas emissions caused by urban road mobility have reached unsustainable levels, being partly responsible for both, the current global warming alarming situation and the pollutant emissions risk to the health of citizens. Transport electrification represents an encouraging solution to this problem. The development and improvement of electric vehicle technology combined with transportation management strategies have become relevant research topics, not only in the area of mobility of people, but also to large companies whose supply chain may involve hundreds of commercial vehicles. The costs from running these vehicles represent a significant impact on their finance and controlling fuel usage is often a key contributor to keep running costs under control across their fleet and supply chain. In this context, traffic regulation elements evaluation, considering its uncertainty, could represent a significant influence on the vehicle consumption and, consequently, on its indirect greenhouse gas emissions. For this reason, traffic regulation system analysis may represent a step forward for developing solutions that collaborate with both, pollution and global warming, abatement. The present study proposes a predictive methodology for determining battery electric vehicle consumption variations when modifying traffic regulation elements. It uses stochastic speed profiles for neutralizing human intervention in consumption and multiple linear regressions to predict the energy consumed by the electric vehicle as a function of a set of factors that represent the traffic regulations. The research does not aim to provide particular energy consumption data, but to expose the variations in consumption and emissions caused by urban planning modifications. Model accuracy and achieved conclusions are illustrated through the development of a case study. The methodology could be a help for urban planners, fleet managers, logistics and supply chain decision makers environmentally concerned.}

To optimize the control and logistics of postharvest cold chains, we need to better identify trade-offs between maintaining fruit quality and reducing environmental impacts. Therefore, we propose a novel computational method, by combining life cycle assessment with virtual cold chains. This holistic approach allows us, on the one hand, to track the thermal history of the cooling process and fruit quality decay of each single fruit in an entire pallet throughout the cold chain, using computational fluid dynamics. On the other hand, the carbon footprint of the supply chain is quantified. This pioneering method enriches life cycle assessment with more customized input data from multiphysics modeling, and at the same time assesses food quality evolution throughout the supply chain. Significant differences between ventilated carton designs (63 g CO2-eq/kg) and cold chain scenarios (11 g CO2-eq/kg) were identified, namely, 10% and 1.6% of the environmental impact of the entire supply chain, respectively. If solar electricity is used for precooling, the environmental impact was reduced by 55 g CO2-eq/kg of fruit (or 8.5%), while still providing similar fruit quality retention. By combining climate impact with the predicted quality retention, this method will help retailers to choose the most optimal package design and cold chain scenario to make their food supply chains more sustainable. This approach can be applied as well to life cycle assessment of biogas conversion of food waste, amongst others.}

abstract = {Background
Hepatitis C virus elimination may be possible by scaling up direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment. Due to the safety and simplicity of DAA treatment, primary care-based treatment delivery is now feasible, efficacious and may be cheaper than hospital-based specialist care. In this paper, we use Prime Study data – a randomised controlled trial comparing the uptake of DAA treatment between primary and hospital-based care settings amongst people who inject drugs (PWID) – to estimate the cost of initiating treatment for PWID diagnosed with hepatitis C in primary care compared to hospital-based care.
Methods
The total economic costs associated with delivering DAA treatment (post hepatitis C diagnosis) within the Prime study – including health provider time/training, medical tests, equipment, logistics and pharmacy costs – were collected. Appointment data were used to estimate the number/type of appointments required to initiate treatment in each case, or the stage at which loss to follow up occurred.
Results
Among the hepatitis C patients randomised to be treated within primary care, 43/57 (75%) commenced treatment at a mean cost of A$885 (95% CI: A$850–938) per patient initiating treatment. In hospital-based care, 18/53 hepatitis C patients (34%) commenced treatment at a mean cost of A$2078 (range: A$2052–2394) per patient initiating treatment – more than twice as high as primary care. The lower cost in the primary care arm was predominantly the result of increased retention in care compared to the hospital-based arm.
Conclusions
Compared to hospital-based care, providing hepatitis C services for PWID in primary care can improve treatment uptake and approximately halve the average cost of treatment initiation. To improve treatment uptake and cure, countries should consider primary care as the main model for hepatitis C treatment scale-up.}

abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, commonly known as drones, have attained considerable interest in recent years due to the potential of revolutionizing transport and logistics. Amazon were among the first to introduce the idea of using drones to deliver goods, followed by several other distribution companies working on similar services. The Traveling Salesman Problem, frequently used for planning last-mile delivery operations, can easily be modified to incorporate drones, resulting in a routing problem involving both the truck and aircraft. Introduced by Murray and Chu (2015), the Flying Sidekick Traveling Salesman Problem considers a drone and truck collaborating. The drone can be launched and recovered at certain visits on the truck route, making it possible for both vehicles to deliver goods to customers in parallel. This generalization considerably decreases the operational cost of the routes, by reducing the total fuel consumption for the truck, as customers on the routes can be serviced by drones without covering additional miles for the trucks, and hence increase productivity. In this paper a mathematical model is formulated, defining a problem similar to the Flying Sidekick Traveling Salesman Problem, but for the capacitated multiple-truck case with time limit constraints and minimizing cost as objective function. The corresponding problem is denoted the Vehicle Routing Problem with Drones. Due to the difficulty of solving large instances to optimality, an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search metaheuristic is proposed. Finally, extensive computational experiments are carried out. The tests investigate, among other things, how beneficial the inclusion of the drone-delivery option is compared to delivering all items using exclusively trucks. Moreover, a detailed sensitivity analysis is performed on several drone-parameters of interest.}

Data were collected through a questionnaire-based survey of 821 Italian companies. A cluster analysis was performed to classify their current level of implementation of the circular economy principles and a logit regression was carried out to identify the most effective drivers. Five clusters were identified: 1) “information-oriented companies” (24%), the best at communication and marketing-related activities, but the worst in relation to all the other aspects; 2) “linear companies” (41.6%), those that perform poorly in all five phases; 3) “green marketers” (15.5%), which perform well in relation to design, production and consumption; 4) “optimizers” (10.6%), which focus more on production and logistics and 5) “circular companies” (8.1%), those that register a good performance with respect to all aspects. The bad performers, clusters 1 and 2, also registered the worst economic results in the last three years, whereas the “circular champions” reported the best performance. Finally, the logit regression showed that economic drivers were the most effective at encouraging “linear companies” to adopt more circular business models. On the other hand, no significant evidence was found of any influence exerted by the drivers related to regulatory pressure, resource exploitation risks, and the pursuit of environmental values.}

We examined effects of group size on the behaviour of sows and the ease of moving them from the entrance of a slaughterhouse and towards the lairage pens. The study included 30 truck loads of cull sows (and a few breeding boars, as they were transported to slaughter together with the sows; 1917 sows and 55 boars). The sows were transported between 4.2–7.5 hours in fully air-suspended two-deck trucks, approved for transport of sows. Half of the loads were moved from the trucks as full loads (32−95 sows per load), the other half split into smaller groups of 5–6 sows. The behaviour of sows and handlers was observed directly, while they were entering the slaughterhouse and walked along a downward sloping concrete aisle measuring 1.1 m (width) and 13.2 m (length) ramp, approaching a 90° corner on the way to the lairage pens. Differences in the behaviour of the handlers between the two treatments were minor, but moving sows in smaller groups did, contrarily to our expectations, prolong the duration of the procedure, probably due to the sorting into smaller groups onboard of the truck. The results confirmed that passing a corner may constitute an obstacle for the ease of moving sows, especially when they were moved as full loads, as a higher proportion of these sows stopped or blocked the aisle near the corner, than the sows moved in smaller groups. In addition, a higher proportion of the sows moved as full loads turned 180° against the direction of intended movement. In conclusion, modulation of the group size of sows upon arrival at a slaughterhouse affected their behaviour and the ease of movement. Further studies are needed to examine cost-benefit of low group size when moving sows in terms of animal welfare, human well-being and logistics.}

In this study, a spatially based dynamic model has been created to quantify the impacts (measured in carbon emissions, CO2eq.) from the express delivery sector in China. Specifically, intracity (urban) express delivery services—delivery and pick-up services located within the same city—was chosen for analysis. The results indicated that the carbon emissions from the transportation phase of the express delivery sector in Chinese cities varied from 20 t to 4000 t in 2017, of which 18% was attributable to the weight of extra packaging materials. Carbon emission intensities for all cities showed a close relationship with their socioeconomic status. For example, the spatial pattern of intracity express delivery volumes and associated carbon emissions showed a significant clustering property: high-value cities were clustered in eastern China and low-value cities in western China. Furthermore, the carbon hotspots were mainly located in the Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta urban agglomerations. Overall, our research method and preliminary findings could be helpful for the green development of the booming express delivery sector in China and beyond.}

We aimed to analyze the role of platelet count (PC), mean platelet volume (MPV), and ratio of PC to MPV (PC/MPV) in predicting and/or diagnosing atypical pre-eclampsia (PE).
Study design
We performed a retrospective case–control analysis of these platelet parameters in healthy pregnant women with normal blood pressure (control) and the changes that occurred in patients with atypical PE and PE.
Main outcome measures
We performed statistical analysis to evaluate the prognostic and predictive significance of PC, MPV, and PC/MPV and the combined effects of these parameters in the parturient population (N = 300) composed of 100 controls, 100 atypical PE cases, and 100 PE cases.
Results
The PC, MPV, and PC/MPV in both atypical PE and PE were significantly different to that in the controls. After adjusting for confounding factors using the ordinal logistics regression model, we found that PC/MPV, N% and BMI were independent risk factors for PE and atypical PE(The odds ratio was 0.925, 1.028 and 1.071). The model’s C-index is 0.684.
Conclusion
We found that the PC, MPV, and PC/MPV may be changed in atypical PE patients who did not have significant PE symptoms. Our results indicated that it could be a diagnostic method to predict atypical PE during pregnancy. PC/MPV and the other platelet parameters can play a role in predicting the development of atypical PE, leading to better diagnosis and management of atypical PE.}

It is imperative that logistic key performance indicators (KPIs) be considered along with product costs and product quality to obtain a competitive advantage. Numerous companies possess an internal supply chain that fails to meet logistic performance goals set by the management. The measurables for logistic performance include logistic KPIs such as delivery time as well as cost relevant figures including work-in-process or the utilization of employees. In a case of unsatisfactory logistic KPIs, it is pertinent to identify the root causes before attempting to rectify the situation. Increasing digitalization within industry means a substantial volume of confirmation data is available regarding the core processes of a company’s internal supply chain. This study discloses a model-based analysis of confirmation data to identify the root causes of unsatisfactory logistic KPIs. A framework for the analysis is constructed by defining generic cause-and-effect relationships between the relevant logistic KPIs and influencing as well as disturbing factors. The results produced by the model-based analysis and the interpretation of the confirmation data show the occurring cause-and-effect relationships for particular use cases and deduce the root causes for insufficient logistic KPIs. From there, companies can develop and implement suitable steps to increase the logistic KPIs by focusing on the newly-identified root causes instead of non-related, but recurring, complications. A case study is included to show the practicality of the presented method. The root cause analysis provides the basis for advanced logistics controlling systems to automatically identify weak-points and propose counteractive measures and therefore continuously improve and adapt the supply chain to changing conditions.}

The curriculum was developed and implemented with two cohorts of trainees from primary care, mental health and pharmacy disciplines (n =31) that were immersed in an interprofessional team caring for homeless Veterans in a patient-centered medical home (PCMH). Our curriculum is relevant for any clinical site seeking to improve team-based care for patients with complex conditions. It is grounded in an evidence-derived team performance framework that addresses three key aspects of well-performing teams: meeting practices (standardizing time and processes for collaborative care using checklists), taskwork (understanding team members' roles and responsibilities, and how to improve care), and teamwork (building humanistic relationships with patients and team members, and communicating respectfully). The curriculum is experiential and requires trainees to work on an existing patient care team and participate in team-based care processes (e.g. huddles, team meetings, panel management). We address stakeholder engagement, faculty and team development, culture building and logistics. Using two previously validated instruments to assess trainee perceptions of team performance and personal burnout at 6 and 12 months, we found that the program led to improvements in trainees’ perspectives of team performance, their relationship skills, and the effectiveness of their meeting practices, while also avoiding burnout. Key factors contributing to the success of the program are co-locating the professions, faculty role-modeling of team practice and communication behaviors, promotion of a relationship-centered culture, regularly scheduled workplace learning activities and planned IP learning sessions that support team-based practice.}

The objective is to find the best combination of vehicles to be loaded on auto-carriers over a multiple-day planning horizon, such that the total transportation cost is minimized, while respecting all the loading constraints, and the delivery deadlines are fulfilled to the most possible extent. Trip costs do not depend on the scheduled or actual route of the auto-carrier, split deliveries are allowed and constraint upon reloads is not imposed. The problems solved by the proposed formulation consider the transportation cost of real- world auto-carriers – with two loading platforms able to hold up to six vehicles each – calculated as the highest value between a minimum trip- cost and the sum of the transportation cost of all the vehicles loaded in the auto-carrier, calculated as the distance of a vehicle to its dealer adjusted by the vehicle size factor. Moreover, there are set formation constraints related to feasible combinations of vehicles with different sizes, and maximum and minimum number of vehicles allowed to be loaded on an auto-carrier. Computational results on a set of problems derived from real-world distribution cases faced by a major third-party logistics (3PL) provider in Brazil show that the application of the mathematical model while considering the dynamic nature of the problem yield to cost savings from 8.4% to 15.6% and also considerably reduces the number of vehicles delivered with delays.}

Firstly, we sought to determine serum Hp concentration in red deer (Cervus elaphus) naturally infected with bovine tuberculosis (TB). Secondly, we assessed the complementary diagnostic value of serum Hp levels in conjunction with the cervical comparative skin test (CCT) performed in a subsample (n = 33). Serum Hp concentrations were significantly higher in TB-infected individuals (based on the presence of macroscopic lesions confirmed by culture) compared to those uninfected. In addition, serum Hp significantly changed with the type of animal handling, with captured and handled animals showing higher levels of Hp than hunted animals. Four out of 6 TB positive individuals that tested negative to the CCT (false negatives) showed Hp levels higher than the 95th percentile of healthy animals. These findings indicate that an acute phase response develops in animals with TB. In this paper, we demonstrate for the first time that an acute phase protein can provide a complementary assessment for specific diagnosis tests in wild species.}

Development and manufacturing of cell based immunotherapies rely on methods that can accurately identify and quantify cell purity. Current methods predominantly rely on the detection of biomarkers using flow cytometry. These methods, while effective for the detection of surface antigens such as CD8+ that positively identifies Cytotoxic T lymphocytes, are more challenging to implement for intracellular markers; for example those that are used to positive identify Regulatory T (Treg) cells and T Helper 17 (Th17) cells. Additionally, characterization methods that utilize live cells pose a challenge in large scale GMP manufacturing environment due to complicated logistics, limited throughput and can be difficult to standardize. Therefore, there is an emerging need for alternative assay methods that address some of these challenges.
Methods, Results & Conclusion
Here, we report the development of PureQuant Methylation Assays that specifically identifies and quantifies immune cell types based on their unique DNA methylation status. Percentage of CD8, Treg and Th17 was determined by detecting methylation status specific for cytotoxic T cells, FoxP3 and IL17A respectively, via qPCR of bisulfite converted genomic DNA. Unlike flow cytometry, methylation workflow for surface and intracellular markers are similar and avoid the need for stimulation for the detection of low marker levels such as Th17. These assays require minimal sample, can use fresh/frozen cells or isolated gDNA and can be carried out on any standard qPCR instrument. The combination of accuracy, low sample requirement and flexibility provides an ideal measurement system for confirmation of identify and purity of T cell types critical for therapeutic applications.}

abstract = {The oilfield produced water treatment has been the focus of intense research, due to the presence of high amount of dissolved organic compounds, heavy metals and other chemicals, whose discharge is regulated by environmental agencies. Between them, naphthenic acids (NAs) are naturally-occurring carboxylic acids that contributes to increase the total oil and grease content of the oilfield produced water. However, in current offshore facilities, only compact technologies with low water retention may be used to its treatment. In this sense, the main advantage of the liquid–liquid extraction process is related to the process logistics, since the oil industry can use its products and byproducts as extraction solvents. This study evaluated the use of a synthetic condensate, simulating an available fluid on-site of oil platforms, as a cyclohexanecarboxylic acid extracting solvent. This specific O2-NA specie is generally more resistant to degradation and may persist in aqueous systems. In addition, the use of pure n-hexane and n-heptane were also studied to support the synthetic condensate investigation. The extraction performance was assessed in terms of solvent type and proportion, pH, initial NA concentration, temperature and salt concentration in the synthetic oilfield produced water. It was observed that the organic solvent proportion and solution pH exerted a significant influence on the extraction efficiency, being the process especially favored in acid pH (≤4). On the other hand, the temperature, solvent type and salt concentration did not affect the obtained results significantly. The best extraction conditions were defined to increase the NA removal and to decrease possible effects on the seabed due to disposal, ensuring compliance with environmental legislation and process robustness. At pH 2 and with 75% of synthetic condensate as extraction fluid, a record extraction efficiency of 81% O2-NA removal was achieved.}

Experiment results reveal that Pd/rGO/α-Fe2O3 can detect ehylene in the concentration as low as 10 ppb, which is the best one among all the ethylene gas sensors and has made a major breakthrough in the detection limit of ethylene. Besides, other sensing performance, including operation temperature (250 °C), the response-recovery time (18 s and 50 s), and examination range (from 10 ppb to 1000 ppm) all have been significantly improved. The high specific surface area of flower-like hierarchical porous structure, the catalysis of Pd nanoparticles, and chemically active defect sites of rGO all contribute to the high sensing performances of Pd/rGO/α-Fe2O3 in detecting ethylene. These do provide a practical method for detecting low concentrations of ethylene and make it more competitive to detect ethylene with low cost and convenient gas sensors.}

The problems brought about by the waste in today's societies, if not attended to, may become more devastating in the future for generations after us. A myriad of research has been published in the area of industrial waste management; however, no study until now has pointed to the management of wastes produced in the automotive industry. Therefore, this study sought to describe an industrial waste transportation system in the automotive industry by proposing a capacitated location routing model with a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles. This research attempted to demonstrate the model efficiency considering a case from the SAIPA car Company in Iran. First, the waste collection network was considered based on a mixed integer bi-objective optimization model. Decisions about the route of collection vehicles, the location of collection centers, the inventory level in these centers, the reduction of the costs, the risk posed to the population, the categorization of transportation of different waste types and the estimation of the number of vehicles in the transportation phase were also made in this study. Second, to test the model as well as performing several numerical examples, the improved version of the epsilon-constraint was applied via the CPLEX solver embedded in the GAMS software. Decisions were also made regarding the optimal technology for the disposal of non-recyclable wastes and the selection of optimal sites for both disposal and recycle facilities, considering the irreconcilable economic, social, environmental, and technical criteria. Moreover, a hybrid multi-criteria decision-making approach, combining best worst method with PROMETHEE-II was proposed. Generally, numerical examples proved that the proposed MIP model with the consideration heterogeneous transport fleet and waste collection in separated manner was a safe solution in order to reduce logistics costs in the presence of transportation risk criteria.}

Subunit vaccines are preferred due to high safety, but are inherently difficult to deliver orally, thus providing motivation for the use of advanced oral delivery systems. Polymeric devices in micrometer size (microcontainers) were tested here for this purpose. Microcontainers were loaded with a vaccine consisting of spray dried cubosomes with OVA and Quil-A, and coated with a pH-sensitive lid for oral delivery to C57Bl/6 mice. The microcontainers were explored in vitro and in vivo for their potential as oral vaccine delivery system in an oral prime-boost setting and as an oral booster after a subcutaneously injected prime. The residence time of microcontainers in the small intestine was less than one hour. Eudragit® L100–55 was therefore chosen as lid material on the microcontainers as it remained stable in vitro at pH 4.7, which simulated the maximal pH of the stomach, and allowed release of the cubosomes within 30–60 min at pH 6.6, which simulated the mean pH of the distal half of the small intestine. In vitro small angle X-ray scattering showed that cubosomes dissolved in small intestinal fluid when not confined in microcontainers but when loaded into microcontainers they were released as hexosomes. However, while microcontainers could protect and release particles with OVA and Quil-A within relevant time frames in vitro, an immune response was not elicited in vivo after oral administration. Nonetheless, some effect was observed when the microcontainers were used to deliver oral boosters following a subcutaneous prime. This work indicates that oral vaccination with subunit vaccines has potential when combined with a parenteral prime and that oral delivery systems like microcontainers may be used to increase the potency of vaccines with low oral immunogenicity.}

abstract = {Objective
Most treatment options for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2/3 (CIN2/3) are either excisional or ablative, and require sequential visits to health care providers. Artesunate, a compound that is WHO-approved for treatment of acute malaria, also has cytotoxic effect on squamous cells transformed by HPV. We conducted a first-in-human Phase I dose-escalation study to assess the safety and efficacy of self-administered artesunate vaginal inserts in biopsy-confirmed CIN2/3.
Methods
Safety analyses were based on patients who received at least one dose, and were assessed by the severity, frequency, and duration of reported adverse events. Tolerability was assessed as the percentage of subjects able to complete their designated dosing regimen. Modified intention-to-treat analyses for efficacy and viral clearance were based on patients who received at least one dose for whom endpoint data were available. Efficacy was defined as histologic regression to CIN1 or less. Viral clearance was defined as absence of HPV genotoype (s) detected at baseline.
Results
A total of 28 patients received 1, 2, or 3 five-day treatment cycles at study weeks 0, 2, and 4, respectively, prior to a planned, standard-of-care resection at study week 15. Reported adverse events were mild, and self-limited. In the modified intention-to-treat analysis, histologic regression was observed in 19/28 (67.9%) subjects. Clearance of HPV genotypes detected at baseline occurred in 9 of the 19 (47.4%) subjects whose lesions underwent histologic regression.
Conclusions
Self-administered vaginal artesunate inserts were safe and well-tolerated, at clinically effective doses to treat CIN2/3. These findings support proceeding with Phase II clinical studies.}

To describe the architecture, design, and testing of an innovative mobile application (Medivate) that facilities accurate sharing of medication lists with linked education.
Setting
The deployment and testing of this app occurred in both the community and hospital settings in Pittsburgh, PA.
Practice innovation
Medivate is an iOS smartphone application and cloud architecture for patients and providers to keep medication and vaccine lists accurate by providing a method and tool to easily exchange these data. Medications are added directly to the app from the electronic health record (EHR) or by the patient manually. Quick response (QR) code technology is used to trigger the secure transfer and sharing of medications on demand via HL-7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources–based data transfer. An iterative user-centered design process involving patients and student pharmacists practicing in community settings was used to develop and refine functionality.
Practice description
Adults with an iPhone were approached for participation in the design and evaluation of Medivate. Its functionality and integration into clinical workflow at hospital discharge or vaccine administration in the community were determined.
Evaluation
In the community setting, interviews of pharmacists were conducted. In the hospital, metrics of study participation and experience with app deployment were determined.
Results
The app was deployed in the community for patients that received vaccinations. Interviews provided insight into barriers and logistics for successful engagement. The app was integrated into hospital workflow and demonstrated interoperability with the inpatient EHR. Thirteen patients were provided the app before discharge. Engagement with the app was evident through medication list shares, education access, and changes to medication lists. Patients noted strong agreement with usefulness of the app to learn more about the purposes and adverse effects of medications prescribed.
Conclusion
A mobile app to achieve medication and vaccine list portability was successfully designed and integrated into the inpatient and community settings.}

However, processes for determining the causality of AEs are often sub-optimal, unreliable, and inefficient. Thus, we conducted a toxicity-attribution workshop in Silver Springs MD to develop guidance for improving attribution of AEs in oncology clinical trials. Attribution stakeholder experts from regulatory agencies, sponsors and contract research organizations, clinical trial principal investigators, pre-clinical translational scientists, and research staff involved in capturing attribution information participated. We also included patients treated in oncology clinical trials and academic researchers with expertise in attribution. We identified numerous challenges with AE attribution, including the non-informative nature of and burdens associated with the 5-tier system of attribution, increased complexity of trial logistics, costs and time associated with AE attribution data collection, lack of training in attribution for early-career investigators, insufficient baseline assessments, and lack of consistency in the reporting of treatment-related and treatment-emergent AEs in publications and clinical scientific reports. We developed recommendations to improve attribution: we propose transitioning from the present 5-tier system to a 2–3 tier system for attribution, more complete baseline information on patients’ clinical status at trial entry, and mechanisms for more rapid sharing of AE information during trials. Oncology societies should develop recommendations and training in attribution of toxicities. We call for further harmonization and synchronization of recommendations regarding causality safety reporting between FDA, EMA and other regulatory agencies. Finally, we suggest that journals maintain or develop standardized requirements for reporting attribution in oncology clinical trials.}

Under a two-echelon setting, shipments from geographically dispersed sources that are en route to the customer are first transported to intermediary facilities for possible consolidation into full-container loads. Each shipment has a preset pickup date at the source and a delivery time window at the destination. Further, each shipment can be partitioned into multiple shipments that can be routed to different intermediary facilities. Shipments reaching the intermediary facilities are consolidated and forwarded to the final destination in the second echelon. A mixed integer programming model is developed for this problem, which employs piecewise cost functions to capture the economies of scales that are common in transportation. To speed up obtaining solutions, an exact solution methodology is proposed. The proposed solution method lends itself to container load relaxation, temporal decomposition, and valid cut generation. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated via a real-life problem faced by a large 3PL provider. A computation study is carried out to investigate the proposed method's sensitivity to key factors such as the demand structure, delivery time windows, number of gateways and the consolidation cost breakpoints.}

The scope of the game is to provide a platform where the participants will produce the right product at the right time. The participants, who are non-experts and may have different educational backgrounds were divided into six roles/departments: Operator, Production Managers, Logistics, Circular Economy, Service Technician, and Game Observer. Role cards, given to each group, at the beginning of the game, stating the responsible areas and the task descriptions. By introducing new Industry 4.0 technologies, by a deck of game cards, continually in the game, e.g., collaborate robots, data mining, analysis tools, and reconfiguring manufacturing systems, the participants gain first-hand experience on how these technologies influence the production but also on the impact of needed qualifications and management of the production. The game cards may introduce disruptions, e.g., errors of process or conveyors, to create awareness of a weakness in the production and how vital adaptability is in the production. The game received favorable reviews from both participants from the industry and the education domain. Through the experience in the AAU Smart Production lab, the participants gain an understanding of the complexity of a holistic approach. They gain awareness and get inspired on the various ways that different technologies may be integrated and create impact across several traditional functions. As main outcome of this game we highlight the need for an interdisciplinary approach for utilizing Industry 4.0 technologies.}

However, biomass preprocessing operations could be decentralized by moving the preprocessing operations to distributed biomass preprocessing centers, also known as “depots” located near biomass sources. This study presents a comparative case study with multiple biomass resources to analyze biorefinery feedstock supply logistics designs having distributed depots and a primary depot co-located with the biorefinery. A mixed-integer linear programming model was developed to simultaneously optimize feedstock sourcing decisions, and optimal preprocessing depot locations and size, utilizing biomass resources from agricultural residue, energy and municipal solid waste to meet carbohydrate specifications and feedstock demand for a biochemical conversion process. Results from a case study in the US showed that a biorefinery could increase its feedstock supply draw area and supply volume by 57.3%, 177.4% respectively without increasing the feedstock delivered cost by adopting distributed depot-in the feedstock supply chain design. A distributed-depot-based supply chain can be more economical by selecting optimal mix of biomass resource, optimal siting and depot scales during feedstock supply chain design. The findings from this study indicate that a biorefinery can utilize dynamic blending to meet the feedstock quality specifications as well as larger supply radius in the distributed depot-based supply chain design to access more available biomass to handle potential feedstock supply uncertainty.}

This analysis is very popular in the domains of urban governance, transportation engineering, logistics and geospatial information services for individuals or industrials. Importantly, data models of moving objects are one of the most crucial approaches to support the analysis for dynamic relative motion between moving objects, even in the age of big data and cloud computing. Traditional geographic information systems (GIS) usually organize moving objects as point objects in absolute coordinated space. The derivation of relative motions among moving objects is not efficient because of the additional geo-computation of transformation between absolute space and relative space. Therefore, current GISs require an innovative approach to directly store, analyze and interpret the relative relationships of moving objects to support their efficient analysis. This paper proposes a relative space-based GIS data model of moving objects (RSMO) to construct, operate and analyze moving objects’ relationships and introduces two algorithms (relationship querying and relative relationship dynamic pattern matching) to derive and analyze the dynamic relationships of moving objects. Three scenarios (epidemic spreading, tracker finding, and motion-trend derivation of nearby crowds) are implemented to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed model. The experimental results indicates the execution times of the proposed model are approximately 5–50% those of the absolute GIS method for the same function of these three scenarios. It’s better computational performance of the proposed model when analyzing the relative relationships of moving objects than the absolute methods in a famous commercial GIS software based on this experimental results. The proposed approach fills the gap of traditional GIS and shows promise for relative space-based geo-computation, analysis and service.}

With about 85.7% of Ghana's population without access to decent toilet facilities as of 2017, Ghana ranks highly in the world among countries with poor human waste management practices. Focusing on urban Ghana, the purpose of this article is twofold: first, to analyze the social, economic, institutional and cultural factors inhibiting the provision of household toilet facility in urban Ghana; and second, to assess how urban residents are coping with the absence of in-house toilet facilities, and the urban planning implications. Using Wa municipality as a case study, household survey and key informant interviews were conducted. Findings indicate that provision of in-house toilet facilities is influenced by complex interactions of socio-economic (e.g. income and educational levels) and cultural (community belief system in relation to toilet provision) factors as well as distortions in the urban planning regime (e.g. limited monitoring systems, inadequate logistics and personnel). Findings from a regression analysis between residents’ attitudes to provision of toilet facilities and the benefits they receive or derive from the availability and/use of in-house toilet facilities indicated a positive correlation (correlation coefficient 0.750; degrees of freedom 13; p value 0.001), yet residents have resorted to the use of communal toilet facilities, open defecation and ‘perching’ (i.e. sharing with friends’ with in-house toilet facilities). Implications of the findings for environmental planning are discussed.}

Empirical estimates of wave exposure within these zones are limited by logistical constraints and/or cost. Hydrodynamic models of wave action poorly resolve fine-scale heterogeneity in wave energetics that are important for biology. We used cost-effective accelerometers to continuously measure fine-scale wave exposure across 12 locations (i.e., two depth strata at each of six sites), over sixteen consecutive months. We categorised wave exposure at each of our sites a priori (as ‘exposed’ or ‘sheltered’) based on shore topography. We compared in situ measurements of acceleration with a nearby wave rider buoy and evaluated variation in water acceleration and frequency of large wave events among sites and between depths. Wave height data significantly correlated with accelerometer data confirming accelerometers sufficiently measure wave action. Our analyses indicate significant fine-scale variation in acceleration, and differences in timing and frequency of large wave events during the study period. In situ acceleration had limited correspondence with shore-based (a priori) assessments of wave exposure. These results demonstrate the spatial and temporal differences in water acceleration on the Wellington south coast and highlight the limitations of surface topography to predict fine-scale wave action. This study also emphasizes the need for fine scale wave action measurements to better explain patterns in intertidal/shallow subtidal organism traits.}

abstract = {Paddy straw is an abundantly available lignocellulosic biomass in Southern and South-Eastern Asia, which remains in surplus. The surplus straw is either burnt in the farms or dumped openly to get the farms evacuated for next crop, which not only creates the environmental pollution but also loses the potential energy source. It is a vital source of renewable energy and is considered to mitigate the global dependency on fossil fuels by producing sustainable biofuels. Anaerobic digestion is one of the biochemical conversion routes, which utilizes paddy straw for biogas production, and reduces the environmental pollution by preventing straw burning and generating carbon-neutral biofuel. This review paper is focused on anaerobic digestion process as one of the most cost-efficient alternatives for utilization of surplus paddy straw to produce biogas as gaseous biofuel. However, anaerobic digestion of paddy straw faces challenges of relatively low methane yield, high retention time, and instability of anaerobic digestion system due to its recalcitrant structural composition, unbalanced nutrients, and lack of efficient inoculum. These challenges could be conquered by different strategies viz pretreatment of paddy straw, co-digestion with other organic matters, selection of effective inoculum sources, and optimization of process parameters. Thus, the present review highlights the environmental impact and biomethane potential of paddy straw, major challenges and their solutions to enhance the biodigestibility, and factors responsible for process stability. Lastly, few approaches to attain the process sustainability by adopting efficient supply-chain logistics and future advanced technologies have also been discussed.}

abstract = {An urban underground freight transport system (UFTS) can be an alternative for relieving the pressure of traffic congestion, reducing carbon emissions and breaking the bottlenecks of logistics transportation. The construction and operation of UFTSs require many resources invested at early stages, while the resources provided in each city are limited. Properly creating an environmentally friendly UFTS under finite resources is a prerequisite for effective reduction of the carbon emissions generated by freight transportation and is a key basis for guidance regarding operations management and network expansion. The main goal of the present research study is to develop an optimal resources allocation strategy to reduce carbon emissions by using a bi-level programming model under the finite construction resources of an UFTS. Thus, an optimal resources allocation method was developed to optimize carbon dioxide emissions in an integrated network of roads and UFTS under finite construction resources. This method integrates the characteristics of carbon emissions in UFTS and road transportation, together with a relationship between construction resources and initial design speed. Due to the nonconvexity and discreteness of the question, we transform the bi-level programming model to a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model to obtain the optimum resource allocation strategy by linearizing the constraints and objective functions. The freight network between the Xiongan New Area and Beijing is taken as an example to verify the superiority of the model. The influences of the changes in resource quantities and typical strategies of transport time, freight volume in a UFTS and rotation volume of freight transport are analyzed, which provides a foundation for further study of the implementation of UFTSs in reality.}

In this regard, this paper presents a multi-objective robust stochastic mixed integer linear programming model for an integrated platelet supply chain considering unidirectional lateral transshipment between hospitals and clinics. In the proposed model, platelets are divided into typical, irradiated and washed platelets with lifespan differentiated for various types of patients. This model evaluates the risk of inappropriate production by concentrating on three different procedures for extracting platelet, including apheresis, platelet rich plasma and buffy coat methods. In this investigation, staff errors, laboratory hygiene and device failure, as well as donors' blood contamination, are considered for obtaining the function of inappropriate production rate. In our model, the logistics costs are considered as the first objective and the maximum unsatisfied demand as the second objective, both also to be minimized. To tackle demand uncertainty, a robust stochastic approach is then developed. Afterwards, to create a more realistic model, the Monte Carlo sampling approach is used for generating required scenarios. Finally, some managerial insights are provided through a real case study to evaluate the applicability of the presented model. The results indicate that the proposed model not only improves the demand satisfaction but also reduces the risk of itemized platelets wastage.}

DBS and DPS are of particular interest to Li + TDM for allowing the estimation of Li + erythrocyte levels. Thus, the aim of this study was to develop and validate an assay for the determination of Li+ in DBS and DPS by Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (GFAAS), and to evaluate its application in a clinical setting. Li+ was extracted from one 8 mm DBS disc punch with nitric acid 4.5% and from one 6 mm DPS disc punch with diluent solution (HNO3 1% + Triton 0.1%) and injected into GFAAS. The method was applied to Li + TDM in 43 patients with mood disorder. The assays were linear from 0.10 to 3.0 mEq L−1 (r > 0.99), precise, with CV 3.6–7.2% for DBS and 4.6–9.3% for DPS samples, and accurate, with accuracy values of 97–109% and 98–106% for DBS and DPS samples, respectively. Li+ was stable in dried samples during twenty days at up to 42 °C. The DBS assay accuracy and recovery were not influenced by blood hematocrit. The patients presented Li + serum concentrations of 0.18–1.1 mEq L−1 and 0.17 to 0.92 mEq L−1 in DBS and 0.15 to 0.99 mEq L−1 in DPS samples. DPS had comparable Li + concentrations to the ones found in fresh serum samples. With DBS samples it was possible to estimate the Li + erythrocyte to plasma concentration ratio (LiR). The findings of this study support the clinical application of DBS and DPS samples for the TDM of Li+.}

Four learning objectives guided the activity and addressed learner ability to: critique individual team communication performance using selected sections of the Interprofessional Collaborator Assessment Rubric (ICAR)1, demonstrate at least two specific communication skills while participating in the activity, share a list of the patient/family goals for end-of-life care, and propose at least three different strategies that could be used in their future practice to facilitate effective interprofessional care delivery. Faculty used a grading rubric to assess learner achievement of the four learning objectives. A mixed methods approach evaluated the effectiveness of the activity and effect on self-reported learner attitudes and future practice. This educational resource was an effective, accessible, and low-risk learning modality for advancing interprofessional competencies in education for practice. Teaching strategies that emphasize situated learning and reflective learning support interprofessional competency development. Use of virtual reality technologies engages learners in realistic scenarios in a safe environment free from the risk of harm to patients and families, allowing small groups of learners to meet synchronously online, and providing an alternative to face-to-face synchronous scheduling of multiple health professions disciplines, thus reducing strain on program budgets and scheduling logistics.

abstract = {Objectives
The aim of this retrospective study is to compare surgical margins, reoperation rates and local recurrences after breast conserving surgery (BCS) using radioguided occult lesion localization (ROLL) or radioactive seed localization (RSL).
Materials and methods
We reviewed 744 consecutive patients with impalpable primary invasive breast cancer who underwent BCS at Helsinki University Hospital between 2010 and 2012. ROLL was used in our unit until October 31st, 2011; from November 1st we changed localization method to RSL.
Results
318 patients underwent ROLL and 426 RSL. Patients in the RSL group had more often multifocal (p = 0.013) tumours. No statistically significant differences were found regarding tumour size, specimen weight, histology or grade of tumours or lymph node status. 42 (5.6%) patients were reoperated because of insufficient margins, 13 (4.1%) in the ROLL group and 29 (6.8%) in the RSL group. The reoperation rate was not different between the groups either in the univariable analysis (p = 0.112) or in the multivariable binary logistic regression analysis (p = 0.204). Risk factors for reoperations were multifocality of the tumour (p < 0.001), extensive intraductal component (p < 0.001), larger tumour size (p = 0.011), and smaller specimen weight (p = 0.014). The median follow-up time in the ROLL group was 81 (8–94) months and 64 (3–73) months in the RSL group. The five-year local recurrence-free survival (LRFS) estimates for ROLL and RSL groups were 98.0% and 99.4%, respectively (log-rank test, p = 0.323).
Conclusion
Reoperation rates and LRFS were comparable for ROLL and RSL in patients with impalpable breast cancer treated with BCS.}

abstract = {Recent studies in maritime logistics have introduced a general ship routing problem and a benchmark suite based on real shipping segments, considering pickups and deliveries, cargo selection, ship-dependent starting locations, travel times and costs, time windows, and incompatibility constraints, among other features. Together, these characteristics pose considerable challenges for exact and heuristic methods, and some cases with as few as 18 cargoes remain unsolved. To face this challenge, we propose an exact branch-and-price (B&P) algorithm and a hybrid metaheuristic. Our exact method generates elementary routes, but exploits decremental state-space relaxation to speed up column generation, heuristic strong branching, as well as advanced preprocessing and route enumeration techniques. Our metaheuristic is a sophisticated extension of the unified hybrid genetic search. It exploits a set-partitioning phase and uses problem-tailored variation operators to efficiently handle all the problem characteristics. As shown in our experimental analyses, the B&P optimally solves 239/240 existing instances within one hour. Scalability experiments on even larger problems demonstrate that it can optimally solve problems with around 60 ships and 200 cargoes (i.e., 400 pickup and delivery services) and find optimality gaps below 1.04% on the largest cases with up to 260 cargoes. The hybrid metaheuristic outperforms all previous heuristics and produces near-optimal solutions within minutes. These results are noteworthy, since these instances are comparable in size with the largest problems routinely solved by shipping companies.}

In this regard, the growth stages of grapes play important roles in the evaluation of vineyard production throughout the season. Predicted yield maps allow growers to view spatial variability across fields and to determine the best harvesting time and marketing strategy. Different methods are used to estimate yield; however, large-scale estimation is difficult due to labor and time requirements. Machine learning and satellite remote sensing have the potential to obtain quick and rapid assessments over large areas with lower costs and in shorter timeframes. In this context, the purpose of this research was to develop yield prediction models based on a machine-learning approach using satellite-based time-series images. In this study, Landsat 8 surface reflectance products from 2017, 2018 and 2019 were used to map the satellite-based normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), leaf area index (LAI) and normalized difference water index (NDWI). Moreover, different growth stages were observed using moving averages and exponential smoothing methods based on the per-pixel values from the satellite imagery. The vegetation indices had particularly close relationships with each other at the time of maximum canopy expansion. To remove the seasonality of the vegetation indices, a moving average was applied to determine one representative mean for each vineyard. The generated models were validated using regression analysis and an artificial neural network (ANN) approach. The results indicated that of all the vegetation indices, NDVI had the highest accuracy (r2 = 0.79) in 2017 and 2019; however, the LAI accuracy was higher than the accuracies of the other indices (r2 = 0.79) in 2019. Nevertheless, the artificial neural network-based machine learning results indicated that NDVI had the highest accuracy in 2017 (R = 0.94), 2018 (R = 0.95) and 2019 (R = 0.92) among all the vegetation indices. Thus, machine learning achieved reliable grape yield monitoring across the studied years at local and regional levels. Ground reference yield datasets were used for comparison with the predicted yields. The findings suggest that vegetation indices can be used for calculating site-specific management of vineyards and for predicting yields. The machine-learning methods applied with satellite time-series images can achieve reliable table grape yield prediction models. These integrated models could be used for logistics and decision-making regarding table grape production.}

A number of novel concepts focusing on intelligent logistics and packaging systems are being developed and tested in the food industry, all over the world. Several of these concepts predict quality and product safety of foods for use along the food supply chain (FSC) by the food industry, distributors, and retailers, as well as consumers. In this chapter, the focus is set on models and technologies related to increased transparency and visibility in FSCs for the purpose of lowering food waste, increasing food safety, and increasing overall resource efficiency. An overview of models and concepts for transparency with specific emphasis on food monitoring systems and technologies is presented, together with an in-depth field study of an industry case. The field study covers a whole supply chain in which all actors were provided with real-time data on time and temperature of a product from production until consumption. It is concluded that the use of new technologies holds great potential and huge value in collecting and sharing quality data. However, the main challenges are found in the business relationships where the risks and willingness to share information, i.e., of being more transparent, are the major hurdles in the development of sustainable food supply chains.}
