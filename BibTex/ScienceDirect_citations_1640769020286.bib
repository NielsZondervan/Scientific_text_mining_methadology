In this paper, we review recent studies that develop CA models for transportation, distribution and logistics problems with the aim of synthesizing recent advancements and identifying current research gaps. This survey focuses on important principles and key results from CA models. In particular, we consider how these studies fill the gaps identified by the most recent literature reviews in this field. We observe that CA models are used in a wider range of applications, especially in the areas of facility location and integrated supply chain management. Most studies use CA as an alternative and a complement to discrete solution approaches; however, CA can also be used in combination with discrete approaches. We conclude with promising areas of future work.}

abstract = {The National Policy of Solid Waste, recently approved in Brazil, establishes the implementation of reverse logistics networks for several residues, such as electronic waste. One of the primary points of the legislation is the principle of ‘shared responsibility’, which establishes that all actors in a supply chain are responsible for the reverse logistics, such as manufacturers, distributors, importers, retailers, the government and the final consumer. This situation characterizes a group decision context and, emphasises the need of aggregate different and often conflicting viewpoints. Thus, this paper proposes the use of a specific Problem Structuring Method, the Strategic Options Development Analysis, which is based on the construction of cognitive mapping techniques, for developing strategic analysis based on the decision-makers' viewpoints. In order to apply the methodology, we conducted online workshops with 8 representatives of the stakeholders involved in this decision context. At the end of the process, four categories of actions to be implemented were found and developed: strategic, environmental, economic and social. These categories are based not only to technically assessment, but also on stakeholder's perspectives. The contribution of this paper is mainly related to the analysis and structuration of the problem of reverse logistics of electronic waste under a problem structuring methodology, which is few explored in the literature. This paper also contributes to researchers estudying reverse logistics of electronic waste, mainly in developing countries.}

abstract = {Industry is facing an era characterised by unpredictable market changes and by a turbulent competitive environment. The key to compete in such a context is to achieve high degrees of responsiveness by means of high flexibility and rapid reconfiguration capabilities. The deployment of modular solutions seems to be part of the answer to face these challenges. Semantic modelling and ontologies may represent the needed knowledge representation to support flexibility and modularity of production systems, when designing a new system or when reconfiguring an existing one. Although numerous ontologies for production systems have been developed in the past years, they mainly focus on discrete manufacturing, while logistics aspects, such as those related to internal logistics and warehousing, have not received the same attention. The paper aims at offering a representation of logistics aspects, reflecting what has become a de-facto standard terminology in industry and among researchers in the field. Such representation is to be used as an extension to the already-existing production systems ontologies that are more focused on manufacturing processes. The paper presents the structure of the hierarchical relations within the examined internal logistics elements, namely Storage and Transporters, structuring them in a series of classes and sub-classes, suggesting also the relationships and the attributes to be considered to complete the modelling. Finally, the paper proposes an industrial example with a miniload system to show how such a modelling of internal logistics elements could be instanced in the real world.}

The efficiency of logistics networks, in its turn, depends on government services, investments, and policies. Building infrastructure, developing a regulatory regime for transport services, and designing and implementing efficient customs clearance procedures are the areas where governments play an important role. One of the measures for logistics performance at national level is the Logistics Performance Index (LPI) published by the World Bank Group. LPI is composed of six indicators namely customs, infrastructure, service quality, timeliness, international shipments, and tracking and tracing. This study argues that there is a close relationship between global competitiveness and the logistics efficiency of a country and it analyzes the validity of these relations using an artificial neural network (ANN) and cumulative belief degrees (CBD) approach. For this purpose; initially, a screening process is carried out to find the World Economic Forum’s competitiveness indicators that may have an impact on each of the LPI indicators. Subsequently, the relationship between the competitiveness indicators and LPI indicators is analyzed using ANN where the LPI indicators are represented by CBDs. As a case study, this methodology is used to analyze Turkey’s logistics performance and to develop the basic strategies to be adopted by the government to achieve a targeted LPI level for the country. Among the many factors relating to logistics performance, it was found that fixed broadband Internet availability is the most important target area for improvement related to sustainable logistics policy.}

Using the 1980–2010 data, we examine the historical evolution of energy consumption in China’s logistics industry. The logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) method was used to analyze the key factors that drove the chronicle changes in logistics energy consumption in China. Changes in energy consumption of China’s logistics industry are attributed to growth in logistics activity, modal shift in freight transportation, increases in transport intensity, and overall improvements in energy intensity: (1) China’s logistics industry enjoyed fast growth with an average annual growth rate of 9.65% from 1980 to 2010. Increase in logistics activity has been the major force driving up logistics energy consumption (accounting for 48.8% of logistics energy increase); (2) Logistics energy consumption increased by 22.91 times, averaging at 11.9% growth per year. Fuel consumption in highway transportation has become more dominant in logistics energy consumption; (3) While changes in logistics activities, transportation modes and transport intensity pushed up logistics energy consumptions, improvements in energy intensity helped significantly to curb the energy rise in China’s logistics industry.}

This paper focuses on how the parameters of inserted orders affect the position of the CODP when a logistics service integrator (LSI) is operating a mass customization logistics service. Considering customer demand for orders to be inserted, a CODP decision model for LSSCs is developed based on a two-echelon LSSC consisting of an LSI and several customers. The objectives of the model are to maximize the profit and to ensure the comprehensive satisfaction of the LSI. Conducting numerical analyses on a specific dataset, it was discovered that the scale effect coefficient and service volume of the inserted order have a clear influence on the CODP decision, while the order variation coefficient does not. Furthermore, the LSI will not accept an inserted order when the inserted order has a high variation coefficient or a low price.}

However, we know little about logistics outsourcing, especially with regard to opportunistic behavior types and their relational antecedents (e.g., contracts and relational norms) of their opportunism in the third party logistics (3PL) user-provider relationships in emerging economies. Using China's developing 3PL industry as a research context, and social exchange theory and transaction cost economics as the theoretical lenses, we examine how three dimensions of relational norms (information exchange, flexibility, solidarity) influence two dimensions of contracts (detailed contracts, contract application), and how relational norms and contracts simultaneously influence 3PL providers’ opportunism. Using data collected from 247 manufacturing and service firms in China, we empirically test the proposed model and find that detailed contracts and solidarity are effective safeguards in reducing 3PL providers’ opportunistic behavior, while the contract application process leads to opportunism. Furthermore, flexibility is positively related to detailed contracts and the contract application process, which can influence 3PL providers’ opportunism negatively and positively, respectively. This study contributes to the logistics outsourcing, opportunism, and relationship management literature and provides managerial implications for 3PL practices in China.}

The objectives of the study were to investigate on what makes the users of logistics service satisfied among the collectivist societies. Qualitative research was deployed, whereby the main data were collected by using face-to-face interviews using semi-structured interviews. Four logistics service providers and three logistics service users (manufacturers) were interviewed. Data were transcribed and analysed by identifying the theme and patterns with the aim to understand the preset and emerging theories. The findings showed that in achieving customer satisfaction in Malaysia's context, operational technical ability within the logistics service quality (LSQ), such as timeliness and service condition, is a basic element contributing to satisfaction subject to influence of cultural values. The emerging elements provide the key insights on the elements and sub-elements which lead to satisfaction in the context of Malaysian logistics service users. Rather than the organization's performance-related factors, the results revealed that within the Malaysian national cultural context, there are influences of cultural elements towards customer satisfaction.}

This paper optimizes straw power plant layouts (both in terms of location and scale) in Jiangsu Province to minimize the logistics costs while meeting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction goals. Results show that the logistics mode has important effects on the optimal scale and logistics costs but a minimal influence on the site selection, based on the comparison of two typical logistics modes in the study area, namely, the RPM and the SCM. In the RPM, the optimal logistics cost is 14.38 USD/Mg, which is 49.6% greater than that in the SCM. Moreover, the optimal location and production scale at each site are very sensitive to changes in GHG emissions reduction goals. Changes in GHG emissions reduction goals can significantly affect the logistics costs and straw supply, which may increase the operation risk of straw power generation plants. We suggest that the logistics mode and the GHG emissions reduction goals should be carefully designed when constructing new bioenergy plants, and technological innovation with respect to harvest and compression machinery before transportation should be promoted to improve economic performance and reduce GHG emissions throughout the entire system without changing the locations of existing plants.}

The optimization objectives of the model include minimizing the average unit operation cost for the LSI and maximizing the average satisfaction of the FLSPs. In order to verify the viability of our model, with specific data derived from the daily scheduling operation records of the Baoyun Logistics Company, we perform a numerical analysis using genetic algorithms based on multiple datasets where a single parameter is changed each time while the other parameters remain unchanged. The results show that the CODP moves earlier with the increase of the volume of new order. Furthermore, as the new order's similarity coefficient increases or the new order's completion time requirement is relaxed, the CODP moves later in the LSSC. With a given similarity coefficient or time patience variance related to the new order, the maximum insertion volume decreases and the CODP moves later in the LSSC.}

abstract = {Economic growth of a nation depends upon its capability to ensure the security of safe and quality food to its citizens. Despite having the vital role of food security in the growth, emerging economies are facing a number of challenges in their food logistics system. One of the most attention-seeking challenges is the management of security and safety of food commodities in food logistics. The prime concern is to monitor food quality throughout its supply chain and track the physical movement till it reaches end-consumers. This requires implementation of an effective and efficient traceability system. The successful implementation of traceability system requires consideration of multiple stakeholders’ perspectives. On the basis of critical success factor (CSF) theory and multiple stakeholders’ view on ensuring the security of quality food, this study proposes a comprehensive framework for implementation of traceability-based food logistics system. It attempts to identify and classify various CSFs necessary for the implementation of traceability system using a questionnaire-based survey followed by exploratory factor analysis. Further, an analysis of inter-relationships among the statistically significant CSFs is performed using total interpretive structural modeling, which considers multiple stakeholders’ views. The study helps in developing a comprehensive understanding of directional inter-relationships among CSFs and provides significant insights related to ways to improve consumer satisfaction through safe and quality food in food logistics.}

Diversified logistics demand leads to a variety of truck trip purpose, to study truck related emissions by trip purpose is necessary. This study aims to analyze the characteristics of trucking activities in a ULN by trip purpose and to investigate the relationships between trucks' trip emissions and critical influential factors from a ULN perspective, with a particularly focuses on the effects of the Euclidean distance of a trip, the vehicle curb weight, as well as the population density at a trip's origin/destination (OD). By combining a large set of empirical GPS trucking data and analytical information of ULN properties from Shenzhen, China, an imputation matrix approach is first developed to classify the truck data, based on trip purposes. Then, the trucking characteristics in terms of each trip purpose are extracted from the processed data. The GHG emissions associated with the trucking activities are estimated using a variant of the comprehensive modal emissions model (CMEM). A multivariate regression analysis is conducted to independently and quantitatively identify whether the critical factors vary in terms of a trip's purpose and to establish how such factors impact on GHG emissions. These results suggesting that designing emission management measures should take such purposes into consideration. The significant of OD Euclidean distance and the vehicle curb weight may vary by trip purpose, while the OD population density could also be regarded as an underlying determinant of most trip purposes. The results can be extended to other cities with similar classifications of trip purposes in their ULNs, thereby providing a decision-support tool for governmental policies and regulations, the locations of logistics facilities, and operational plans for trucks.}

Due to the complexity of the logistics industry, better coordination among all relevant parties are challenging. The purpose of this research is to analyze the key factors on the coordinated development between metropolitan economy and logistics. This paper uses a Bayesian Network to examine their impacts. Several contributions are significant. Firstly, it is observed that the coordinated development of metropolitan economy and logistics heavily relies on their development levels as their posterior probability values are both over 80%. Secondly, two causation chains greatly affected the coordinated development are found. Scientific value of this research is that special attentions should be paid to key factors like logistics infrastructure investment, the development level of logistics industry, basic research and development level, and the technological development level within the chains when carrying out sustainable decision-makings.}

We adopt a two-stage robust optimization approach where location decisions are made before and recourse decisions are made after the disruptions are known. We construct three two-stage robust models, which are solved exactly by a column-and-constraint-generation algorithm. Numerical tests demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the Benders decomposition method in both solution quality and computational time, and that the system’s reliability can be improved with only a slight increase in the normal cost.}

Considerations are made on the role and importance of Logistics within a company, its cost structure and the strategic relevance it assumes within the Supply-Chain, while considering its evolution from a Physical Distribution Management to a Supply-Chain Management. The increasing importance of logistics requires more sophisticated solutions to reduce or optimize its costs, as well as to find new opportunities to redesign the network configuration and the value-chain. These applications require a careful evaluation method in order to assess their effective adoption. The research is based on a literature review of the most relevant European Road ITS and C-ITS projects evaluation methods and benefits. The result of the investigation is an analysis that classifies the impact of C-ITS on the structure of the Supply-Chain according to different levels. Firstly, the paper reports the different impacts of a large-scale C-ITS deployment on the Logistics cost structure of a company and more in general, on the expected costs. After that, a second level of analysis deals with a possible redesign of the Distribution Network, oriented to the optimization of transportation costs over long distances. Finally, the third step of the analysis investigates a possible impact of C-ITS on the value-chain from several perspectives within the different roles of the subjects involved in the Supply Chain.}

It uses a contingency theory to claim that, under different environmental conditions, logistics flexibility and relationship flexibility for a focal firm (a manufacturer in this study) will have distinct effects on logistics service quality (when treated as a controllable mediator) and the firm's satisfaction in its relationship with its key downstream account. Using data from a survey of manufacturers in China, it uses structural equation modeling to test the main effects and moderated regression together with moderated path analysis to examine the contingent effects of environmental uncertainty. The results show that, as distinctive capabilities, both logistics flexibility and relationship flexibility have significant positive effects on the level of logistics service quality that the manufacturer offers, which, in turn, enhance how much it values and is satisfied with its relationship with its key account. However, the direct effect of logistics flexibility on relationship satisfaction is stronger under an uncertain environment, while the direct and total effect of relationship flexibility on relationship satisfaction is stronger under a stable environment.}

Running a business plan, in which companies take responsibility for the waste generated at their end-of-life products, involves making important strategic decisions. One of the challenges in planning the reverse flow of products is decide where installing the reprocessing facilities. This decision influences directly the transport variables costs and the facilities installation fixed costs. This paper proposes a model for the Capacitated Plant Location Problem in Reverse Logistics (CPL-RL), in which we assume that offered material in each collection center is aimed at a single facility for reprocessing. This restriction includes specific cases where there is no logistic availability in the network to send the collected material to different locations. The Mixed Integer Problem (MILP) is solved using an algorithm in two steps. In the first step, reduction tests are performed, which ones determine a priori which facilities are opened/closed. If all facilities are fixed opened or closed then the solution is optimal. Although not all facilities can have their status defined that way, the resultant problem has a less number of variables and it is solved using Benders method. The dataset was randomly generated and the results showed that the applied techniques are appropriate, achieving the optimal solution for all test problems.}

This paper investigates a use case in the maintenance of assets ("jigs") for the transport of wing covers produced by a transnational aeronautics OEM. Based on the analysis of the application case, it derives the requirements towards a predictive maintenance system and projects them onto current state of the art standards like MIMOSA OSA-CBM and RAMI4.0. From this a unified predictive maintenance system for the optimization of jig maintenance procedures is proposed and initial results in the form of the application of a conceptual architecture to the problems identified in the use case are presented.}

This paper presents collaborative concepts developed for reducing road transportation and congestion and improving urban logistics and mobility by implementing alternative solutions (combination of road with waterborne and rail) in a region. A simulation tool is used for describing actual situation of a city. Then this model is analyzed and scenarios containing alternative solutions are proposed.

abstract = {The integration of manufacturing and logistics has drawn widespread research attentions in recent years. This paper focuses on the Synchronized Production and Logistics (SPL), which is operational level integration. SPL　is defined as synchronizing the processing, moving and storing of raw material, WIP and finished product within one manufacturing unit by high level information sharing and joint scheduling to achieve synergic decision, execution and overall performance improvement. Through analysing the requirements and challenges in real life industry, the ubiquitous computing is adopted as an enabling technology and an Ubi-SPL (Synchronized Production and Logistics via Ubiquitous Technology) framework is proposed. This framework is consists of four layers, which creates a close decision-execution loop by linking the frontline real time data, user feedback and optimized decision together. A real life case study of applying Ubi-SPL solution in a chemical industry has been conducted. The implementation results show that the proposed Ubi-SPL solution can significantly improve the overall performance in both production and logistics service.}

abstract = {This paper examines the influence of oil price shocks on the financial performance of logistics service providers. By applying the structural vector auto regression (SVAR) methodology to the data of 301 logistics service providers (LSPs) from 2004 to 2014, based on annual and half-yearly report data (in total 6020 firm-years), it is shown that oil price changes are absorbed in a variety of ways by different types of companies. Fluctuations in oil prices negatively affect the transportation industry – with minor restrictions in asset-light clusters and companies which consume little to no oil. Our analysis also shows that oil price shocks result in effects of different magnitude and length with respect to the type of LSP. Thus, some LSP clusters adapt quicker to oil price changes than others and are better able to absorb price shocks. An innovative approach is applied to examine LSP performance; SVAR, a widespread model in economics, is used to analyse the LSP sector. The results are important for financial planning of the management of different LSP types as well as their customers.}

The authors present the MAMCA as a method which structures the consultation process of stakeholders. This approach was tested in a workshop in Brussels and the paper uses that consultation process as an illustration of the methodology. That application demonstrated the benefits of the MAMCA to ensure a productive workshop. The methodology allows the authorities to especially identify the priorities of the stakeholders in city logistics, to guide the discussion towards a consensus and to provide inputs for an eventual adaptation of the strategies.}

abstract = {The degradation of the environment, caused in part by end of life and end of used products, necessitates the set-up of recovery networks. These networks may be owned by the manufacturer or they can be outsourced to third parties. Most manufacturers prefer outsourcing, so this study proposes a benchmarked recovery process for third party reverse logistics providers (3PRLP) by evaluating design criteria, implementation criteria, process control characteristics, and business orientation policies. Expertise efficiency of third party providers dictates their competitiveness and/or survival. In an effort to help third parties enhance value recovery from the process in the market, this paper seeks to establish a meaningful benchmark that will dictate best practices through quality function deployment (QFD). In particular, the paper offers a theoretical background to measure the relative importance among the various types of criteria. The proposed technique also helps to establish guidelines by which to prioritize the various characteristics. This study finds that the main driving factor regarding waste management centers on mandatory laws. It also concludes that when government relaxes its policies, environmentally oriented businesses are able to strengthen their systems.}

abstract = {Efficiency of construction site layout planning (CSLP) and construction material logistics planning (CMLP) is of great significance for a successful project control. Despite considerable research undertaken to separately optimize the site layout plan or material logistics plan, the interdependencies and decision conflicts of the layout planner and the logistics planner are neglected in the construction planning and design phase. The ignorance of the decision conflicts and interdependencies can lead to an overrun cost, a delayed project or a worse quality. This research proposes a decentralized methodology based on a bi-level model and a Bi-PSO algorithm, enabling the layout planner and the logistics planner to optimize the CSLP and the CMLP in an integrated model. Fuzzy random parameters are utilized to deal with uncertainty in the data collection process. By utilizing the methodology, the stakeholders are capable of adjusting the respective decisions based on the changes of others. By iteratively adjusting the CSLP and CMLP solutions, the CSLP-CMLP decision conflicts are dealt with, accordingly, the bi-stakeholder conflict resolution-motivated CSLP-CMLP strategy is planned. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed methodology, a real case study is conducted to optimize CSLP and CMLP simultaneously. The significance of optimizing an integrated CSLP-CMLP for the layout planner, the logistics planner and the general contractor is also justified. The contributions of this research include the capability of modeling the decision conflicts in a bi-level model, the ability of generating an integrated CSLP-CMLP solution and the practicality of guiding academic researchers and practitioners to optimize construction management from a global viewpoint. The research can be extended to other fields to explore the effects of decentralized decision making on other bi-stakeholder conflict resolution cases.}

Building on transaction cost theory, we develop the hypothesis that integration decreases to cope with supply volatility and technology uncertainty, and increases to cope with demand volatility and legal unenforceability. These four interrelated yet distinct characteristics jointly describe environmental uncertainties in a logistics outsourcing relationship. Our analysis of 264 such relationships suggests that integration does decrease with supply volatility and technology uncertainty and increase with demand volatility and legal unenforceability. By enhancing operational performance, integration improves outsourcing performance in terms of both financial performance and overall satisfaction. Lastly, operational performance also contributes to financial performance.}

abstract = {Reverse logistics is a primary component of green supply chain management initiatives and is often analysed from a broad perspective. Rooted in the resource-based view of the firm, this empirical study decomposes reverse logistics into five commonly adopted disposition options (repair, recondition, remanufacture, recycle, and disposal) to examine the effects of using each option on measures of environmental performance, profitability, and sales growth. Considering institutional theory, this study also investigates the moderating role of both regulatory and ownership pressure on the relationship between each reverse logistics disposition option and levels of performance. Using survey data collected from managers at 89 ISO14001 certified electrical and electronic equipment manufacturing firms, regression models test a series of hypothesized relationships. Results suggest that under the presence of institutional pressure, use of disposition options results in increased levels of performance in some cases. The recovery of valuable components during product recondition and remanufacture activities contributes to enhanced environmental and economic benefits. Conversely, product recycling and disposal activities are not necessarily performance-inducing initiatives in the face of regulatory pressures The findings of this study can be used to inform business decisions regarding the adoption and use of reverse logistics strategies. Legislative frameworks regarding extended producer responsibility are recommended in order to motivate the implementation of reverse logistics product disposition activities.}

Specifically, this work develops a hybrid content analytical model to scrutinize essential knowledge of e-commerce logistics. The empirical results of the proposed model incorporate theories of resource dependence theory (RDT) and innovation diffusion theory (IDT) to generate logistical strategies. Ten critical themes of e-commerce logistics from topic mining are “Southeast Asia’s e-commerce logistics payments”, “E-commerce order management”, “E-commerce logistics cloud services”, “E-commerce logistics package management”, “Europe e-commerce trends”, “India’s e-commerce logistics”, “E-commerce distribution management”, “Tax policies”, “E-commerce logistics platforms”, and “E-commerce logistics networks”. Moreover, the fundamental rule of “cross-border e-commerce logistics” is uncovered by the association rules model. The proposed hybrid content analytics framework provides a research foundation for e-commerce logistics management. Furthermore, e-commerce logistics can be implemented by vital strategies: “Establish inter-organizational and technical collaboration to create positive operations performance” and “Comprehend law, policy, and cultural differences to customize appropriate technologies of e-commerce logistics”.}

Such a definition however, loses meaning when considering purely dynamic problems where all customer requests arrive dynamically. Existing measures of dynamism are limited to either (1) measuring the proportion of online versus offline orders or (2) measuring urgency, a concept that is orthogonal to dynamism, instead. The present paper defines separate and independent formal definitions of dynamism and urgency applicable to purely dynamic problems. Using these formal definitions, instances of a dynamic logistic problem with varying levels of dynamism and urgency were constructed and several route scheduling algorithms were executed on these problem instances. Contrary to previous findings, the results indicate that dynamism is positively correlated with route quality; urgency, however, is negatively correlated with route quality. The paper contributes the theory that dynamism and urgency are two distinct concepts that deserve to be treated separately.}

Switchgrass is considered a potential feedstock in various states, including Tennessee, given its high biomass content in a wide range of environments. However, its low density relative to energy value and resulting high logistics costs impede the profitability of switchgrass-based bioenergy. The objective of this study is to determine the optimal logistics configuration for a collection/distribution hub to market Tennessee-produced switchgrass for bioenergy production. A mathematical programming model integrated with a geographic information system is used to maximize the net present value of profit from a hub that serves switchgrass producers and bioenergy markets. Six logistics configurations delivering switchgrass to local or international bioenergy markets are evaluated. The results highlight the economic challenges of penetrating energy markets for a switchgrass collection/distribution hub – only one logistics configuration that targets the local market is profitable. However, serving local and international markets becomes more feasible as investment risk declines. The results imply that a clear direction for national bioenergy policy is crucial to developing a biomass feedstock for the U.S. bioenergy industry.}

Efficiency improvement in this infield bale logistics will be beneficial. To address this an R simulation program involving five methods for field stack location, namely field middle, middle data range, centroid, geometric median, and medoid, as well as origin (a direct aggregation method to outlet), were developed. These methods were evaluated against field areas, ranging from 0.5 to 520 ha, for infield bale logistics (aggregation, transport, and total) using Euclidean distances. The simulation used several input field variables, laid out bales based on yield variation, determined optimized bale stack locations of methods, and evaluated distances of aggregation to the stack, transport from the stack to the outlet, and total logistics. The origin method used 1-bale handling tractor for direct aggregation to the outlet, while others formed the bale stacks and transported bales to the outlet using 6-bales/trip equipment. Results indicated for aggregation that geometric median was the best, followed by field middle or centroid, middle data range, medoid, and finally origin. Methods aggregation were about 76% and transport about 24% of the total (for > 2 ha); and total distance were about 65% of the origin. ANOVA, excluding origin, indicated that all methods were not significantly different (p < 0.05) for the areas studied. The ‘field middle’ was recommended as an easy and practical method for locating field stacks. Fitted power models described well (R2 > 0.99) all the logistics distances.}

Optimization of urban freight transport (UFT) can make an important contribution to the sustainability and livability of cities, conducing in the alleviation of traffic congestion and the mitigation of CO2 emissions and noise impacts. The detailed understanding of the causal effect of UFT measures on achieving sustainability of city logistics is the main scope of this paper. Life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA) is adopted to assess selected UFT measures by advancing the research in life cycle analysis (LCA) to city logistics processes. Focusing on administrative/regulatory schemes, strongly related to city typology, a scenario is evaluated and two indices are estimated, one addressing the city (demand logistics sustainability index), and the second referring to logistics stakeholders (supply logistics sustainability index). The difference between the two indices, referred to as logistics gap, is also estimated.}

Considering the full use of engine dynamics, the two motors are matched in the case of using the engine’s external characteristic strategy, and they are solved under the limit conditions and C-WTVC operating conditions respectively. When energy matching is performed on the super capacitor, the kinematics segmentation is performed on the operating conditions to analyze the energy variation in each segment. Finally, a logistics vehicle model is established in Cruise to simulate the dynamics and economy to prove the reasonable matching method.}

In search of effective demolishing waste management methods the following options are considered in order of priority: reusing, resale, repairing, refurbishing, or other methods, ending with energy recovery, and finally disposal. All these methods are related to planning and organizing supply chains, which here are called reverse supply chains, encompassing physical flows of waste and accompanying information. Detailed examples which occur in logistics of such projects are discussed using an example. Disposal costs and increasingly rigorous waste management laws encourage effective waste management. The research and analyses indicate that launching reverse supply chains within a project has a significant added value for a business.}

The lack of performance measure system (PMS) and unknown development strategies in the low-carbon context hinder the development low-carbon logistics in China. Motivated by this, our research investigates some important issues in developing low-carbon logistics. Based on the triple bottom line framework, a general PMS with 42 indicators from 12 dimensions is developed for evaluating the low-carbon logistics by using the method of multiple-case study and literature analysis. Eight representative and leading logistics enterprises from different logistics sub-sectors in the western China are selected as case enterprises. The barriers and strategies for developing low-carbon logistics are then identified based on 6 propositions. The barriers include the lack of low-carbon awareness, the inconsistency and incompleteness in policies and regulations, the scarcity of qualified logistics professionals, the unreasonable infrastructure and facilities, the low efficiency in logistics operations management, and the disordered transport modes. Effective coping strategies are proposed to deal with these barriers from the 6 perspectives based on the case study. We argue that if these strategies can be implemented well, low-carbon logistics can be developed well in China.}

The close relationship between economic development and logistics advancement receives wide attention from the academia. However, current research on the coordination between economy and logistics mostly focuses on concept interpretation, and qualitative discussions. Very rarely do scholars conduct quantitative analysis on the coordination of metropolitan economy and logistics. To fill this gap, we first examine whether there exist interactions between metropolitan logistics and economy by building evaluation index systems for metropolitan logistics and economy. Then we introduce the entropy method and Granger causality test to evaluate and test the level of logistics and economic development in five cities: Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chongqing, and Tianjin from 2009 to 2013. From the dimensions of regional economic investment, regional economic capacity and strength, we finally test the relationship between three economic subsystems and three logistics subsystems to further validate the relationship between metropolitan economy and logistics.}

In this paper, we present an in-depth multiple-case study that explores this aspect. Results show that host government actions are explained by their dependency on IHOs and the levels of tensions between their interests (i.e., conflicting strategic goals). In addition, a host government's regulatory and enforcement capabilities are important for ensuring that they can safeguard their interests. We derive four stances that host governments can adopt in regulating logistics-related activities: non-restrictive, opportunistic, selectively accommodating and uncompromising. Each of these has different implications for the logistics performance of IHOs.}

The research employs a county level lattice data of transportation and logistics cluster jobs from 2008 to 2012 as well as transport infrastructure variables. The findings reveal that the transportation and logistics clusters are concentrated primarily in metropolitan areas, and to some degree, in nonmetropolitan regions of the U.S. In addition, the transport infrastructure is found to have a positive impact on jobs in the transportation and logistics clusters over the period of the study. Intermodals have the largest effect on jobs, followed by airports, annual average daily traffic on the National Highway Planning Network, railroads, and ports.}

abstract = {In the past few decades, an interest in reverse logistics has attracted the attention of industries and also has become a subject of interest for researchers. However, while reverse logistics is becoming a mandatory element of the supply chain in developed countries particularly due to legislation issues, the subject is still in a state of infancy in emerging economies such as Brazil. In these connections, impediments to reverse logistics implementation must be considered and analyzed, as well as the many different perspectives from the key stakeholders for their development. The objective of this research is to evaluate the interrelationship among reverse logistics barriers from the perspectives of the most important stakeholders in the Brazilian context. For this purpose, a Multi-Criteria Decision Making tool named grey-based Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (grey-DEMATEL) was used to extract a multiple company-customer-government association perspective. Three respondents – one expert from each stakeholder – have been consulted to obtain the pair-wise comparison of barriers. Thus, both the net effect and the importance level of each impediment are provided by means of a Euclidean distance analysis, as well as the similarities and differences among stakeholders’ opinions. The uniqueness of this paper relies on the fact that no previous work was found in the domain of multiple stakeholders’ perspective for reverse logistics barriers. This research uncovers that most of the key barriers from the reverse logistics multiple perspectives framework are from the organizational point of view. This stakeholder holds 10 out of 13 key barriers for RL implementation; as such, it is an important outcome because it indicates that firms may begin product return implementation by first tackling key internal barriers. Moreover, knowing the influential factors in their environment may assist industry managers to better implement and manage reverse flows, and to see through current and future green solutions for reverse logistics.}

Particularly logistic systems have to obey the versatility of CPPS and will be transferred to so-called cyber physical logistic systems, since the logistical networks will underlie the requirements of constant changes initiated by changeable production systems. This development is driven and enhanced by increasingly volatile and globalized market and manufacturing environments combined with a high demand for individualized products and services. Also nowadays mainly used centralized control systems are pushed to their limits regarding their abilities to deal with the arising complexity to plan, control and monitor changeable work and logistic systems. Decentralized control systems bear the potential to cope with these challenges by distributing the required operations on various nodes of the resulting decentralized control system. Learning factories, like the ESB Logistics Learning Factory at ESB Business School (Reutlingen University), provide a wide range of possibilities to develop new methods and innovative technical solutions in a risk-free and close-to-reality factory environment and to transfer knowledge as well as specific competences into the training of students and professionals. To intensify the research and training activities in the field of future work and logistics systems, ESB Business School is transferring its existing production system into a CPPS involving decentralized planning, control and monitoring methods and systems, human-machine-collaboration as well as technical assistance systems for changeable work and logistics systems.}

abstract = {The optimization of the two-echelon logistics delivery and pickup network (2E-LDPN) is a strategical and tactical task which can efficiently be achieved by establishing cooperative alliances. Under the coordination of logistics services providers or logistics facilities of the existing network, high operating costs caused by cross and long distance transportation can be reduced via the inclusive reorganization of the entire network. In order to minimize the total cost, this study simultaneously considers semitrailer truck and vehicle sharing, and establishes a linear mathematical model capable of interpreting real world practices under single or multiple alliances scenarios. An Improved Particle Swarm Optimization (IPSO) algorithm and the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm are reasonably combined into a hybrid meta-heuristics to solve the cooperative 2E-LDPN optimization problem. This algorithm combines the merits of IPSO and ACO with local and global search capabilities, and redistributes customer zones on the basis of region partitioning solutions in order to rationalize transportation activities. Finally, an Improved Shapley value model is applied to guarantee profits allocation's fairness and is proved reliable in term of alliance stability. Empirical results out of a case study in Chongqing city show that the IPSO–ACO hybrid algorithm is superior to three well-known algorithms on the cost solution and the number of iterations. Using the Improved Shapley value model and strictly monotonic path (SMP) selection principles, optimal adhesion sequences for two alliances and a grand alliance are yielded. The implemented transition from two sub-alliances based network to the grand alliance is in line with real-world's practices and provides decision makers with a useful tool for the design of cooperative alliances. In addition, the proposed cooperation strategy and profit allocation method enable companies to increase cost savings and the logistics network's efficiency. Besides, semitrailer truck and vehicle sharing as feature of collaboration conditional clauses reduces the size of transportation fleets, and promotes greener logistics operations.}

For these spare parts, demand rates vary with the diminishing number of operational aircraft, as the aircraft retire out of service. As aircraft approach to the EOL phase, managing the spare parts supply chain becomes more challenging and costly. Before entering the EOL period, the aircraft manufacturer typically requires its customers to place final purchase orders for spare parts for the remaining lifetime of the aircraft. For this problem, we present an algorithm that computes the optimal final order size of components under a budget constraint. By modeling the remaining part inventory as a continuous-time Markov chain, we develop analytical solutions using differential equations for single and two-item cases. After observing numerical difficulty for the multi-item case, we employ a simulation-optimization with a gradient search method. The algorithm finds the spares requirement of aircraft components during the EOL period with aircraft availability which serves as a useful performance metric during the spare part supply chain management under a performance-based logistics (PBL) environment.}

Furthermore, an optimization model consisting of multiple echelons, components, and products is introduced for the RL in multiple periods. A multi-objective mixed-integer linear (MILP) programming model is employed to maximize the total profit, green practices, and on-time delivery with minimization of defect rate in the proposed RL.

From the aspect of sustainable development, i.e. social, ecological and economic efficiency, logistics processes, primarily urban freight transport, are far from optimal. The growth of road freight transport and traffic congestion, air pollution and other negative environmental impact, inefficient land use and growth of the goods delivery costs influence the definition and research of various City Logistics (CL) initiatives. Their sustainability depends on the degree of acceptability and interest by the key stakeholders. For this reason, it is very important to identify problems and assess the impacts of the solution on all stakeholders.

In a two-echelon logistics system, the starting point for goods to be delivered in the urban area is a fulfillment center or city distribution center. From there, the goods are first transported to a satellite, from where they are delivered to their final destinations. To simplify operations, companies, in practice, often restrict the route choices at one or both of the echelons. We study the impact on the delivery cost of such restrictions and conclude that when the number of orders to be delivered is large and the location density of delivery addresses is high, the impact is likely to be small, and the operational benefits probably outweigh the cost increases. To more easily accommodate delivery volume growth and to more effectively handle day-to-day delivery volume variations, we introduce a simple aggregation concept, which leads to quality improvements without affecting operational simplicity. We provide further insight by means of a worst-case analysis for specific geographic topologies.}

abstract = {This paper focuses on the spatial patterns of freight and logistics activities in North America. The recent interest in logistics and warehousing and its impact on the urban environment has prompted research investigating the ‘sprawling’ nature of these firms. Logistics sprawl, i.e. the spatial deconcentration of logistics facilities and distribution centers in metropolitan areas has been examined for several metropolitan areas (Dablanc and Ross, 2012; Dablanc 2014; Dablanc et al., 2014), yielding contrasting results: Atlanta and Los Angeles have experienced strong logistics sprawl between 1998 and 2008 while Seattle has not. The objective in this paper is two-fold. An additional case study (Toronto) is investigated to expand the current understanding of North American logistics sprawl and methodological issues, particularly related to facility identification and location data are discussed. An updated method for analyzing spatial patterns of logistics activity in North American cities is subsequently proposed. This updated method may then be used in the future to re-examine former case studies (Los Angeles, Atlanta, Seattle) as well as to investigate new ones.}

abstract = {Low demand logistics systems with response time based service levels such as service parts supply chains exhibit strong interaction between network design and part stocking decisions motivating integrated models making such decisions simultaneously. Extending the earlier models of single product, single part systems, we formulate a multi-product service parts supply chain design problem with part commonality. In particular, our model captures (1) multiple multi-part products with part commonality across products, (2) system-wide, product-specific, time-based service requirements, and (3) stochastic demand satisfied by facilities operating with one-for-one replenishment inventory policy. We then linearize this naturally non-linear integer program via approximation of fill rate function and introduction of new variables to handle quadratic terms in the constraints. We finally conduct a numerical study to quantify the effects of part commonality on network design and inventory decisions and costs using this linear integer reformulation. Our results show that dedicated parts (ignoring commonality) can lead to significantly suboptimal decisions, not only on stock levels but also on network design (location and demand allocation) decisions. Furthermore, our tests with relatively larger networks show that considering part commonality, even in a sequential approach of deciding network design first and part stocking decisions next, significantly improves the total costs of network design and inventory.}

abstract = {This paper seeks to describe several features of the reverse logistics network design under extended producer responsibility, in which the collection goals and penalties for the management system are established by a regulatory legal framework. To address this design network challenge, the paper develops a mixed integer linear programming model for capacitated facility location, which meets recycling targets and minimize the cost of fines in case of infeasibility, through relaxation of constraints. Consequently, the optimal flows, the configuration of collection, reprocessing and recycling facilities, and the estimation of the monetary transfers necessary for the feasible operation of the optimal management system are computed. To illustrate the usefulness of the proposed model, a numerical example based on the case of out-of-use tires (OUT) in the Gran Santiago city of Chile is considered. Forty-two scenarios are defined by a specific offer of OUT for the year 2020 and a possible ratio of OUT to be collected in the reverse logistic network imposed by the authorities. The obtained results show the optimal sets of service center, collection centers and reprocessing plants for each scenario, allowing to study the maximum benefit/minimum investment to develop a management system under the EPR national law.}

The air transport system is very often the part of logistics chain in intermodal freight transport by using the air containers. Because of this it is necessary to identify and calculate the level of possible constraints that may have the negative impact on the efficiencies of realised logistics chain. This evaluation should be realised by the software application that provides to logistics operators, freight forwarders, carriers and other entities the user friendly interface. Based on the research realised at University of Žilina, Department of Railway transport, there was created Microsoft Excel application that evaluates the level of constraints by setting weights to selected criteria. These criteria represent the possible constraints in proposed logistics chain. Based on these criteria this application evaluates the weights of these criteria by using the multi-criteria analysis method (Saaty method) and compare two different variants of proposed logistics chain with using the air transport system. The result of the software evaluation helps easily to choose the better variant of realisation of logistics chain by the comparison of constraints in two different variants of proposed logistics chains.}

abstract = {Processes in manufacturing and logistics are characterized by a high frequency of changes and fluctuations, caused by the high number of participants in logistic processes and the variety of goods handled and services offered. This dynamic behavior particularly requires well documented processes, but at the same time it also complicates process documentation. Manually documented processes can, e.g., miss details of alternative process branches, and the continuing change in logistic processes renders the documentation quickly outdated. A possible solution approach is to automate the documentation of processes. This automated documentation, if based on transaction and master data from the IT systems connected to the logistic process, is called Process Mining. Being a subfield of Data Mining, Process Mining extracts sequences of activities from event logs in databases. Logistics has the opportunity to greatly benefit from the application of Process Mining, because the identification and tracking of goods in the supply chain involves many IT systems. However, the IT landscape in logistics is heterogeneous, because the data are scattered among different specialized systems for various purposes (e.g., warehousing, transportation planning, and billing) of different companies. Due to this lack of standardization, the data cannot simply be analyzed by a predefined routine. Therefore, additional information beside the stored data should be taken into consideration. Machine Learning offers the possibility to classify single items in large data sets and to categorize these items with regard to the context they are in. Adding context awareness to unstructured event data in logistics has the potential to improve the results of Process Mining. Our research investigates how to apply context awareness based on Machine Learning in Process Mining for logistic processes and demonstrates its performance in a logistic scenario.}

This problem is even more severe in refrigerated transportation, in which temperature control is used to guarantee the quality of the products.

In Joint Route Planning (JRP) cooperation, suppliers and customers jointly optimize routing decisions so that cost and emissions are minimized. Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) cooperation extends JRP cooperation by optimizing routing and inventory planning decisions simultaneously. However, in addition to their economic advantages, VMI and JRP may also yield environmental benefits. To test this assertion, we perform a case study on cooperation between a number of supermarket chains in the Netherlands. The data of this case study are analyzed to quantify both the economic and environmental benefits of implementing cooperation via JRP and VMI, using vehicle routing and an inventory routing models. We found that JRP cooperation can substantially reduce cost and emissions compared with uncooperative routing. In addition, VMI cooperation can further reduce cost and emissions, but minimizing cost and minimizing emissions no longer result in the same solution and there is a trade-off to be made.}

The findings illustrate the major themes by analyzing current and future activities in developing environmentally sustainable logistical activities. In addition, four categories of challenges are identified: customer priorities, managerial complexity, network imbalance, and technological and legislative uncertainties. It is concluded that there is a great need for a holistic perspective where LSPs and product owners together analyze and design future logistical setups. The suggested holistic and integrative model, building on a three-dimensional concurrent engineering framework, provides new opportunities for research. Further research is needed to improve the interrelationship between LSPs and their customers in the development of sustainable logistical solutions. This paper puts forward recommendations for the sustainable development of logistics by combining the results from the case studies with a review of related literature. This will be beneficial for managers and policy makers when they approach sustainable logistical challenges.

Measurement and discussions of logistics cluster competitiveness with a national approach are required to boost agglomeration effects and potentially create logistics efficiency and productivity. This study developed assessment criteria of logistics cluster competitiveness based on Porter's diamond model, calculated the weight of each criterion by the AHP method, and finally evaluated and discussed logistics cluster competitiveness among Asia main countries. The results indicate that there was a large difference in logistics cluster competitiveness among six countries. The logistics cluster competitiveness scores of Singapore (7.93), Japan (7.38), and Hong Kong (7.04) are observably different from those of China (5.40), Korea (5.08), and Malaysia (3.46). Singapore, with the highest competitiveness score, revealed its absolute advantage in logistics cluster indices. These research results intend to provide logistics policy makers with some strategic recommendations, and may serve as a baseline for further logistics cluster studies using Porter's diamond model.}

This paper examines the purchase life-cycles of electronic spare parts and presents a new way of modeling and forecasting spare part demand for electronic commodities in the spare parts logistics services. The presented modeling methodology is founded on the assumption that the purchase life-cycles of spare parts can be described by a curve with short term fluctuations around it. For this purpose, a flexible Demand Model Function is introduced. The proposed forecasting method uses a knowledge discovery-based approach that is built upon the combined application of analytic and soft computational techniques and is able to indicate the turning points of the purchase life-cycle curve. The novelty lies in the fact that the model function has certain characteristics which support describing and interpreting the demand trend as a function of time. The application of our methodology is mainly advantageous in long-term forecasting, it can be especially useful in supporting purchase planning decisions in the ramp-up and declining phases of purchase life-cycles of product specific spare parts. A demonstrative example is used to illustrate the applicability of the proposed methodology. Its forecasting capability is compared to those of some widely applied methods in business practice. From the results, the new method may be viewed as a viable alternative spare part demand forecasting technique in spare part logistics sector.}

Globally, health care organisations have been making structural changes towards centralised warehousing and deliveries. In Northern Finland, material logistics of the public health care system rely mainly on numerous separate order and delivery systems, although logistics needs, ordering and stock in different health care facilities correspond to each other. As centralised logistics in orders and deliveries may lead to remarkable savings, pressure for centralised management is high. This paper analyses how effectively a potential centralised warehousing system can be organised based on its spatial components. These include optimal location of one or more warehouses, delivery network coverage and efficiency of routes, as well as accessibility of health centres and hospitals. The geographic information systems (GIS) -based accessibility analytical framework described in this study applies vehicle routing and heuristic computations to location-allocation of warehouses to potential sites by optimising transport cost with a constraint to provide service to at least 90% of delivery demand. The spatial data include the road network, health care facility locations with rough estimates of freight demand nodes and potential locations of warehouse facilities. The main findings of the study show that majority of health centres and hospitals can be effectively reached by a delivery network based on one or two warehouses. Furthermore, the efficiency of the delivery network does not increase remarkably by increasing the number of warehouses, when measured as driving time.}

Based on data from a survey conducted in the Zaragoza (Spain) Logistics Cluster, and using structural equation modeling, we demonstrate that further agglomeration into a logistics park positively impacts collaboration, and more specifically transportation capacity sharing. We also demonstrate that training positively impacts collaboration between cluster residents, both in terms of transportation capacity sharing and resource sharing, as well as the provision of value added services.

abstract = {This study proposes an optimization model that simultaneously incorporates the selection of logistics infrastructure investments and subsidies for green transport modes to achieve specific CO2 emission targets in a regional logistics network. The proposed model is formulated as a bi-level formulation, in which the upper level determines the optimal selection of logistics infrastructure investments and subsidies for green transport modes such that the benefit–cost ratio of the entire logistics system is maximized. The lower level describes the selected service routes of logistics users. A genetic and Frank–Wolfe hybrid algorithm is introduced to solve the proposed model. The proposed model is applied to the regional logistics network of Changsha City, China. Findings show that using the joint scheme of the selection of logistics infrastructure investments and green subsidies is more effective than using them solely. Carbon emission reduction targets can significantly affect logistics infrastructure investments and subsidy levels.}

abstract = {This paper introduces a mixed integer programming model for production routing problems with reverse logistics and remanufacturing, which are closed-loop production routing problems addressed for the first time. A solution method of branch-and-cut guided search algorithm is developed. Computational results from instances adapted from benchmarks of production routing problems show that, the algorithm is more effective when pickup requests are relative high. The problem is also easier to solve when production or transportation costs are lower. The optimal decisions are insensitive to the location of remanufacturing depot whether it is geographically centered or centered with gravity.}

abstract = {Cost minimization is a key objective in managing logistics services. In this context, a growing interest in quality improvement can be observed. However, service quality is hard to quantify as it is a function of varying customer perceptions over time, of the measurement process and of the analysis of the data gathered. This study examines the logistics service quality by scales developed according to SERVQUAL instrument. A survey of 200 customers of logistics service providers (LSP) was conducted in Da Nang City. The data analysis shows that LSPs in Da Nang city need to improve Research and Development and to develop Customer Care programs.}

abstract = {Nowadays, one of the main functions of logistics is material flow distribution from the producer to the final consumer. Modern scientific methods and models pay attention to numerous tasks at different stages of the logistics system. But, simultaneously, the efficiency of interaction of logistics systems is considered in isolated form not taking into consideration the problems of improving the efficiency of the whole society. Meanwhile, there is a connection between the expenses of trade organizations, industrial enterprises and consumers. This leads to the need to take into account the consumer’s component in the logistics system. The development of logistics approach based on consumer’s profit-loss opens new opportunities to improve the service and the efficiency of the logistics system. Influence of consumer on the efficiency of functioning of logistics system is examined in the article; interaction of logistics system and consumer is defined; prerequisites that determine the need to take into account consumers in the design of logistics systems are disclosed; models that allow determining the integrated effectiveness of their interaction are proposed.}

A model is constructed by tangible properties on machines and environment, regions on the floor and by ranking their mutual relations. An optimized layout is then computed based on the model, the relations and an ergonomic score for the human work tasks, which are automatically computed by digital manikins. The result is an optimized layout, visualized in 3D, with improved logistic routes. The layout tool has been implemented and successfully tested on a relevant industrial case.}

The analysis revealed the decentralization of logistics facilities during the period 1980-2003 and suggested that the asset price bubble during 1986-1991 was likely a significant factor. In addition, the examination of the relationship between logistic facility locations and land-use regulations indicates the challenges that even a relatively common land-use regulation framework faces. The study offers valuable insights into the spatial distribution of logistics facilities in the largest metropolitan area in the world.}

abstract = {In the light of increased environmental concerns and the unsustainability of current construction practices, ‘reverse logistics’ (RL) has emerged as a remedial strategy, whereby decommissioned buildings are salvaged and returned back through the value chain for recovery, refurbishment and reuse. The drivers that impact the uptake of RL are known, but if sustainability outcomes are to be enhanced, the strength of those drivers must be quantified in order to ascertain where efforts should be focused. This study aims to quantify the effects of known drivers on RL, and in so doing identify action items with the greatest potential to positively improve RL outcomes. RL drivers are culled from extant research, and categorized as economic, environmental, or social forces. A conceptual model is developed and tested against questionnaire results drawn from 49 expert respondents active in the South Australian construction industry. The results are analyzed using structured equation modeling. Economic and environmental drivers, such as the continuing relative high cost of salvaged items, along with expediency of cost, time and quality objectives overshadowing regulatory demands for use of such salvaged items, are shown to predict 34% of the variations in implementing RL. Of particular interest is the finding contradicting previous studies, showing that social drivers, such as perceived benefits from ‘going green’ had no significant impact. Thus, the road-map to improving RL outcomes lies in reducing costs of salvaged materials, augmenting environmental policies that promoted their use, and to initiate a regulatory framework to generate compliance. This insight will be of interest to industry policymakers and environmental strategists alike.}

The purpose is to minimize both the expected logistics cost and the Green House Gas (GHG) emissions of the Supply Chain (SC) network, in the context of business environment uncertainty. First, we define a general structure of the closed-loop SC. Second, we provide constructive models to roughly estimate the insourcing and outsourcing logistics costs, and their corresponding GHG emissions. Third, we establish a stochastic plan based on a scenarios approach to capture the uncertainty od demand, capacity of facilities, quantity and quality of returns of used products, and the transportation, warehousing, and reprocessing costs. Fourth, we suggest a programming model, and an algorithm based on the Epsilon-constraint method to solve it. The result is a set of optimal non-dominant green SC configurations, which provide the decision’ makers with optimal levels of logistics outsourcing integration within a decarbonized Supply Chain, before any further low-carbon investment.}

We show that this food rescue and delivery problem is NP-hard and we present a cutting-plane algorithm based on Benders’ decomposition for its exact solution. We introduce a novel heuristic algorithm that combines greedy and local search. We test our approaches using real data from food rescue organizations. Our results show that the proposed algorithms are able to efficiently provide envy-free and cost-effective solutions.}
